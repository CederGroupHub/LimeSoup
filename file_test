                "The efficiency and accuracy of operation of a rolling mill depends on the design and quality of the rolls, the main parameters of which are the wear resistance and the resistance to breakage.",
                "Production experience shows that a wear resistant and simultaneously strong article can be produced by forming the working layer and the core from materials differing in the composition and physical and mechanical properties. Such rolls are manufactured by centrifugal casting that consists in layer-after-layer filling of a vertically rotating mold with melted working layer and then with hot metal of the core. This method provides reliable joining of the unlike layers and formation of a transition zone (with partial mixing of the materials of the working layer and of the core), which prevents breakage of the roll.",
                "The studies aimed at raising the wear resistance concern primarily the working layer of rolls. The resistance of a roll to impact and tensile loads, torques and bending moments arising during rolling depends much on the quality of the core, i.e., its structure, the level of its mechanical properties and the residual stresses. This makes the development of materials for roll cores an important task for roll producers.",
                "According to, the cores of rolling rolls are produced from cast irons and steels, the chemical composition of which is chosen with allowance for partial saturation of their melts with alloying components of the working layer during forming the casting. It is shown in the experimental studies described in that the transition of alloying elements of the working layer into the core affects considerably its structure and properties and thus influences the operating capacity of the forming tool. As a result of this process the material of the core is enriched with chromium, which causes inevitable increase in the fraction of carbide inclusions in its structure and, consequently, a decrease in the strength characteristics. It has been shown that growth in the nickel content in the melt of the core lowers the effect of chromium on the strength level of the roll. At the same time, elevation of the nickel content results in formation of an excess ferrite component, which makes the hardness of the core less uniform and lowers the operating capacity of the roll.",
                "To prevent excess ferritization of the structure and simultaneously increase the level of the mechanical properties of the core of the roll, it has been suggested in to alloy the iron additionally with copper. Partial substitution of nickel in the cast iron studied by copper lowers the chilling and simultaneously makes the structure more homogeneous thus increasing the level of the properties of the core, i.e., the hardness by 20% and the yield strength by 7%.",
                "At the same time, the copper content required for suppression of ferritization of the structure depends on the proportion of the main components in the melt.",
                "The aim of the present work was to study the structure and properties of the cast iron for cores of rolling rolls, which has been alloyed additionally with copper."

                "The study was conducted in two directions: (1 ) determination of the effect of copper on the structure and properties of roll irons with different chemical compositions and (2 ) evaluation of the copper content required for providing the demanded level of core properties.",
                "To estimate the effect of copper on the structure of rollfoundry iron we studied specimens cut from the cores of over 50 rolls obtained under the same hardening conditions with a fixed content of chromium (0.10 – 0.15%) and nickel (0.6 – 0.8%) but different proportions of the other components in the melt (3.19 – 3.4% C, 1.1 – 1.3% Si, 0.29 – 0.54% Mn, 0.05 – 0.10% P, 0.01 – 0.05% S). The degree of their influence on the process of structure formation was evaluated in terms of the carbon equivalent, i.e., $$ {\\mathrm{C}}_{\\mathrm{eq}}=\\mathrm{C}+0.3\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{i}+0.33\\mathrm{P}+0.4\\mathrm{S}-0.03\\mathrm{M}\\mathrm{n}, $$ (1)",

                "The chemical composition, the structure and the mechanical characteristics of the specimens cut from necks of castings were determined according to the active standards. The hardness and the yield strength under static bending (σb ) were evaluated according to GOST 27208–87. The microstructure was studied with the help of a NU2e light microscope and a NIKON-950 digital camera at a magnification of × 100. The laps were prepared by the method of from specimens for mechanical tests. The contents, sizes and volume fractions of the phases and other parameters of the microstructure were determined with the help of a computer system for image analysis.",
                "The results of the measurements were processed in MS Excel using the software for data analysis including statistical methods of variance, regression and correlation analysis. As a result, we obtained analytical dependences and estimates of their errors and reliability."

                "Analyzing the results of the study of the effect of copper on the structure and properties of roll iron with different contents of main components in the melt we established that growth in the carbon equivalent was accompanied by increase in the fraction of ferrite in the structure and decrease in the level of the properties of the melt (Fig. 1). The cast iron specimens without copper were characterized by higher inhomogeneity of the structure and properties than the specimens with copper.",
                "When the copper content in the castings with fixed values of the carbon equivalent is increased, the ferrite content decreases and the properties improve. The studies of specimens with a fixed copper content show that its influence lowers with growth in the carbon equivalent. For example, the introduction of 0.45% Cu into the metal with Ceq = 3.6 has lowered the ferrite content by 16% and raised its properties by 7%; for the alloy with Ceq = 3.8, the figures are 4.3 and 3.6% respectively (Fig. 1a ).",
                "Consequently, the capacity of copper to suppress the process of ferritization of the structure of cast iron lowers with growth in its carbon equivalent. The factor most suppressing the influence of copper on elevation of the level of the properties of roll cores is the silicon content in the cores.",
                "With allowance for this fact, we applied the method of design of experiment and the data of to study the joint action of silicon and copper on the properties of roll cores produced under the same crystallization conditions from cast iron with carbon equivalent Ceq = 3.7 – 3.8 (Table 1).",
                "The results of the tests were used to derive regression equations describing the effect of the content of silicon and copper in the material of the core on the hardness HB and on the ultimate bending strength σb , i.e., $$ HB=211.4+11.08\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{u}; $$ (2) $$ {\\upsigma}_{\\mathrm{b}}=585+19.5\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{u}-8.5\\left(\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{i}\\cdot \\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{u}\\right). $$ (3)",
                "Equations (2) and (3) obtained as a result of experimental studies are adequate. It follows from the equations that growth in the hardness by 11.08 HB and in the ultimate bending strength by 19.5 MPa occurs due to increase in the copper content of the specimens to a maximum value of 0.4%.",
                "Silicon is effective only when it acts jointly with copper. When the silicon content in the specimens is increased to a maximum value (1.8%), the effect of copper on the growth in the ultimate bending strength decreases by 8.5 MPa.",
                "Therefore, it is important to determine the copper content required for providing the demanded level of properties at different silicon contents in the metal of the core.",
                "The analysis of the demands of consumers on the operating reliability of rolls performed in has shown that the hardness of the core should be at a level of 200 – 243 HB and the ultimate bending strength σb should be 570 – 600 MPa.",
                "As a result of the experimental studies of the structure and properties of cores of various chemical compositions we established that increase in the silicon content in the material of appropriate-quality cores requires growth in the copper content. For example, when the silicon content in the cores is increased by 27%, the copper content should be raised by 54% (Fig. 2).",
                "At the same time, the earlier results of show that the proportion of ferrite in the structure of cores, which is decisive for the level of their mechanical properties, is affected considerably by nickel. Its partial substitution with copper reduces the fraction of ferrite and raises the level of the properties. This made us turn to determining the proportion of copper and nickel providing a minimum presence of ferrite in the structure of roll cores.",
                "We studied specimens of castings obtained under the same crystallization conditions with fixed values of the carbon equivalent Ceq = 3.7 – 3.8 and silicon content 1.6 – 1.7% and Cu/Ni ratio varied within 0.0 – 0.6. It is shown in Table 2 that the maximum fraction of ferrite (23.4%) in the structure and the minimum hardness and ultimate strength were detected in the specimens not treated additionally with copper (Fig. 3a ). The mean values of the ultimate bending strength of such specimens were below the level required for reliable operation of the forming tool in a rolling mill.",
                "Analyzing the structure and properties of the specimens containing copper and nickel simultaneously we established that when the Cu/Ni ratio was varied from 0.1 to 0.4, the fraction of ferrite decreased by 3.5% (Fig. 3b and c) and the content of cementite changed inconsiderably. At Cu/Ni = 0.1 only the hardness level increased (by 4.7% on the average).",
                "Only the rolls with ratio Cu/Ni = 0.2 – 0.6 had a level of properties sufficient for reliable operation of the forming tool in a rolling mill (Table 2). When this ratio was increased from 0.2 to 0.4, the hardness increased by 3% and the ultimate bending strength increased by 2.6%. Further growth in the ratio Cu/Ni (0.5 – 0.6) changed these characteristics inconsiderably. The hardness decreased (by 9.6%) to the values typical a cast iron not alloyed with copper (Table 2). Thus, the required level of the properties of roll cores was provided when the copper to nickel ratio in the metal was 0.2 – 0.4."

                "To provide reliability of rolling rolls in operation we have developed a novel composition of cast iron for their cores. We suggest to introduce copper in addition to the main prescribed elements in the melt and to the alloying components that pass from the metal of the working layer during mixing. It has been shown that partial substitution of nickel with copper in the composition studied lowers the chilling of the cast iron and improves the homogeneity of its structure. The demanded operating level of the properties of the core (the hardness and the ultimate strength under static bending) is provided at a carbon equivalent Ceq = 3.7 – 3.8 and a copper to nickel ratio in the core Cu/Ni = 0.2 – 0.4.",
                "It should be noted if we manage to obtain finer and globular-shape graphite in the structure of the iron without changing its proportion, the copper content required for complete pearlitization of the structure may be lowered. However, such a process is possible in the case of the use of composite addition alloys with a high melting point, which will require special actions on the melt during the production. We continue to work in this direction."
