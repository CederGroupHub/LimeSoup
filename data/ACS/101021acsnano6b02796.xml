<abstract><p>The ability to precisely
control the composition of nanocrystals,
similar to the way organic chemists control the structure of small
molecules, remains an important challenge in nanoscience. Rather than
dictating nanocrystal size through the nucleation event, growth of
nanocrystals through continuous precursor addition would allow fine
structural control. Herein, we present a method of growth for indium
oxide nanocrystals that relies on the slow addition of an indium carboxylate
precursor into hot oleyl alcohol. Nanocrystal size and structure can
be governed at a subnanometer scale, and it is possible to precisely
control core size over a range of three to at least 22 nm with dispersities
as low as 7%. Growth can be stopped and restarted repeatedly without
aggregation or passivation. We show that the volume of the nanocrystal
core (and thus molecular weight) increases linearly with added monomer
and the number of nanocrystals remains constant throughout the growth
process, yielding an extremely predictable approach to size control.
It is also possible to place metal oxide shells (e.g., Sn-doped In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (ITO)) at various radial positions within the
nanocrystal, and we use this approach to synthesize ITO/In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> core/shell nanocrystals as well as In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/ITO/In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> core/shell/shell nanocrystals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical">

nanocrystals, the traditional heat-up and hot-injection methods often
achieve this by modifying the kinetics and thermodynamics of nucleation,

with these advancements in our understanding of nanocrystal formation,
selecting appropriate synthetic conditions for a desired nanocrystal
structure remains challenging.</p><p>In addition to modifying the
rate of nucleation, &#x201c;multiple
injection&#x201d; or &#x201c;seeded growth&#x201d; strategies have
been used to synthesize nanocrystals with varying degrees of size
control. Seeded growth strategies, whereby preformed nanoparticles
are mixed with metal precursors and surfactants in optimized ratios,
have shown success in both metal and oxide nanocrystal syntheses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref12 ref13 ref14 ref15 ref16">(11-16)</xref> Secondary rapid-injection of precursors and surfactants into the
original reaction solution can also be used to grow both semiconducting
nanocrystals and nanowires;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18 ref19">(17-19)</xref> however, the above methods are
often limited in their size control and size resolution control. Because
the detailed mechanisms of growth in many of the previous approaches
involve complex processes, such as ripening and aggregation, seeded
growth or &#x201c;dynamic injection&#x201d; strategies often require
careful selection of reaction conditions so as not to induce new nucleation
or product formation with unreacted precursor. Strategies include
isolating (and often purifying) the nanocrystal seeds, lowering the
reaction temperature for shell growth, and carefully selecting the
shell-forming precursor.</p><p>An ideal nanocrystal synthetic method
would allow for a continuous,
layer by layer construction of a nanoparticle at the subnanometer
level, similar to the &#x201c;living metal-polymer&#x201d; idea first
conceptualized by Watzky et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(20)</xref> A continuous
growth synthetic method applicable for a wide variety of inorganic
nanomaterials would allow precise and predictable structural control
analogous to that provided by living polymerization in macromolecular
chemistry. Several groups have recently acknowledged the importance
of more generalizable synthetic methods for assembling complex nanomaterials,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(21)</xref> and suggest the utility of polymer-like control
in nanowire and quantum dot syntheses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20 ref22 ref23 ref24">(20, 22-24)</xref> To achieve such control requires a system in which no new nucleation
takes place during growth, the number of growing species remains constant,
and intermediate nanocrystal cores do not passivate. An ideal synthesis
would permit epitaxial growth of core/shell structures and the seamless
control of concentration gradients within doped nanocrystals. Such
approaches would offer precision and control of the internal nanostructures
and sizes, which dictate the properties of nanocrystal cores.</p><p>Recently, several synthetic approaches have been reported that
employ slow addition of precursor to extend the growth of nanocrystals
and demonstrate some of the potential benefits of continuous growth
processes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25 ref26 ref27">(25-27)</xref> We previously showed that slow addition of metal
oleates into hot oleyl alcohol produced monodispersed nanocrystals
for a variety of binary oxides.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">(28)</xref> The catalytic
esterification reactions that lead to nanocrystal formation seemed
ideal to examine whether these syntheses could be used to carry out
continuous growth of binary oxide nanocrystals and, potentially, to
control the radial placement of dopant atoms in the oxide matrix.
To this end we examined the growth process for indium oxide nanocrystals
during slow addition of precursor under conditions where thermal decomposition
of the precursor does not occur. We show that this process shares
attributes common to living growth in polymers, yielding nanocrystals
with predictable sizes and compositions over a range of three to over
22 nm in diameter. The surfaces of the nanocrystals retain their reactivity,
and thus are amenable to further growth of either the core material
or even doped material. The continuous growth process permits the
synthesis of core/shell nanocrystals with custom radial dopant compositions
that, in turn, allow predictable tuning of the energy of the localized
surface plasmon resonance. The continuous, controlled growth process
offers an intuitive approach to precise and predictable size control
of metal oxide nanocrystals.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>Previously

using this method. Spectroscopic studies reveal the production of
an ester, oleyl oleate, during the synthesis, resulting in the formation

increases, condensation eventually occurs to form metal oxide nanoparticles
stabilized primarily by oleic acid (<xref rid="sch1">Scheme <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="sch1">1</xref></xref>). Metal hydroxide condensation is accompanied

indium oxide in detail because of our interest in the optical and

size and tin doping level. Indium oxide nanocrystals were synthesized
through the dropwise addition (0.3 mL/min) of indium oleate solution
into oleyl alcohol at 290 &#xb0;C. Small aliquots were taken and quenched
by rapid cooling to room temperature. Purified samples were characterized
by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Transmission electron microscopy

a result
of further precursor addition (<xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>a). No nanoparticles were observed immediately after
metal precursor addition began, however crystalline particles were
detected in the reaction solution after the addition of 0.2 mmol of
metal (<xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>c).
Based upon the SAXS data (<xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>a) and corresponding TEM images in <xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>c&#x2013;f, the particle size
increased steadily from 6 to 16 nm as more metal precursor was added.
The relative size dispersity decreased over this addition, and at
core sizes greater than 8 nm, the particles became monodisperse, as
revealed by both SAXS and TEM (1&#x3c3; by SAXS = 7&#x2013;8%). The
absolute dispersity for this data set (plotted in <ext-link xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.6b02796/suppl_file/nn6b02796_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>) remains essentially constant after the addition
of 2 mmol of precursor, suggesting that processes such as ripening
and size focusing are not occurring during the later stages of the
growth process. The size dispersion was even smaller by TEM, 1&#x3c3;
= &#x223c;5% (see <ext-link xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.6b02796/suppl_file/nn6b02796_si_001.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link> for TEM size
analysis).</p><p>SAXS analysis revealed that the number of particles
in the reaction
vessel remained nearly constant through the entire precursor addition
(<xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>b), suggesting
that little coalescence and ripening occurs, and no additional nucleation
begins. Further, if precursor addition was stopped at any point during
the synthesis and the solution left under synthesis conditions for
several hours, nanocrystals did not change shape or size during that
time (see below and <ext-link xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.6b02796/suppl_file/nn6b02796_si_001.pdf">Figure S6</ext-link>). When precursor
addition resumes, growth continues as expected. These attributes are
consistent with a continuous growth process analogous to that found
in living polymer chemistry.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">(34)</xref></p><p>If
the nanocrystal cores remain reactive, there should be no upper
limit to the nanocrystal size that can be produced. Under standard
synthetic conditions, we were initially unable to grow nanocrystals
larger than 16 nm (<xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>a). Because alcohol is consumed during nanocrystal growth,
we hypothesized that this may be due to the consumption of all the
alcohol initially in the reaction vessel. By adding more alcohol to
the reaction flask during the synthesis, larger nanocrystals were
obtained. SAXS and TEM analysis (<xref rid="fig3">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref></xref>) confirm the synthesis of monodisperse nanocrystals
up to 22 nm in diameter. We expect that larger sizes are possible
through the continued addition of precursor, assuming enough alcohol
is present to continue esterification. For a typical batch, over 3.0
g of monodisperse 22 nm nanocrystals were obtained as a solid powder
(see <ext-link xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.6b02796/suppl_file/nn6b02796_si_001.pdf">Figures S3 and S4</ext-link> for further SAXS

exhibits
several signatures that are common to living polymerizations. First,
as mentioned above, precursor addition can be halted, left at reaction
temperature (or room temperature), and restarted without any change
to particle size or size dispersion (see <ext-link xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.6b02796/suppl_file/nn6b02796_si_001.pdf">Figure S6</ext-link> and <xref rid="sec3">Methods</xref> section). Second, we
observed a linear correlation (<xref rid="fig3">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref></xref>b) between the average mass of a nanocrystal core and
the addition of metal precursor up to a mass of at least 25 million.
In typical living polymerizations, because the number of growing chains
is constant, a linear correlation between monomer conversion and polymer
molecular weight is observed.</p><p>We suspected that the surface
hydroxyl groups are responsible for
sustaining nanocrystal growth (or, alternatively, terminate growth
if the hydroxyls become passivated or dehydrate to an oxo species)
as shown in <xref rid="sch1">Scheme <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="sch1">1</xref></xref>. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether nanocrystal growth
can be sustained in their absence by eliminating the hydroxyls through
reaction with a long-chain silane reagent. To this end, we synthesized
10.4 nm In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanocrystals. Half of these nanocrystals
were treated with trimethoxy(octadecyl)silane. A TEM of the silane-treated,
purified product is shown in <xref rid="fig4">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref></xref>a, along with an EDX and XPS spectra indicating the
presence of silicon (<ext-link xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.6b02796/suppl_file/nn6b02796_si_001.pdf">Figure S5</ext-link>). No discernible
changes in the size or dispersity of the nanocrystals were observed
during silanization. When additional metal precursor was added to
the silane-coated particles, significant changes in morphology and
polydispersity of the sample were observed (<xref rid="fig4">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref></xref>b). The anisotropy of the grown nanocrystals,
along with the presence of two populations of nanocrystals (one much
smaller than the original), imply that growth on existing cores was
hindered and new nucleation occurred. When additional precursor was
added to the untreated nanocrystals, growth continued as expected,
producing larger, monodisperse nanocrystals. (<xref rid="fig4">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref></xref>c). These results suggest that continuous
growth occurs through monomer addition to the surface hydroxyl groups</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>TEM images

By TEM, all nanocrystal sizes have a sub-10% size distribution. The
slightly higher percent polydispersity found by SAXS is likely the
result of differing degrees of shape anisotropy in the sample. Because
SAXS is a scattering based method of analysis, small shape anisotropies
can contribute to a larger modeled polydispersity. Dopant-induced

be &#x223c;5 nm within the nanocrystal core.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">(40)</xref> Additional attenuation of these signals occurs in the ligand shell.
As the In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> shell thickness increases from
0.6&#x2013;3.3 nm, the intensity of the Sn 3d peaks steadily decrease,
suggesting that the dopant (tin) is being confined to the nanocrystal
core as the In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> shell is grown. For the 12.8

the nanocrystal does not contain tin in the shell of the material.
If tin were redistributing itself in the nanocrystal homogeneously,
one would expect a little over 1 at. % tin present, which is easily
detectable in this measurement. Two other features of the XPS spectra
support these conclusions. First, the In 3d peaks narrow as In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is grown, suggesting that undoped In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> dominates the signal produced in the outer portions
of the nanocrystals. Second, the systematic decreases in the baseline
intensity at binding energies &gt;455 eV (attributed to inelastic

of aliquots taken over this time show no further growth or aggregation

mixture was slowly added to the reaction mixture, and the particles
were grown to reach 10.4 nm. Finally, additional indium oleate was
slowly injected to reach a final diameter of 13.6 nm (see <ext-link xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.6b02796/suppl_file/nn6b02796_si_001.pdf">Figure S7</ext-link> for TEM images). XPS spectra of aliquots

core size and dopant
distribution in indium oxide and tin-doped indium oxide nanocrystals
via a slow-injection synthetic method. Rapid esterification, rather
than thermal decomposition, produces reactive species that condense
with active hydroxyl groups on the nanocrystal surface leading to
continuous, controlled growth. The reactivity of the surface hydroxyl
groups is important because if they become passivated, nucleation
of new nanocrystals occurs rather than the growth of the existing
cores. The method possesses several of the beneficial attributes of
living growth processes common in polymer chemistry: (i) the number
of growing nanocrystals remains constant, (ii) the size distribution
of the nanocrystal cores remains low throughout the process, (iii)
the molecular weight of the nanocrystal core scales linearly with
the amount of precursor added, and (iv) the growth can be stopped
and restarted making it convenient to grow shells of differing compositions.</p><p>This approach allows the synthesis of rationally designed core/shell
materials with predictable dopant densities and desired shell and
core sizes. We utilized this method to synthesize ITO/In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> core/shell nanocrystals, as well as In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/ITO/In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> core/shell/shell nanocrystals.
The similar reactivities of the matrix and dopant precursors under
esterification conditions means that dopant concentration is easily
controlled through the ratio of precursors used. Under the conditions
employed for synthesis, dopants do not redistribute throughout the
nanocrystals. Convenient access to semiconductor nanocrystals with
deliberately controlled radial distributions of dopant ions will permit
studies to probe how such distributions influence the optical and
electronic properties of these materials.</p><p>Slow-injection syntheses
that produce reactive species through
controlled reactions, (such as the esterification process described
here), hold promise to produce a wide range of mixed metal oxide and
doped metal oxide nanocrystals with desired dimensions and composition
profiles. Chemistries that generate a reactive nanocrystal surface
and produce controlled mixtures of reactive species that condense
with the surface groups would, more generally, allow more controlled
syntheses of nanocrystals with specific overall or local compositions.
Such methods would serve as a springboard for the development of other
types of nanomaterials, in addition to oxide nanocrystals.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Materials

dividing the volume fraction by the volume of one particle. We were
concerned that a SAXS model generated from a spherical form factor
might produce inaccuracies because particle shapes ranged from truncated
cubic to cuboctahedral. However, generated SAXS patterns will be directly
proportional to a nanocrystals&#x2019; core volume, and when the appropriate
