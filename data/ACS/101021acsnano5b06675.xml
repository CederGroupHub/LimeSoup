<abstract><p>Sulfur-porous
carbon nanotube (S-PCNT) composites are proposed
as cathode materials for advanced lithium&#x2013;sulfur (Li&#x2013;S)
batteries. Abundant mesopores are introduced to superaligned carbon
nanotubes (SACNTs) through controlled oxidation in air to obtain porous
carbon nanotubes (PCNTs). Compared to original SACNTs, improved dispersive
behavior, enhanced conductivity, and higher mechanical strength are
demonstrated in PCNTs. Meanwhile, high flexibility and sufficient
intertube interaction are preserved in PCNTs to support binder-free
and flexible electrodes. Additionally, several attractive features,
including high surface area and abundant adsorption points on tubes,
are introduced, which allow high sulfur loading, provide dual protection
to sulfur cathode materials, and consequently alleviate the capacity
fade especially during slow charge/discharge processes. When used
as cathodes for Li&#x2013;S batteries, a high sulfur loading of 60
wt % is achieved, with excellent reversible capacities of 866 and
526 mAh g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> based on the weights of sulfur and electrode,
respectively, after 100 cycles at a slow charge/discharge rate of
0.1C, revealing efficient suppression of polysulfide dissolution.
Even with a high sulfur loading of 70 wt %, the S-PCNT composite maintains
capacities of 760 and 528 mAh g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> based on the weights
of sulfur and electrode, respectively, after 100 cycles at 0.1C, outperforming
the current state-of-the-art sulfur cathodes. Improved high-rate capability
is also delivered by the S-PCNT composites, revealing their potentials
as high-performance carbon&#x2013;sulfur composite cathodes for Li&#x2013;S
batteries.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical">

(Li&#x2013;S)
batteries are considered as a promising candidate to replace current
Li-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their low cost, benign environmental
effects, high specific capacity (1675 mAh g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>),
and high energy density (2600 Wh kg<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref2 ref3 ref4">(1-4)</xref> Commercialization of current sulfur cathodes generally suffers from
fast capacity degradation and poor Coulombic efficiency originated
from the dissolution of intermediate discharge products (polysulfides,
Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4&#x2013;8</sub>) in the electrolyte.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(5)</xref> The polysulfide dissolution causes loss of active
sulfur and suppresses its deep lithiation, which becomes especially
severe during slow charge&#x2013;discharge processes and deteriorates
the electrochemical performances at low cycling rates. Besides, compared
to commercial LIB cathodes mostly with loading of active materials
larger than 80 wt %, it is quite difficult to achieve high sulfur
loading due to its low conductivity (5 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2013;30</sup> S cm<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>). Currently reported sulfur cathodes with
encouraging electrochemical performances had sulfur loadings mostly
around or even smaller than 50 wt %. A further increase of sulfur
content in cathodes could cause severe polarization, poor cycling
stability, low capacity, and decreased Coulombic efficiency.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6 ref7">(6, 7)</xref> Therefore, it is of urgent need to fabricate cathodes with high
sulfur loading, high capacities, and large capacity reversibility
simultaneously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8 ref9 ref10">(8-10)</xref></p><p>Carbon-based materials with optimal porosity
and high surface area,
such as mesoporous carbons,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7 ref11 ref12">(7, 11, 12)</xref> graphene,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref14">(13, 14)</xref> porous carbon nanofibers,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref16">(15, 16)</xref> and carbon spheres,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18">(17, 18)</xref> have been widely used to accommodate
sulfur and constrain polysulfides <italic>via</italic> physisorbtion.
Among these porous structures, those with mesoporosity are considered
of great promise due to their proper pore size and large overall pore
volume, which ensure electrolyte access for fast lithium transport,
provide abundant adsorption points for high sulfur loading, and alleviate
active material loss <italic>via</italic> physical adsorption. Improved
cyclic stability and high Coulombic efficiency were reported in these
mesoporous structures; however, most of them were designed into powder-like
morphologies with limited interior interaction. Therefore, the use
of polymeric binders and carbon black additives was required to ensure
the mechanical stability and electrical connectivity in the electrode.
Unlike in LIBs, where binders effectively hold the active materials
without interrupting the electrochemical process, binders in Li&#x2013;S
batteries could play a critical role in the cell performance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(19)</xref> As the structure and morphology change upon
cycling, binders cannot hold all the active materials, especially
the soluble polysulfides. Instead, they could become &#x201c;dead&#x201d;
sites for the electrochemical reactions that can deteriorate the cell
performance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(19)</xref> Therefore, it is important
to develop binder-free sulfur cathodes in order to facilitate green
fabrication processes, allow high active material loading, increase
electronic conductivity, and achieve excellent electrochemical performances.</p><p>Carboneous materials fabricated into various morphologies, including
carbon fibers,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(20)</xref> vertically aligned carbon
nanotubes,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(21)</xref> carbon nanotubes,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22 ref23 ref24">(22-24)</xref> and graphene,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(25)</xref> have been utilized as
supportive skeletons to construct integrated binder-free carbon&#x2013;sulfur
composites, of which the ones based on superaligned carbon nanotubes
(SACNTs) have shown unique advantages. On the basis of many attractive
characteristics, including large aspect ratio (&gt;10<sup>4</sup>),
clean
surface, and strong intertube interaction, SACNTs have been widely
used to support binder-free electrodes in LIBs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26 ref27 ref28">(26-28)</xref> Binder-free
sulfur electrodes were also developed <italic>via</italic> a facile
ultrasonication-assisted method.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">(29)</xref> Excellent
high rate performance was obtained in the S-SACNT composite due to
the highly conductive SACNTs and efficient electrolyte infiltration.
The absorption ability of the SACNT framework also localized sulfur
and its lithiation products and therefore suppressed the polysulfide
migration. However, only a small sulfur loading of around 50 wt %
was achievable in order to retain microstructural homogeneity, high
conductivity, and stable cycling behaviors. Besides, the cycling stability
at lower rates such as 0.1C/0.2C was unsatisfactory, possibly because
of the obvious loss of active materials in prolonged charge/discharge
processes.</p><p>In order to achieve high sulfur loading and promote
the cycling
performances, the advantages of mesoporosity and binder-free electrodes
were combined in this work and a sulfur&#x2013;mesoporous CNT composite
was fabricated. Abundant mesopores were introduced into SACNTs through
controlled oxidation in air at high temperature to create the porous
CNTs (PCNTs). When employed as sulfur hosts, PCNTs give superiority
of both porous structures and 3D continuous CNT network, which not
only offer abundant mesopores for sulfur incorporation but also construct
a bush-like structure to further adsorb sulfur, therefore achieving
dual confinement to sulfur cathode materials. Furthermore, the high
surface area and large pore volume of PCNTs simultaneously allow a
high sulfur loading and high sulfur utilization. Through a facile
solution-based and ultrasonic-assisted method, highly flexible and
robust S-PCNT composites with sulfur loading varied from 50 to 70
wt % were prepared and directly used as electrodes without binders
or current collectors. Benefiting from the high electrical conductivity,
the mesoporous structure, and the 3D continuous bush-like network,
the S-PCNT composites showed significantly improved electrochemical
performance.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>The synthesis
method of the S-PCNT composites is schematically
illustrated in <xref rid="fig1">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref></xref>. SACNTs were heated in air to allow controlled oxidation and creation
of nanoscale pores to obtain PCNTs. A free-standing and flexible S-PCNT
composite was fabricated <italic>via</italic> a simple solution-based
and ultrasonication-assisted method,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">(30)</xref> followed
by solvent removal through drying. The intensive ultrasonication ensures
nanoscale sulfur to load onto PCNTs and create a uniform sulfur distribution.

according
to the thermal gravimetric behavior of CNTs in air. As shown in <xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>a, effective weight
loss cannot be induced at low temperatures (&lt;550 &#xb0;C), indicating
slow oxidation and insufficient tube defects, while fast and uncontrollable
weight loss happened at high temperatures (&gt;550 &#xb0;C), which
brought
out significant degradation of CNTs. Therefore, effective, controllable,
and time-saving oxidation was conducted at the temperature of 550
&#xb0;C, where the steep weight loss was about to start. In addition,
in order to maintain the large aspect ratio and strong intertube interaction
of pristine CNTs to support a binder-free and mechanically integral
film, the holding time at 550 &#xb0;C was set as 30 min. Shorter holding
time (15 min, <italic>etc</italic>.) cannot introduce enough defects,
and longer holding time (1 h, <italic>etc</italic>.) produced chopped
tubes. Compared to pristine CNTs, PCNTs presented an obviously lowered
oxidation temperature in <xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>a, revealing more open structure and increased chemical
reactivity. The relative intensity of the D and G bands (<italic>I</italic><sub>D</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>G</sub>) increased from 0.74
in CNTs to 0.95 in PCNTs in the Raman spectra (<xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>b), further confirming the presence of surface
defects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31 ref32 ref33">(31-33)</xref> It is notable that although defects were introduced,
the graphite structures of CNTs were basically preserved, as indicated
by the clear (002) peak with high intensity at around 26&#xb0; in
the XRD pattern of PCNTs (<xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>c). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis
of PCNTs (<xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>d)
further revealed the introduction of surface defects and functional
groups during the oxidation process. Apart from the peaks corresponding
to the sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized C&#x2013;C (284.8 eV) and the sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized C&#xe5fb;C (285.1 eV) bonds in the graphitic structure
of the nanotube, the peaks at 286.5 and 288.8 eV revealed the existence
of hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl groups. The last peak at 291.5
eV can be attributed to the &#x3c0;&#x2013;&#x3c0;* transition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">(33)</xref> A large amount of sp<sup>3</sup>-configured
carbon was demonstrated in the PCNTs, with a ratio of 4:3 between
the sp<sup>2</sup>- and sp<sup>3</sup>-configured carbons. As the
peak corresponding to the sp<sup>3</sup>-configured carbon was generally
attributed to the defects on the carbon nanotube structures,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">(32)</xref> the high percentage of sp<sup>3</sup>-configured
carbon in the PCNTs further confirmed the introduction of defects
to the side walls after the heat treatment. TEM examination of CNTs
(<xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>e) and PCNTs
(<xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>f) presented
a visible alteration in morphology and tubular structures before and
after heat treatment. Pristine CNTs presented good tubular structures
as well as clean and smooth shells, with few surface defects, while
in PCNTs, the hollow tubular structures were partially destroyed due
to oxidation of carbon, and a quantity of defects was produced both
on the side walls and on the tubes&#x2019; ends (indicated by the
yellow arrows). The defects revealed in PCNTs, including the chopped
tubes, the open ends, and the &#x201c;bitten&#x201d; points along
the walls, were similar to those created by chemical oxidation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34 ref35">(34, 35)</xref> Considering the large aspect ratio (&#x223c;10<sup>4</sup>) of the
SACNTs used in this work,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36 ref37">(36, 37)</xref> it was reasonable to
consider most of the burned sites located on the sides of the CNT
walls. The water wetting property of the nanotubes was also tuned
by the surface defects and the oxygen functional groups. <xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>g and h show photographs
of water droplets (1 &#x3bc;L) on a CNT film and a PCNT film, respectively.
The CNT film presented hydrophobicity with a large contact angle of
129&#xb0; at the water/CNT interface. This water wetting behavior
was effectively tuned after controlled oxidation. As shown in <xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>h, the water droplet
was perfectly wetting into the PCNT film within a short time, presenting
high hydrophilicity. The superwetting at the PCNT/water interface
resulted in an effective dispersion of the tubes in the water-containing
solvent and allowed the formation of well-dispersed tubes in the composite
structure. To evaluate the dispersive behavior, CNT and PCNT films
were prepared by ultrasonicating CNTs and PCNTs in an ethanol/water
solution followed by drying. Compared to pristine CNTs (<xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>i) with large bundles and tube
aggregation, PCNT films (<xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>j) presented a more condensed structure, alleviated
aggregations, and improved tube dispersion. The condensed structure
of PCNTs was also evidenced by its smaller film thickness. For a typical
film with the same weight of 15 mg and area of 8 cm<sup>2</sup>, the
PCNT film produced a rather smaller thickness of 41 &#x3bc;m than
the 64 &#x3bc;m of the pristine CNT film, revealing increased density
of the PCNT film.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of CNTs and PCNTs. (a) TGA analysis, (b) Raman

S-PCNT composites also benefited
from the PCNT network. As shown in <xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>k, the pristine CNT film exhibited a strength
of 0.46 MPa, while the PCNT film with condensed structure presented
a greatly enhanced strength of 3.65 MPa. The high mechanical strength
of PCNTs was attributed to the well-dispersed nanotubes and condensed
film structure, as revealed in <xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>j. As bundling of tubes in PCNTs was effectively alleviated,
each tube can be effectively entangled with the neighboring ones to
effectively bear the external loading, therefore resulting in an interwoven
film with enhanced strength. Moreover, high electric conductivities
were also demonstrated in the PCNT film. As illustrated in <xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>l, the PCNT film
possessed an improved conductivity of 5.80 &#xd7; 10<sup>3</sup> S
m<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> compared to that of the pristine CNT film (3.50
&#xd7; 10<sup>3</sup> S m<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>), possibly due to the
condensed film structure, increased density, and consequently improved
electronic contact in PCNTs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">(38)</xref> In addition,
improved conductivity was also found to be related to the chemical
functionalization in the oxidized CNT electrode.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39 ref40 ref41">(39-41)</xref> This might
be another reason for the enhanced conductivity in PCNTs.</p><p>With
these appealing characteristics, PCNTs were regarded as a
promising sulfur host to construct binder-free composite cathodes
with large microstructural homogeneity, enhanced mechanical strength,
improved electrical conductivity, and excellent electrochemical performances. <ext-link xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.5b06675/suppl_file/nn5b06675_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link> shows SEM images of the S-PCNT composites
with varied sulfur contents of 50, 60, and 70 wt %. Composites with

with no massive or agglomerated sulfur particles (<ext-link xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.5b06675/suppl_file/nn5b06675_si_001.pdf">Figure S1a and b</ext-link>). When sulfur content was further increased
to 70 wt %, obvious convex areas formed on the surface (<ext-link xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.5b06675/suppl_file/nn5b06675_si_001.pdf">Figure S1c</ext-link>). The magnified image of one convex

PCNTs through the area. Though with no visible sulfur particles, the
sulfur elemental mapping suggested increased sulfur content within
the convex area, indicating locally increased sulfur deposition on
PCNTs. Both the Raman spectra (<ext-link xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.5b06675/suppl_file/nn5b06675_si_001.pdf">Figure S2a</ext-link>) and XRD pattern (<ext-link xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.5b06675/suppl_file/nn5b06675_si_001.pdf">Figure S2b</ext-link>) of the
S-PCNT showed a combination of PCNTs and sulfur, and the sharp diffraction
peak at 23.1&#xb0; in the XRD pattern matched well with that of orthorhombic
sulfur (JCPDS No. 08-0247). TGA analysis of the S-PCNT composites
(<ext-link xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.5b06675/suppl_file/nn5b06675_si_001.pdf">Figure S2c</ext-link>) indicated that the sulfur
contents were 51, 59, and 69 wt % in the S-PCNT (50%), S-PCNT (60%),
and S-PCNT (70%) composites, respectively, roughly in accordance with
those in the raw materials.</p><p><xref rid="fig3">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref></xref>a&#x2013;c

contents. No sulfur particles were visible in the S-PCNT (50%) composite
(<xref rid="fig3">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref></xref>a), while,
at higher magnification, tubes of PCNTs were found to be covered with
a thin layer of sulfur (<xref rid="fig3">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref></xref>d), which was also visible in the S-PCNT (60%, 70%) composites
(<xref rid="fig3">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref></xref>e and f).
The tube&#x2019;s central area of PCNTs in the S-PCNT composite appeared
brighter than the tube walls, which indicated the location of sulfur
in the surface area along the walls of the PCNTs. When the sulfur
content was increased to approximately 60 wt %, nanoparticles mostly

more and larger sulfur particles (10&#x2013;50 nm) in the composite

to investigate
the pore-size characteristics of the CNTs, PCNTs, and S-PCNT composites.
As shown in <xref rid="fig5">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref></xref>a and b, both adsorption curves of pristine CNTs and PCNTs showed
a gradual increase near the relative pressure (<italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic><sub>0</sub>) of 0, which suggested the existence of micropores
(diameter &lt;2 nm), and a sharp increase near the relative pressure
of 1.0, which indicated the existence of macropores (diameter &gt;100
nm).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">(35)</xref> Besides, the N<sub>2</sub> adsorption/desorption
volume of PCNTs was considerably higher than that of CNTs whether
at low or high pressure, suggesting abundant pores generated after
oxidation. Distinctive hysteresis was found in the relative pressure
(<italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic><sub>0</sub>) range of 0.4&#x2013;1.0
in the PCNTs, revealing a mesoporous microstructure. The pore structures
revealed here agree well with the TEM images in <xref rid="fig2">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref></xref>e and f. After oxidation, not only were some
of the tube tips opened, but also the tube walls were corroded with
defects, both of which created abundant mesopores on the surface along
the side walls or on the tube ends in the PCNTs. The created mesopores
also gave rise to a high surface area of 523.4 m<sup>2</sup>/g in
the PCNTs, about 2.13 times that in pristine CNTs (245.9 m<sup>2</sup>/g). After sulfur was incorporated into the PCNTs, the hysteresis
of the isotherms became almost absent (<xref rid="fig5">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref></xref>c), with the surface area decreased to 330.4
m<sup>2</sup>/g. The absence of mesopores and the decease of surface
area in the S-PCNT composite indicated that the introduced sulfur
preferred to locate in the open pore structures along the side walls
in the surface area of the PCNTs. This might be attributed to the
improved affinity between sulfur and the defects created on the PCNTs.
The Barrette&#x2013;Joynere&#x2013;Halenda desorption pore size distribution
is given in <xref rid="fig5">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref></xref>d. Pristine CNTs exhibited two mild peaks at 3.46 and 31.75 nm, corresponding
to the pores between neighboring tubes and among bundles, respectively.
After heat treatment, a sharp peak was found at the pore diameter
of 3.54 nm, which arose from the introduced defects on tube walls
and openings at the tube tips. At the same time, the mild peak suggesting
an interbundle porosity of 31.75 nm became slightly lower. According
to the SEM images, this could be attributed to the well-dispersed
tubes, weakening of aggregation, and consequently densification of
the PCNT film. Both the peaks at 3.54 nm and the shoulder at 31 nm
became lower in the S-PCNT (50%) composite, further confirming the
deposition of sulfur into the created mesopores along the side walls
in the surface area of the PCNTs. Note that similar isotherms and
pore size distribution were obtained in S-PCNTs (60%, 70%) (<ext-link xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.5b06675/suppl_file/nn5b06675_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>), suggesting that the created mesoporosity

compared to a pure PCNT film, high conductivities were still achieved
in the S-PCNT (50%, 60%) composites (4.24 &#xd7; 10<sup>3</sup> and
3.80 &#xd7; 10<sup>3</sup> S m<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>), as shown in <xref rid="fig6">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref></xref>a. The comparable
conductivities in these two samples were understandable considering
their microstructures. In S-PCNTs (50%), most sulfur particles located
within the mesopores on the walls and therefore can be easily intimated
by the conductive network and exhibit high conductivity. When the
sulfur content was raised to 60 wt %, excess sulfur particles anchored
closely on the tube walls without aggregation, ensuring accessibility
to the PCNT network and resulting in similar conductivity to S-PCNTs
(50%). However, when the sulfur content further increased to 70 wt
%, larger sulfur aggregates and convex areas were present in the composite,
leading to localized poor electron connection and consequently low
overall conductivity (1.74 &#xd7; 10<sup>3</sup> S m<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>). High mechanical strengths of 2.50, 1.59, and 0.99 MPa were also
delivered in the S-PCNT (50%, 60%, and 70%) composites (<xref rid="fig6">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref></xref>b), about 5.43, 3.46, and 2.15
times those in pristine CNTs. It is notable that the strength of the
S-PCNT (50%) composite was also much higher than that of the S-CNT
(50%) composite reported previously (0.62 MPa),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">(30)</xref> indicating the advantage of PCNTs as a mechanical support.
The high strength of the electrodes was supposed important to avoid
cracks or voids and maintain the mechanical stability of the electrode
during cycling. Besides, high flexibility was also demonstrated in
the S-PCNT composites. As shown in the inset of <xref rid="fig6">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref></xref>b, freestanding composites were formed without

comparable capacities of 1180 and 1163 mAh g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> were
obtained in the S-PCNT (50%, 60%) composites respectively, followed
by a relatively lower capacity of 1034 mAh g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> in
S-PCNT (70%). Two discharge plateaus at about 2.3 and 2.0 V were clearly
found in the S-PCNT (50%, 60%) composites, while in S-PCNT (70%),
the second plateau became lower than 2.0 V, possibly resulting from
the high resistance and consequently increased polarization. This
was also confirmed by the relatively lower charge transfer resistance
in the electrochemical impedance (EIS) spectra (<ext-link xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.5b06675/suppl_file/nn5b06675_si_001.pdf">Figure S4b</ext-link>) and sharper cathodic peaks in the cyclic voltammeter

0.6, 0.8, 1, 2 and 5C, the S-PCNT (50%/60%) composites continued to
deliver larger capacities of 1077/1088, 1023/1018, 950/938, 904/892,

to 0.2C after 60 cycles, the capacities of the two electrodes recovered
to 1049 and 1021 mAh g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup>, respectively, indicating
the good stability of the composite structure. It is notable that
impressive rate capability was also obtained in the S-PCNT (70%) composite,
with capacities of 912, 842, 790, 753, 701, and 655 mAh g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> at 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, and 5 C in sequence. As a contrast, in the
S-CNT (50%) composite using pristine CNTs as sulfur host, smaller
capacities and inferior reversibility were delivered. In addition,
as pristine CNTs cannot be effectively dispersed in ethanol/water
solution, large sulfur aggregates appeared at higher sulfur loadings
(&gt;50 wt %), resulting in large microstructural inhomogeneity and
dramatically
reduced capacities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">(29)</xref> When considering
the total weight of the electrode, the advantage of the S-PCNT was
even more obvious. With the large capacities and high sulfur loading,
the S-PCNT (60%/70%) composites delivered high capacities of 700/714,
656/632, 613/579, 571/548, 541/521, 503/485, and 452/427 mAh g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> based on the weight of the electrode at 0.2, 0.4,
0.8, 1, 2, and 5C, respectively (<xref rid="fig6">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref></xref>c), showing their great potential as high-performance
cathodes for Li&#x2013;S cells. In comparison, the S-PCNT (50%) composite,
although having high capacities based on the weight of sulfur, presented
smaller capacities of 588 (0.2C), 542 (0.4C), 477 (0.8C), 452 (1C),
439 (2C), and 423 (5C) mAh g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> based on the weight

Similarly to the rate test, when based on the weight of sulfur, the
S-PCNT (50%, 60%) composites presented comparable capacities of 1268
and 1264 mAh g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> initially, and these values dropped
to 886 and 866 mAh g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> after 100 cycles, with capacity

of 1109&#x2013;760 mAh g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> were observed in the

of 68.5%. When considering the total weight of the electrode, the
largest capacities were obtained in the S-PCNT (60%/70%) composites,
which delivered capacities of 762&#x2013;526 and 776&#x2013;528 mAh
g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> based on the weight of the electrode in 100
cycles, respectively (<xref rid="fig6">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref></xref>d), larger than those in the S-PCNT (50%) composite. All cells
showed high Coulombic efficiencies around 100%, declaring the uniform
sulfur distribution and the efficiency of the highly porous PCNT framework
in retarding the shuttle of polysulfides. The cycling performances
of the S-PCNT composites also presented large advantages over the
S-CNT (50%) composite, which can deliver capacities of only 685 mAh
g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> based on the weight of sulfur and 342 mAh g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> based on the weight of the electrode after 100 cycles
with a low capacity retention of 57.4%. The average sulfur lithiation
degree and the percentage of active sulfur participating in the electrochemical
reaction were examined by analyzing the capacity contribution from
the two discharge plateaus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30 ref42">(30, 42)</xref> As shown in the inset

composites exhibited a high lithiation degree of about 1.6&#x2013;1.2
throughout 100 charge/discharge cycles, while the S-PCNT (70%) composite
exhibited relatively small but acceptable lithiation degrees of around
1.5&#x2013;1.1. The increased lithiation degree of sulfur was ascribed
to the highly porous structure and improved sulfur affinity in PCNTs
that effectively localized sulfur cathode materials and consequently
alleviated polysulfide dissolution. Moreover, high sulfur utilization
was achieved in the S-PCNT composites. As plotted in <ext-link xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.5b06675/suppl_file/nn5b06675_si_001.pdf">Figure S4f</ext-link>, the S-PCNT (50%/60%) composites possess a high

67.2/68.7% in the first, 20th, 40th, 60th, 80th, and 100th cycle,
respectively. In comparison, the S-PCNT (70%) composite exerted relatively
low sulfur utilization, possibly due to the large sulfur aggregates

access.</p><p>On the basis of <xref rid="fig6">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref></xref>c,d and <ext-link xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.5b06675/suppl_file/nn5b06675_si_001.pdf">Figure S4d,e</ext-link>, one

corresponding to the capacity decay rates of 0.093% per cycle. Notably
enhanced stability was achieved in the S-PCNT (60%) composite at 0.5C
compared to that at 0.1C due to the speeded up discharge process,

the strength before cycling (1.59 MPa). This might be attributed to
the further homogenized sulfur distribution in the composite film
during the charge&#x2013;discharge process and the residual lithium
salts in the interior region of the composite film, both of which
acted as &#x201c;glues&#x201d; to mechanically reinforce the film.
The EDX analysis shown in the inset of <xref rid="fig6">Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref></xref>f revealed the existence of elemental sulfur

electrochemical performance
of the S-PCNT composites can be explained by various synergistic factors
in the novel nanostructures. First, improved dispersive behavior and
alleviated aggregation were achieved in PCNTs <italic>via</italic> controlled oxidation of SACNTs, which led to condensed composite
structures and increased electronic conductivity. Meanwhile, high
flexibility and sufficient intertube interaction were maintained in
PCNTs, allowing the construction of integrated composite structures
without binders and conductive additives. Second, oxidation in air
introduced numerous defects in the PCNTs, which provided improved
sulfur affinity, intimate sulfur&#x2013;PCNT contact, and homogeneous
sulfur distribution. Therefore, sulfur particles can attach to the
conductive network easily, resulting in high conductivity in the S-PCNT
composite. Third, abundant mesopores and a high surface area were
created in PCNTs after oxidation. The porous structure not only facilitated
high-loading sulfur to deposit onto or into it but also played important
roles in adsorbing polysulfide anions, suppressing polysulfide diffusion,
and minimizing sulfur loss. Fourth, the greatly enhanced mechanical
strength in the condensed PCNT network also provided mechanical integrity
and stability to the composites, which additionally contributed to
the excellent electrochemical stability during cycling. Compared to
micropores with diameters smaller than 2 nm, the pores in the PCNTs
were large enough to allow ready access by electrolyte and preserve
fast lithium ion transport to sulfur. The relatively open pores also
allowed sulfur to locate into these pores <italic>via</italic> interface
adsorption through a simple solution-based method.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Sulfur&#x2013;mesoporous CNT composites were synthesized by incorporating

The PCNTs were fabricated <italic>via</italic> facile and cheap oxidation
of SACNTs in air and presented improved dipersive behavior, higher

high sulfur loading, suppressed polysulfide dissolution, and minimized
loss of active sulfur. These appealing characteristics of PCNTs rendered
the S-PCNT electrodes with high specific capacity, excellent rate
performance, and long cycle life, exceeding that of S-CNT electrodes.
The S-PCNT (60%) composite delivered a high initial capacity of 1264

after 100 cycles at 0.1C, with 866 and 526 mAh g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> based on the weights of sulfur and electrode, respectively. Even
with a high sulfur loading of 70 wt %, the S-PCNT composite can maintain
a capacity of 760 and 528 mAh g<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> based on the weights

for 30 min. When they were cooled to 500 &#xb0;C, the calcined SACNTs
were taken out of the furnace and rapidly cooled to room temperature
to obtain PCNTs with mesoporosity. During the heat treatment, a weight
loss of around 10 wt % was present, indicating a reaction between
CNTs and air.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>Fabrication of S-PCNT Composites</title><p>The S-PCNT composite
was prepared <italic>via</italic> a facile solution-based method reported
previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">(30)</xref> Sulfur powder (Beijing Dk
Nano Technology Co., Ltd.) and PCNTs were simultaneously suspended
in a water/ethanol mixed solution. The mixture was intensively ultrasonicated
using an ultrasonication probe (1000 W) for 30 min to form a uniform
suspension. The resulting mixture was then dried at 50 &#xb0;C to
remove the solvent, and a binder-free and flexible S-PCNT nanocomposite
was detached from the container. S-PCNT composites with sulfur loadings
of 50, 60, and 70 wt % in the raw materials were prepared, marked
as S-PCNT (50%), S-PCNT (60%), and S-PCNT (70%), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><title>Material
Analysis</title><p>X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
were characterized using a diffractometer (Rigaku, Cu K&#x3b1; radiation).
Raman spectra were recorded on a Horiba spectrometer (514 nm Ar laser,
24 mW). Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted on a Pyris 1 TGA
(PerkinElmer, USA) at a heating rate of 5 &#xb0;C min<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> in air from 25 to 500 &#xb0;C. XPS analysis was carried out on a
PHI Quantera II (XPS) surface analysis equipment. C 1s XPS spectra
was deconvoluted into Gaussian&#x2013;Lorentzian-type peaks after
applying a Shirley background. The contact angles and surface contact
areas of the water droplets on the CNT and PCNT films were measured
using an optical microscope. The sheet resistances of the S-PCNT composites
were measured by a four-point method using a ResMap system (Creative
Design Engineering Inc., USA). Tensile tests were performed using
an Instron 5848 microtester with a strain rate of 1% min<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> and a 1 cm gauge length. The microstructure and elemental analysis
were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (Sirion 200,
FEI) and a transmission electron microscope (Tecnai G2F20, FEI). The
Brunauere&#x2013;Emmette&#x2013;Teller measurements were performed
on a surface area and porosity analyzer (ASAP 2020).</p></sec><sec id="sec4.5"><title>Electrochemical
Measurement</title><p>Coin-type half-cells were
assembled in a glovebox filled with protective argon gas (M. Braun
Inert Gas Systems Co. Ltd., Germany) with the S-PCNT composites as
the working electrodes and pure lithium foil as the reference electrode.
A polypropylene film (Celgard 2400) was used to separate the cathode
and the anode. A 1 mol L<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> concentration of lithium
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LITFSI) and 0.2 mol L<sup>&#x2013;1</sup> LiNO<sub>3</sub> in dimethyl ether and 1,3-dioxolane with a volume
ratio of 1:1 were used as the electrolyte. The cycling tests were
made on a Land battery test system (Wuhan Land Electronic Co., China)
at 1.8&#x2013;2.6 V at different charge/discharge rates. The rate
tests were performed by charging the electrode at varied charge rates
while discharging at a constant rate of 0.2C. The electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed
on a potentiostat/galvanostat (EG&amp;G Princeton Applied Research
273A).</p></sec></sec></body><back><notes id="notes-1" notes-type="si">
