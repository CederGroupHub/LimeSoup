                "Sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy was used to study surface immobilization effects on the interactions between antimicrobial peptide cecropin P1 (CP1) and model cell membranes. While free CP1 in solution interacted with a model cell membrane composed of a phosphatidylglycerol (PG) bilayer, electrostatic interaction led to the attachment of CP1 molecules onto the PG surface and the hydrophobic domain in the lipid bilayer enabled the peptides to insert into the bilayer and form α-helices from random coil structures. While CP1 molecules immobilized on a self-assembled monolayer interacted with PG lipid vesicles, the intensity of the SFG peak for the peptide α-helix decreased as the PG vesicle concentration increased. It was believed that when surface-immobilized CP1 molecules interacted with lipid vesicles, they lay down on the surface or became random coils. When the immobilized CP1 interacted with a PG lipid monolayer on water, the strong interaction led to the lying-down orientation of all of the surface-immobilized peptides as well. Differently, no significant interactions between surface-immobilized CP1 with the mammalian cell membrane model 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayer were observed. Our results suggest that, instead of membrane insertion, the electrostatic interactions between the surface cationic charges of CP1 and anionic bacterial membranes may play an important role in the antimicrobial activity of the surface-immobilized CP1 peptide."

                "The therapeutic potential of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) has been explored for the last decades owing to their efficacy against drug-resistant bacteria. − In general, AMPs in solution act by disrupting bacterial cell membranes, causing membrane permeabilization, breakdown of membrane potential, and ultimately cell death. The cationic charges of AMPs facilitate the binding to anionic bacterial membranes by electrostatic interactions over mammalian cell membranes which are less net negatively charged, imparting the selective activity of AMPs to bacteria. In addition to antibiotic use, AMPs have been immobilized onto solid surfaces as antimicrobial coatings for killing bacteria and preventing the bacterial attachment and biofilm formation. − However, surface immobilization of AMPs has been reported to directly affect their antimicrobial performance (e.g., efficacy, selectivity, and durability). − Many studies showed that tethering parameters including peptide surface density, peptides orientation, and surface functionality significantly influence the antimicrobial functions of surface-bound AMPs. − The molecular strategy of AMP immobilization remains challenging as to retain the antimicrobial activity of AMPs after immobilization. This is likely due to, at least in part, a gap in our knowledge on the molecular mechanism of surface-tethered AMPs for killing bacteria.",
                "As compared to those in solution, it has been difficult to characterize molecular conformations and orientations of AMPs at solid/solution interfaces in situ, which are critical parameters to determine the ability of AMPs to capture and kill bacteria. − This is due to the lack of appropriate analytical methods which can provide sufficient surface sensitivity and/or in situ capability to probe molecular structures of AMPs at solid/liquid interfaces. It is important to understand the molecular behaviors of immobilized AMPs to capture and kill bacteria for design and development of highly effective AMP-tethered antimicrobial coatings toward biomedical applications and beyond.",
                "In this study, we investigated the interactions between surface-immobilized AMP cecropin P1 (CP1) and model bacterial cell membranes using sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy. SFG vibrational spectroscopy is a second-order nonlinear optical spectroscopy and has been demonstrated to be a powerful technique to probe and characterize the structures and orientations of peptides/proteins at solid/liquid interfaces in situ. − ,− In our previous work, we have successfully applied this spectroscopic method to deduce interfacial orientations of a variety of peptides and proteins, − ,− providing detailed information on how peptides and proteins molecularly behave on surfaces or at interfaces. We will further extend our approach to study surface-immobilized CP1 peptides while interacting with lipid molecules.",
                "CP1 is a cationic 31-amino acid peptide with a hydrophobic C terminus and a charged/amphiphilic N terminus. While disordered in solution, CP1 adopts an α-helical conformation capable of membrane disruption upon binding to bacterial cell membranes. The activity of CP1 is selective to bacteria over mammalian cells. Recently, surface-immobilized CP1 has been extensively studied as pathogen-selective capture molecules for the use in the biosensor system and in antimicrobial coatings. − To investigate the molecular action of immobilized CP1, we previously prepared CP1-immobilized surfaces through a cysteine residue added to the C-terminus (CP1c). The thiol group of cysteine was coupled with the maleimide-terminated self-assembled monolayer (SAM). Escherichia coli cells attached on the surface were found stained by a LIVE/DEAD viability dye kit, indicating that the immobilized CP1 killed bacteria on contact. Our previous SFG study demonstrated that the CP1c helix had a single orientation tilting toward the surface normal (∼35° vs the surface normal) in water. Molecular dynamics simulations have also supported the experimental results obtained from our SFG study. However, these SFG and computational studies present the molecular behavior of surface-immobilized CP1 in the absence of bacteria. It remains unclear how the surface-immobilized α-helical CP1 peptides interact with bacteria for their antimicrobial activity.",
                "It is well-known that AMPs in solution kill bacteria by disrupting bacterial cell membranes. , It has been thought in the research field that immobilized AMPs also act by disrupting bacterial cell membranes in similar to those free in solution, but no direct evidence has been presented in literature. In this study, we examined interactions between the CP1-immobilized surface and a model bacterial membrane as well as a model mammalian cell membrane using SFG spectroscopy. Specifically, we wanted to determine (1) whether the surface-immobilized CP1 molecules change their conformation and/or orientation upon contacting with a model cell membrane for antimicrobial action, (2) whether such changes in the conformation and/or orientation of CP1 are selective to lipid compositions (bacteria-type vs mammalian cell-type membrane) to exert their selective activity to bacteria over mammalian cells, and (3) whether the surface-immobilized AMPs have a molecular behavior similar to free AMPs in solution or not."

However, these materials block the SFG input infrared (IR) beam in the amide I frequency range of 1500–1800 cm–1; therefore, they cannot be used as substrates for near total reflection SFG experiments. To solve this issue, CaF2 right-angle prisms were chosen as the substrates, on which a thin layer of SiO2 was deposited for the growth of SAMs with silane.",

                "Prior to studying the molecular behaviors of immobilized CP1, we first investigated the interactions between CP1 free in solution and the CaF2-supported POPC and POPG lipid bilayers that were prepared by the published method. − Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) lipids are anionic lipids abundant in bacterial cell membranes, whereas the major component of mammalian cell membranes is zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine lipids. Therefore, the POPG and POPC lipid bilayers present model bacterial and mammalian cell membranes, respectively. These lipid bilayers were placed in contact with CP1 buffer solutions with a peptide concentration of 3.74 μM. SFG spectra were collected from the lipid bilayer/CP1 solution interfaces. A strong amide I signal of CP1 was observed from the POPG lipid bilayer/CP1 solution interface (Figure a). This result suggests that CP1 molecules were bound to the bilayer surface with order. This is consistent with our previous results on CP1-DPPG bilayer interactions. Cationic CP1 was likely to bind to anionic POPG lipids by electrostatic interactions. The amide I signal shown in Figure a is dominated by a peak centered at ∼1650 cm–1, indicating that the interfacial CP1 molecules associated with the POPG bilayer adopted an α-helical conformation. For an α-helix peptide, the χpppχssp signal strength ratio (taken after fitting the ppp and ssp SFG spectra) can be used to determine its orientation as shown in our previous publications. In Figure a, the fitted χpppχssp ratio was determined to be 1.1, but it is outside of the possible range for a delta or Gaussian orientation distribution of a helical peptide, indicating that the orientation of CP1 α-helices has a multiple orientation distribution. A previous study reported that CP1 α-helices accumulated on the bacterial cell membrane surfaces in a “carpet-like” way to increase membrane permeation rather than vertically inserting into the lipid bilayer to form pores. Our result indicated that the CP1 α-helices did not adopt a single orientation.",
                "On the other hand, the SFG spectrum collected from the POPC bilayer/CP1 solution interface showed no discernible SFG signal in the amide I frequency region (Figure b). This result suggests that either CP1 molecules did not bind to the POPC lipid bilayer at all or they bound to the lipid bilayer surface but not forming secondary structures or lying down without ordered orientations to generate SFG amide I signal in the SFG spectrum. The binding of cationic CP1 peptides to the zwitterionic POPC lipid bilayer may not be favorable, resulting in rather weak interactions as compared to binding to the anionic POPG lipid bilayer. Because the POPC lipid bilayer presents a mammalian cell membrane model, the weak interaction of CP1 with the POPC lipid bilayer appears to reflect low hemolytic activity of CP1. ,"

                "Next, we investigated the interaction between the surface-immobilized CP1 with model cell membranes. For previous SFG studies on interactions between model membranes and peptides free in solution, substrate-supported lipid bilayers have been frequently used − and SFG spectra were collected from the lipid bilayer/peptide solution interfaces. Here, we used lipid vesicles in solution which could freely interact with the surface-immobilized CP1 to mimic the situation in which the immobilized peptides capture the bacteria from solution and kill them on contact. The lipid extrusion method was utilized to prepare POPC or POPG lipid vesicles in a diameter of ∼100 nm. It should be noted that the size of the CP1c peptide is only a few nanometers, which is much smaller than the size of lipid vesicles used in this study. Therefore, the curvature effect of the lipid vesicles on the interaction between CP1c and the lipid vesicles could be neglected (or most of the peptides “saw” flat lipid bilayers).",
                "The SFG spectrum in the amide I range of the immobilized CP1c was first collected from the SAM (with peptide)/water (without lipid vesicles) interface (Figure a). A strong amide I band with peak centering at 1650 cm–1 was detected, indicating that the immobilized CP1c spontaneously adopted an α-helical secondary structure without interacting with lipids, as we demonstrated previously. SFG amide I spectra were then collected from the interfaces between the surface-immobilized CP1c and POPG vesicle solutions with different vesicle concentrations (Figure a). The SFG amide I signals had reduced signal intensities compared to that collected from the CP1c/water interface without vesicles. Also, the signal intensity was decreased more significantly as the vesicle concentration increased (Figure a). The SFG signal is still centered at ∼1650 cm–1, indicating that the majority of the surface-immobilized CP1c retained an α-helical secondary structure while in contact with POPG vesicle solutions.",
                "The studies using CP1 free in solution above indicated that there was no apparent interaction between CP1 and POPC lipids or no formation of ordered structures. We therefore should not expect to see any strong interactions between the surface-immobilized CP1c and POPC vesicles. Indeed, POPC lipid vesicles did not change any SFG spectra collected from the interfaces with immobilized peptides in water (Figure b). This result indicates that the α-helical structure of CP1 remained intact, and thus, POPC vesicles did not bind to the peptides on the surface at all. This result clearly shows that the surface-immobilized CP1c interacted with the POPG bilayer (model bacterial cell membrane) and POPC bilayer (model mammalian cell membrane) differently.",
                "We further analyzed the SFG spectra collected from the surface-immobilized CP1c/POPG vesicle solution interface. SFG ssp and ppp spectra from the CP1c/POPG vesicle solution interfaces provided the fitted χpppχssp ratios of 1.54, 1.54, and 1.52 at 0, 0.5, and 2.5 lipid g/L POPG vesicle solutions, respectively (Figure a–c). These results are very reproducible, and the error bars for the measured SFG signal strengths and ratios are smaller than 5%. The similar ratios (1.52–1.54, corresponding to orientation angles of around 35° between the α-helix principal axis and the surface normal) indicate that there was no molecular orientation change when the surface-immobilized CP1 interacted with POPG lipid vesicles. Therefore, what then caused the SFG intensity reduction when POPG lipid vesicles interacted with the immobilized CP1 peptides?",
                "According to the SFG selection rule, a random coil structure of peptide chains generates very weak or no SFG signal. In addition, the amide I signal intensity is zero when the α-helix is lying down on the lipid bilayer surface. Because the interaction with the POPG vesicles did not change the molecular orientation of CP1 helices, the intensity reduction was likely due to the mixed binary population of intact CP1 helices standing up (tilting at ∼35° vs the surface normal) on the surface (high intensity) and those in a random coli structure or lying down (no intensity). One explanation to generate such two different peptide states is that the lipid vesicles bound to only a part of the surface. When contacted with the POPG lipid vesicle, the immobilized CP1 might completely lie down on the surface or unfold to a random coli, which generated no SFG signal and thus reduced the overall signal intensity. On the other hand, the immobilized CP1 molecules not in contact with the lipid vesicles were still tilting on the surface and generated strong SFG signals. As the vesicle concentration increased, the lipid vesicles could cover a larger surface area or more CP1 peptides, leading to lower overall SFG signal intensity.",
                "This is distinctively different from the results of CP1 free in solution. For the case of free CP1 in solution, because of electrostatic attraction, positively charged CP1 molecules could bind to the negatively charged POPG bilayer surface. Because the lipid bilayer has a hydrophobic core composed of alkyl chains, the C-termini of the CP1 peptides could favorably interact with the hydrophobic inner core of the lipid bilayer, enabling the peptides to insert into the lipid bilayer partially or even entirely. Our SFG results above on the free peptide–lipid bilayer interactions indicated that peptides adopted multiple orientations. This is compatible with the fact that peptides may insert into the bilayer with different orientations.",
                "However, when the CP1c was immobilized onto the EG4–Mal SAM surface through the C-terminus, it was no longer available for CP1c to insert to the lipid bilayer. In turn, the cationic amphiphilic N-terminus of CP1 was exposed to the solution and interacted with the POPG lipid bilayer. Therefore, the binding of POPG lipid vesicles would not be favorable for peptide insertion but caused the helices to lie down or possibly denature. Such peptides would not generate SFG signal; therefore, the total SFG intensity observed in the presence of lipid vesicles decreased. It should be noted that our previous research indicated that CP1c immobilized onto a maleimide SAM covered 34% of the surface. Therefore, there was adequate space for all of the peptides to lie down on the surface while interacting with the PG lipid molecules.",
                "Figure d–f shows the fitting results of the SFG ssp and ppp spectra collected from the surface-immobilized CP1c/water and immobilized CP1c/POPC vesicle solutions (with different concentrations) interfaces.

                "In the lipid vesicle experiment described above, the vesicles freely interacted with the immobilized CP1 peptides. Therefore, the electrostatic interactions between CP1 (cationic) and POPG lipids (anionic) played an important role in peptide binding. We discussed that the immobilized CP1c might lie down or be in a random coil upon interaction with POPG lipid vesicles because of the unfavorable interaction between the cationic N-terminus and the hydrophobic core of lipid bilayer. To examine the role of hydrophobic interactions played in the peptide insertion, we designed an experiment in which the surface-immobilized CP1c molecules were brought into contact with a POPG lipid monolayer formed at the air/water interface to force surface-immobilized CP1c molecules to interact with the hydrophobic tails of the POPG lipid monolayer (Figure ).",
                "Specifically, the CaF2 prism modified with surface-immobilized CP1 was removed from water and then placed from the air side on the top of a monolayer of POPG with a surface pressure of 34 mN/m. In the lipid monolayer, the hydrophilic lipid head groups were located on water and the hydrophobic tails were sticking out into air. The CaF2 prism approached from the air side; therefore, the immobilized CP1 peptides interacted with the hydrophobic tails of lipids. When the CP1 was in contact with the POPG lipid monolayer, the SFG signal in the amide I frequency range disappeared completely, showing that immobilized CP1c molecules lost ordering at the interface (Figure b). This may be caused by the adoption of a random orientation distribution of CP1 helices or a lying down orientation. Alternatively, the CP1 peptides may be in a random coil. The result was also different from the partial reduction in the SFG signal intensity of the peptides when interacted with lipid vesicles in the solution discussed above. This could be explained by the difference in two experiments. Here, the surface immobilized with peptides was forced to contact with the lipid monolayer, all of the peptides on the surface could interact with the lipids, whereas the vesicles in solution might not cover all the surfaces as discussed above. On the other hand, no change was found in the spectrum when the POPC monolayer on water was in contact with the immobilized CP1 (Figure c). Although the peptides were forced to contact with the POPC lipids, the interaction did not alter the peptide conformation and orientation, indicating no interaction. Even though here the CP1 peptides interacted with the hydrophobic acyl chains of lipids first, the response of immobilized CP1 was selective to the head groups of the lipids. These results suggest that the charge of lipid head groups is a dominant factor to determine the molecular conformation and orientation of immobilized CP1 during their interactions. Although we expect the interaction between the charged CP1c N-terminus and the hydrophobic tails of POPG would be unfavorable, the electrostatic interactions between cationic CP1 molecules and anionic POPG lipids finally decide the molecular behaviors of immobilized CP1.",
                "The conclusions obtained above from the SFG amide I signals of the immobilized peptide/monolayer lipid on the water interface can be further validated by our SFG spectra collected in the high frequency range. The SFG spectra of the immobilized CP1c in contact with different environments including pure water, a POPG monolayer on water, and a POPC monolayer on water were collected (Figure a) in the range of 2600–3700 cm–1. Such signals contained contributions from interfacial water O–H stretches (centered at ∼3200 and 3400 cm–1), the amide A group of CP1c (∼3300 cm–1), and C–H stretching modes (2800–3000 cm–1). The broadband of the immobilized CP1c contacting with pure water was the same as that of the peptides contacting with POPC monolayer on water, centered at ∼3300 cm–1. We believe that for both cases surface-immobilized CP1c molecules were contacting with water because if POPC monolayer was still present on water, the water signal should be detected. POPC left the surface because they dissolved into water. The 3300 cm–1 peak was mainly contributed by the CP1c amide A group, showing that for both cases CP1 molecules are very ordered at the interface. Furthermore, the spectral features in the C–H stretching frequency region (2800–3000 cm–1) from the CP1c/water and CP1c/POPC monolayer interfaces are similar. Such C–H signals could be contributed by peptides, SAM, and POPC lipids. Because the C–H spectra were similar, such C–H signals detected from the two interfaces here should be dominated by the contributions from peptides and SAM, not the POPC monolayer on water. Therefore, the removal of the POPC monolayer from the surface was proved by both the O–H/N–H stretching and C–H stretching signals.",
                "Differently, the broadband generated from the immobilized CP1c in contact with the POPG monolayer was significantly different from that of the immobilized CP1c contacting pure water or POPC monolayer. The SFG spectrum from the CP1c/POPG monolayer interface was dominated by two water O–H peaks at 3200 and 3400 cm–1, showing that water molecules were ordered at the interface. However, the 3300 cm–1 signal was absent, indicating that CP1c molecules lost ordering at this interface due to strong peptide–lipid interactions, agreeing well with the results obtained from the SFG amide I studies reported above regarding the peptide/POPG monolayer studies.",
                "For further validating our above discussions, we also collected SFG spectra in the high frequency range between the SAM surface (without CP1c immobilized) and different media, including water, POPC monolayer on water, and POPG monolayer on water (Figure b). The three SFG spectra were almost the same. We believe that for both the POPC and POPG monolayer cases, the interaction between the SAM surface and the lipid monolayer surface destabilized the lipid monolayers and either dissolved both the POPC and POPG monolayers or made them random, otherwise the lipid C–H signal should be very strong. The same interfacial water signals for three cases indicated that more likely the removal of the lipid monolayer from the surface occurred. Therefore, for all the three cases, the SFG spectra were contributed from the same SAM/water interface. This again shows that the strong favorable interaction presented above between positively charged CP1c and negatively charged POPG did not remove the POPG monolayer from the surface."

These results suggest that the immobilized CP1 helices lay down (or became random coils) upon binding to the anionic POPG lipid bilayer which is a bacterial cell membrane model. The interactions between CP1c peptides and model bacterial cell membranes are different for the free peptides in solution (insertion and tilting into the membrane) and surface-immobilized peptides (lying down or random coil). It has been reported that surfaces coated with cationic synthetic polymers showed on-contact killing of bacteria. , A study proposed that the surface density of positive charges determined the bacterial killing efficacy, rather than the ability of polymers to insert into and disrupt bacterial membranes.

Regarding the three questions raised above in the Introduction section, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) surface-immobilized CP1 molecules did change their orientation (to lie down) or conformation (to denature) upon contacting with a model bacterial cell membrane which may be related to the antimicrobial action. (2) It was found that the surface-immobilized CP1 actively interacted with the model bacteria membrane (POPG monolayer and vesicle) but not the model mammalian cell membrane (POPC monolayer and vesicle), which shows the selectivity of the surface immobilized AMPs. (3) The surface-immobilized AMPs (lying down or denaturing) have different molecular behaviors from free AMPs in solution (membrane insertion).",
                "We believe that the bacterial inhibition effect of the surface-immobilized peptides comes from the strong electrostatic interaction between the cationic CP1 peptide chains and anionic bacteria cell membranes. To generalize this conclusion, it is necessary to perform systematic investigation on interactions including kinetics between model cell membrane and other AMPs or mutated CP1 with different charges, which will be performed in the future. A lipid vesicle may be too simple to fully represent a cell to understand the AMP–cell membrane interactions. More detailed correlations between the antimicrobial activity of AMPs and surface-immobilized AMP orientation/conformation are under the current investigation on surface-immobilized peptide–cell membrane interactions in situ using live bacteria."
