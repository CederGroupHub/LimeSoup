                "During the process of autoclave formation of thermosetting composite structures, the temperature distribution is strongly influenced by the forming fixture, which then contributes to forming error of the composite structure. On the base of 3D thermomechanical model by the software ABAQUS effects of mold fixture on temperature, stress and deformation are investigated. Numerical simulation results of the composite structure show that the deformation in the two sides and stress in the middle are both maximum. Comparison of composite structures shows that the column mold fixture, in contrast to oblique support mold and vertical plate mold ones, manifests uniform temperature and deformation distributions during the process of autoclave formation. Therefore, from the viewpoint of controlling the deformation of the composite structure, the column mold fixture is superior to the oblique support or vertical plate mold fixtures."

                "1.1. Shear Layer. In the present study, three kinds of forming fixtures are used to study the effect of temperature on stress and deformation distribution in the forming fixture. During autoclave formation process, so long as the thermal expansion coefficient of mold board is not equal to that of composite structure, the interaction happens. Twigg et al. analyzed the influencing factors on the interaction resulted from the difference of thermal expansion coefficients of the mold board and composite structure and revealed that the maximum buckling deformation is mainly related to the length of composite structure along fiber direction, the thickness of structure and curing pressure.",
                "In this study, the shear layer is adopted in the numerical simulation process to describe the interaction. Due to high specific strength and elastic modulus, T300/AG80 composite material has been widely used in aerospace. Its mechanical properties are tabulated in Table 1. In fact, for T300/AG80 composite material, when the temperature is lower than 200°C, material parameters can be supposedly constant according to. The parameters of a shear layer are mainly controlled by the composite material. According to, the main parameters of a shear layer applied to T300/AG80 are thickness (ts) and thermal expansion coefficient of fiber direction along the bottom of component (α s o ), which are constant in the process of simulation analysis, and the values are as follows: t s = 0.055 mm and α s o = − 12.0 ⋅ 10− 6 °C-1.",
                "1.2. Curing Process. During the autoclave formation process, heating or cooling gas circularly flows in the autoclave, thus achieving the uniform temperature distribution. In case of an appropriate fixture structure, the material temperature difference between points in the composite structure is very small at the heating or cooling stages. In this study, temperature variation curve was obtained during the autoclave formation process, as shown in Fig. 1. Here the curing pressure is 0.4 MPa.",
                "1.3. Mesh Generation. Figure 2 presents the geometry of the composite structure. Thereinto, the composite structure is an U-shaped plate-and-shell structure with the angle of 10° between two planes used for a smooth transition, which thin-walled structure configuration is often used in aero- and spacecraft applications.",
                "In the present study, shell elements are used to model the composite structure, as shown in Fig. 3. Fine elements are used to present the angular structure geometry, while another plane structure is composed of coarse elements to save computational time. In Fig. 3, the element dimensions of plane and angular structures are, respectively, 77 × 60 mm and 77 × 1 mm, while the total number of shell elements is 5280. Moreover, alternate layer technique of 0° and 90° is used to fabricate the composite structure, and ten layers are used in this study (Fig. 3b).",
                "For composite structure forming process, the forming fixture is composed of mold and mold fixture. The geometry of mold is the same as that of the composite structure depicted in Fig. 2. Three kinds of mold fixture are put forward, namely, column fixture, oblique support fixture and vertical plate fixture. Figure 4 shows the solid model and mesh generation of oblique support mold fixture. The solid elements are used to model the forming fixture (mold and mold fixture), and their total number is 199,617. The material of mold and mold fixture is steel 45.",
                "2. Results and Discussion. In order to investigate temperature, stress and deformation of composite structure or mold during the curing process, six datum points are chosen, as shown in Fig. 2b and 2c. Points A, B, and C are located at the transverse section of composite structure or mold (Fig. 2b). Points A, D, E, and F are distributed along the longitudinal direction, while the distance between the adjacent two points is 1000 mm (Fig. 2c).",
                "2.1. Temperature Distribution in the Composite Structure. Figure 5 shows temperature curves of the datum points in the composite structure. Insofar as shell elements are used to represent the composite structure, the averaged temperature values are plotted in Fig. 5. During the curing process, the inner surface of composite structure, which directly contacts the gas, has the same temperature as curing temperature, while the outer surface contacts the inner surface of mold, which makes the average temperature of composite structure lower than curing temperature, as shown in Fig. 5. Moreover, the temperature difference between the investigated points exists.",
                "2.2. Stresses and Strains. During the autoclave formation process, the shear stresses between composite structure and mold are generated by the curing temperature and pressure. Mold and composite structure bear the compressive and tensile stresses, respectively. Composite structure has a low shear modulus. The layer of the composite structure contacting the inner surface of mold undergoes the maximum shear stress while stresses in the other layers located farther from the mold rapidly decrease. Therefore, the stress gradient along the composite structure thickness direction is observed, which causes the deformation of the composite structure. Figure 6 displays the stress and deformation curves of datum points related to the curing temperature. This implies that deformations and stresses of datum points along the longitudinal direction respectively increase and decrease with the distance from the middle transverse section. In the transverse section, chamfer position (point B) exhibits the maximum deformation and lower stress, where the defects easily appear during manufacturing of the composite structure. Moreover, as compared with the composite structure, the oblique support fixture produces a smaller deformation at the same datum points. Therefore, during the autoclave formation, the differences in deformations and stresses between the composite structure and forming fixture are the factors causing the springback of the composite structure.",
                "2.3. Effect of Mold Fixture on Stresses and Strains. In order to investigate the effect of mold fixture on stress and strain distributions of composite structure or mold, column and vertical plate mold fixtures are put forward, as shown in Fig. 7. As compared with oblique support fixture in Fig. 4, the column fixture in Fig. 7a has no oblique support structure, while the vertical plate fixture in Fig. 7b utilizes square tubes as a support structure. All the mold fixtures in Figs. 4 and 7 have the same dimensions, except for the support structure of the mold. The total number of elements of forming fixtures with column mold fixture and vertical plate mold fixture is 156,162 and 380,160, respectively.",
                "In the simulation process, the conditions used for the column mold fixture are identical to those of the oblique support fixture. Figure 8 displays temperature, stress and deformation distribution for the column fixture derived by numerical simulation. From Figs. 6 and 8 it can be concluded that evolution laws of temperature, stress and deformation under column mold fixture are the same as those under oblique support fixture. The temperature of the same datum points in the composite structure is higher than that of oblique support fixture, leading to increased deformations and stresses. The difference in mold fixture configuration changes the heating of mold and heat transfer mode. During the autoclave formation process, as compared with oblique support mold fixture, column mold fixture has not only a larger area of the outer surface of mold resulting in more uniform and adequate heating, but also a simpler structure causing smaller stiffness and larger deformations. However, in case of column mold fixture, the difference between deformations in the composite structure and forming fixture is smaller than that provided by the oblique support mold fixture. From the above results, it is concluded that the column mold fixture is better than the oblique support mold fixture from the standpoint of controlling the springback of the composite structure.",
                "The conditions used for the column mold fixture during the simulation process are also identical to those of the oblique support fixture. Figure 9 shows the temperature, deformation and stress distributions during the autoclave formation process for the forming fixture with vertical plate mold fixture. As compared with the results depicted in Figs. 6 and 9, it is seen that the deformation and stress of datum points with vertical plate mold fixture exhibit the same variation law as those for oblique support mold fixture. The maximum deformation of forming fixture under vertical plate fixture is smaller than that under column fixture and larger than that under oblique support fixture, while the stress plots exhibit large differences among the three researched mold fixtures. The above results are also due to the change in structure, stiffness and heat transfer for different mold fixtures. Therefore, different mold fixture patterns strongly influence the stresses and strains of the composite structure or forming fixture via the heating and heat transfer processes. From the viewpoint of attaining a composite structure with a smaller springback, it is necessary that the deformation of the composite structure is nearly the same as that of the forming fixture.",
                "Conclusions. In order to investigate the effect of mold fixture on deformation and stress distribution during the autoclave formation process, column, oblique support and vertical plate mold fixtures have been designed. The following conclusions based on this study can be drawn.",
                "1. The points of the composite structure located closer to the middle transverse section have larger deformations during the autoclave formation process. Defects easily appear in the chamfer position, where the maximum deformation in the whole composite structure is observed.",
                "2. Under the same mold, different mold fixtures greatly influence the temperature distribution of composite structure and mold. The forming fixture with a column mold fixture is optimal from the standpoint of controlling the deformation of the composite structure."
