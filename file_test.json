                "SrMnO3 is a perovskite compound which, unlike most perovskites, can be synthesized in three different but closely related polymorphs. In this paper, an experimental equation of state of the 6H polymorph is reported. The experimentally determined bulk modulus of SrMnO3 increases from 115.6(11) GPa in the 4H polymorph to 143.7(17) GPa in the 6H polymorph, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict a further increase to 172.5(4) GPa in the 3C polymorph. In situ observations of transformations between the three known polymorphs, under high pressure and high temperature conditions, are also reported. The results are compared with extensive DFT calculations and literature, and it is demonstrated that the 6H polymorph is the thermodynamically stable phase between 5.9(3) and 18.1(2) GPa at 0 K. The effect of possible oxygen substoichiometry is also explored, using DFT. Finally, the findings are combined with the existing knowledge of the phase behavior in this system to outline where further knowledge needs to be collected before a pressure/temperature (PT) phase diagram can be constructed for this system."

                "Inorganic compounds with the formula ABX3 very often crystallize in the well-known perovskite structure, or distorted derivatives thereof. In the ideal cubic structure, the unit cell can be described by an AX3 cubic close-packed layer, with. cations in the octahedral holes that are surrounded only by. anions. The packing sequence is abc,. being the first hexagonal layer,. the second layer that covers half the holes in a, and. the third placed on top of. to cover the other half. This class of materials covers. wide range of technologically relevant compounds that can display piezoelectric, ferroelectric, (anti)ferromagnetic, catalytic, semiconducting, metallic, or insulating behavior. Due to the widespread use of materials with this structure, it is worthwhile trying to gain. deeper insight into the factors governing phase stability in this type of system.",
                "Many cases are known where. is either an alkaline earth metal or. lanthanoid while. is. transition metal. In these compounds, the. cation dominates the resulting physical properties, while the. ion is less important (except for the case of magnetic properties if. lanthanoid is used). The. ion, however, has. large influence on whether and how the crystal structure is distorted from the cubic structure. Quite often, the type of distortion can be predicted by the basic Goldschmidt tolerance factor t, which can be calculated from ionic radii. by Eq. (1), (1) t=rA+rX2(rB+rX).",
                "When this value is between roughly 0.9 and 1, the structure found is often corner-sharing with small distortions from the ideal cubic perovskite. If the. ion is too small, tilts of octahedra occur for. < 0.9, serving to reduce the coordination number of A. The resulting structures are often orthorhombic or, as. decreases past 0.85, of the LiNbO3 and later ilmenite types. On the other hand, when. is too large (and/or. too small) and. > 1, face-sharing of octahedra is commonly observed along with unit cells of hexagonal symmetry.",
                "Many of the distorted perovskites transform to the cubic phase when subjected to high temperatures. The effect of high pressure is subtly different. While there are several examples of the cubic phase being induced by pressure, other times the effect of pressure is to distort structures even more (e.g., the post-perovskite transition in MgSiO3 ). Another possibility is transformations that only bring the structure. bit closer to cubic. BaMnO3 is one example of such. compound. The ambient phase displays. hexagonal close-packing (ab stacking of the hexagonal layers as described above) of BaO3 with Mn located in the center of face-sharing oxygen octahedra. This polymorph is named 2H since each unit cell contains two close-packed layers along the. axis of the unit cell and the symmetry is hexagonal. Syono et al. reported that when subjected to high pressure, the packing changes towards cubic close-packed in two steps. The first step is the 9H phase with the packing sequence (ababcbcac), while the second step is the 4H phase with the packing sequence (abac). Again the naming scheme follows the number of close-packed layers in the unit cell and the symmetry.",
                "The above series of transformations can be rationalized in terms of the tolerance factor (calculated throughout this paper using SPuDs and the revised Shannon-Prewitt crystal ionic radii ): Ba2+ is too large to produce the ideal corner-sharing structure at ambient pressure (t. 1.10), but when subjected to high pressures, this ion is more compressible than Mn4+ and O2−, producing. smaller t. At. GPa and 1123 K, the 9H phase becomes favored and at even higher pressure and temperature,. GPa and 1473 K, the 4H phase becomes favored.",
                "When Ba2+ is exchanged for the smaller Sr2+,. marked decrease in the tolerance factor results,. = 1.04. It is therefore not surprising that 4H-SrMnO3 (being closer to the ideal structure) is the thermodynamically stable phase at ambient conditions. Its unit cell can be seen in Fig. 1(a). The fact that the corner-sharing (cubic, 3C) polymorph can be stabilized to ambient conditions (through. nonstoichiometric synthesis route discovered by Negas and Roth. showcases how the 0.9–1.0 cubic range is merely. generalized rule and how clever synthesis routes can be used to end up in metastable phase regions. Following the same line of reasoning as for BaMnO3, it would be expected that 4H-SrMnO3 transforms to 3C-SrMnO3 if subjected to pressure. The 3C-SrMnO3 unit cell is shown in Fig. 1(b). Recently, Søndenå et al. determined the equation of state (EoS) of 4H-SrMnO3 up to 40 GPa and used comparisons with DFT calculations on both 4H- and 3C-SrMnO3 to argue that the latter should be more stable above 12 GPa. However, no such transition has been observed to date.",
                "For SrMnO3, Syono et al. reported the transformation of 4H-SrMnO3 at. GPa and 1123. into. new hexagonal phase which they determined to contain six formula units. They proposed that this phase was isostructural with the high temperature 6H-BaTiO3, which displays the packing sequence (abcacb). The existence of this phase was not discussed in the study by Søndenå et al., possibly because it was only recently solved by synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction (SR-PXRD) by Belik et al.. In the latter study, it was confirmed that the structure of the high pressure phase is of the 6H type. This unit cell is seen in Fig. 1(c). To our knowledge, no investigations of the pressure behavior of 6H-SrMnO3 exist, nor has any suggestions of its magnetic structure been made.",
                "The existence of three different polymorphs at room temperature and pressure is quite unique in the perovskite system and the SrMnO3 system is thus ideal for investigating the effects that structure has on the magnetic and electronic properties in compounds of identical stoichiometry. In the present paper, the room-temperature EoS of 6H-SrMnO3 to 68 GPa is reported alongside that of 3C-SrMnO3-δ to 43 GPa. The room temperature EoS of 4H-SrMnO3 is also extended to 60 GPa. In situ observation of three transformations of SrMnO3 phases are reported: (1) from the 4H to the 3C phase at ∼7.0 GPa and 2000 K, (2) from 4H to 6H at ∼5.9 GPa and 673 K, and (3) from 3C to 6H at ∼6.7 GPa and 1273 K. The results are compared to DFT calculations for all three phases. The calculations have also been used to suggest. magnetic structure of 6H-SrMnO3, to rationalize its Néel temperature, to investigate the effect of oxygen substoichiometry, and to evaluate changes of the band gaps of the 4H and 6H phases versus pressure."

This is noteworthy as the a0 obtained from this measurement lies outside the trend of the full EoS mapping of the 3C phase, which used. fraction of the same sample. This data point has therefore not been used in the fitting of the 3C EoS. Because of the possibility that the experimental 3C-SrMnO3 sample was not fully re-oxidized, it will be referred to as 3C-SrMnO3−δ for the rest of the paper. The effect of substoichiometry on the oxygen position is discussed in detail in Sec. III D."

The equivalent data for 6H-SrMnO3 and 3C-SrMnO3−δ are listed in Tables II and III. The DFT values for V0, K0, and K0′ were obtained by fitting. BM3 EoS to the DFT results.",
                        "When fitting PV data, the values of K0 and K0′ always correlate heavily, which means that merely reporting their final values and their assumed independent uncertainties (as in the tables) is somewhat misleading. To better illustrate the range of values that are equally likely,. plot of the 3σ confidence ellipse in K0 vs K0′ is utilized in Fig. 3. Solid lines show experimental results and dashed lines show theoretical results.",
                        "As can be seen in Fig. 2, DFT systematically overestimates the volume compared to experiment for any given pressure. However, the agreement within. 1%–2% is considered quite satisfactory for perovskite structures. The values of V0 for 4H- and 6H-SrMnO3 polymorphs fit quite well with all previous experimental reports, while V0 of 3C-SrMnO3 shows the largest deviation from other findings.",
                        "The experimental results for 3C-SrMnO3−δ are the least certain and also show the largest difference when compared to theory. The values of K0 and K0′ also correlate with V0, the value of which is probably too large, an effect induced by the oxygen content of the sample being slightly below 3.00. This is discussed further in Sec. III D. The fact that the PV relation was not measured for 3C-SrMnO3−δ to pressures as high as for the 4H and 6H polymorphs also plays. role. 3C-SrMnO3 is expected to be significantly harder than both hexagonal phases as this phase is induced by pressure. This is also what DFT predicts for the 3C-SrMnO3 phase and the cause of the discrepancy is also discussed in Sec. III D.",
                        "The bulk modulus of 4H-SrMnO3 determined here and its pressure derivative are significantly different from all previous reports, especially that of Liu et al.. The values for 6H- and 3C-SrMnO3 are the first ones reported experimentally.",
                        "The first thing to note, when comparing the present results to those from others, is the choice of formalism for the utilized equation of state. Values of the bulk modulus and its pressure derivative obtained from different equations of state are generally not comparable at high compressions. This study utilizes the third order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state as the compression ratio VV0 is smaller than 0.9, below which the simpler Murnaghan equation of state (used in Søndenå et al. and Liu et al.) is no longer applicable. The simpler Murnaghan EoS is shown as Eq. (3), (3) P(V)=K0K0′[(VV0)K0′−1].",
                        "When using the Murnaghan EoS on the presented data (merely for comparison as the fit is inadequate), the values for 4H-SrMnO3 of K0=119(1)GPa,K0′. 4.76(6) are obtained, still significantly different from both previous studies. Likewise, the values K0=151(4),K0′. 5.6(3) are obtained for 3C-SrMnO3−δ using the same approach.",
                        "The different pressure media used across the studies also play an important role. This study used neon which only shows 1% deviation from hydrostatic conditions at 50 GPa, while Søndenå et al. used nitrogen (hydrostatic to 10 GPa. and Liu et al. used 4:1 methanol:ethanol (hydrostatic to 10.5 GPa ). It is worth noting that the calculated results of Søndenå et al. are in better agreement with the present data than their experimental findings. This makes sense as DFT does not take the pressure medium into account and neon behaves closer to the hydrostatic conditions that DFT assumes. Furthermore, Liu et al. reported unsatisfactory placement of the ruby in the DAC experiment which will also contribute to the difference between their results and those presented here.",
                        "Lastly it is worth mentioning that the 4H phase displays anisotropic compression from. to roughly 30 GPa, with the. axis being slightly more compressible. Above 30 GPa compression of the cell is isotropic, keeping the ac ratio constant. See the SM, part 5, for. plot of ac vs P.. similar trend was not observed in the relaxed cells of the DFT calculations."

In their paper, they calculated that this volume should correspond to 12 GPa. Note that this transition pressure ignores the existence of the 6H polymorph, which was synthesized by Belik et al. at. GPa and also does not consider temperature. As will be shown in Sec. III D, the 6H phase is predicted to be stable at this pressure at. K. This indicates that entropy differences between the three phases must play an important role in the stabilization of the 3C phase at this lower pressure and higher temperature.",
                                "The observation of. cubic phase with a>a0 is accounted for when it is noticed that the ambient unit cell of 3C-SrMnO2.78 is larger than that of 3C-SrMnO3−δ. It is concluded that the sample was reduced inside the DAC as. result of the high temperate. Indeed, it is this high temperature reduction which was observed at ambient pressure and 1773. by Negas and Roth and which was used to synthesize 3C-SrMnO3 in the first place. It is also possible that the inert neon pressure medium has an effect. That the onset of reduction moves to higher temperature (i.e., the equilibrium is shifted towards to solid phase) when the sample is subjected to high pressure is as expected when reduction involves the evolution of free oxygen."

Therefore, the possibility exists that the 3C sample is not truly of full SrMnO3 stoichiometry, but is instead SrMnO3−δ, where. could fall in the range of. <. < 0.25. The effect of such substoichiometry has been explored experimentally for several lanthanoid manganates doped with Sr, and also for 4H-SrMnO3, but no calculations of the total energy has been carried out for substoichiometric SrMnO3−δ thus far. In the study on the lanthanoid manganates, the result of reducing Mn4+ to Mn3+ was. lowering of the tolerance factor and an increase in volume. From tolerance factor point of view, this should result in. stabilization of the corner-sharing polymorph, i.e., the cubic phase should be stabilized with respect to the 4H and 6H phases. However, these rules are entirely empirical and proper DFT calculations have to be carried out in order to get. thermodynamic understanding of the behavior of substoichiometric compounds under pressure.",
                                "To simulate the high pressure behavior of SrMnO3−δ, two random oxygen ions (not belonging to the same SrO6 octahedron) were removed from. 4H unit cell. This results in the stoichiometry SrMnO2.5, enhancing the possible effects of oxygen substoichiometry. This cell was then fully relaxed within DFT (coordinates and relative cell vectors) at. fixed volume. The total energy, isostatic pressure, and resulting enthalpy were then extracted from the relaxed cell. For the 3C phase,. 2×1×1 super cell was constructed and an oxygen atom was removed before performing the same type of relaxation and extraction of energy, pressure, and enthalpy. The results of these calculations can be seen in Fig.. where the enthalpy difference between the 4H and 3C structures at the stoichiometry SrMnO2.5 and SrMnO3 are plotted as. function of pressure. Full tables of cell volumes, pressure, and energies can be found in the SM, part..",
                                "The effect of removing oxygen from the 4H and 3C unit cells of SrMnO3 is quite large. Where in the stoichiometric compound, 3C becomes more stable than 4H at 13.5 GPa (see Fig.. in the previous section), once the compound reaches the stoichiometry SrMnO2.5, the 4H structure is more stable at. K at all investigated pressures.",
                                "The DFT BM3 EoS of the 3C phase also changes quite drastically, with K0 decreasing to 121 GPa in SrMnO2.5 from 172 GPa in SrMnO3. It is worth noting that the experimental value of 142 GPa obtained in this study is closer to the theoretical K0 from SrMnO2.5 than that of SrMnO3. The V0′s resulting from ambient PXRD on 3C-SrMnO3−δ and the BM3 fit of the experimental data are in both cases larger than those reported by others, which also suggests that the 3C sample measured was in fact slightly reduced. However, while one might be tempted to deduce the value of. in SrMnO3−δ from. direct interpolation of the change in K0, this is not advisable as reduction also affects the zero pressure volume V0, which in turn correlates heavily with K0.. better option might be to perform. linear interpolation on the unit cell parameter. in the re-oxidized cell. This would lead to an estimated value of. of about 0.1.",
                                "The effect of reducing SrMnO3 is thus likely to have affected our results in two ways by: (1) Destabilizing the 3C phase relative to the 4H phase thus suppressing the possible transition of the latter to the former at high pressure and low temperatures and (2) reducing the bulk modulus of the 3C phase by quite. significant amount.",
                                "Furthermore, as the enthalpy of 3C-SrMnO2.5 is higher than that of 4H-SrMnO3, it must be concluded that the transition observed by Negas and Roth from 4H-SrMnO3−x to 3C-SrMnO3−x at atmospheric (“zero”) pressure is driven by changes in entropy."

Through magnetic susceptibility measurements, Belik et al. found the phase to be antiferromagnetic, with TN. 235 K, slightly lower than that of 3C-SrMnO3 (TN=240K) and somewhat lower than 4H-SrMnO3,TN=280K.",

Since the internal stress tensor did not change appreciably for low-lying spin excitations, it is concluded that the magneto-elastic coupling is negligible in this system and thus it has not been included in the calculations. No magnetic super cells were sampled. The calculated magnetic moments on Mn are 2.22μB for Mn1 and 2.26μB for Mn2 at zero pressure. Mn1 is in the corner-sharing octahedra, Mn2 is inside the face-sharing octahedra. The magnetic moment is calculated by integrating the spin density inside. muffin-tin sphere of radius 0.77 Å. Full tables and figures of the explored magnetic configurations and their respective energies can be found in the SM, part..",
                                "The antiferromagnetic coupling of each Mn-Mn pair along. is the most favored structure. It is plotted as AF1 in Fig. 9(a). The first magnetic excitation corresponds to. ferromagnetic coupling of the Mn ions at the center of face-sharing octahedra. It is plotted as AF2 in Fig. 9(b). The excitation costs 24.5 meV per formula unit, which is close to the thermal energy at room temperature.",
                                "In 4H-SrMnO3, the first magnetic excitation found by Søndenå et al. is 23 meV/f.u. above the ground state, while in 3C-SrMnO3 they found it to be 25 meV/f.u. above the ground state. The first magnetic excitation in 6H-SrMnO3 is thus of very similar energy to the other existing polymorphs. Søndenå et al. calculated 2.47μB per Mn in both the 4H and 3C phases, somewhat larger than the magnetic moments found for the 6H phase.",
                                "By calculating the susceptibility as. function of temperature from the Boltzmann distribution of the energies of the 32 spin configurations (six sites),. crude approximation for the Néel temperature can be found. This is done in the SM, part 8, yielding. broad peak at about 190 K. This is in fairly good agreement with the experimental value of 235. due to the broadening by the finite size of the system and the nature of the approximation.",
                                "As the DFT calculation of the possible magnetic structures and their energies assumed collinear spins and neglected spin-orbit coupling, noncollinear spin calculations were also performed, with. denser mesh of. points. The magnetic anisotropy energy was estimated to be in the order of 0.1 meV per unit cell, resulting in. very slight preference for spin alignment along the. axis.",
                                "Finally, the band gap has been estimated as. function of pressure for the 6H and 4H phases, while the 3C phase is metallic within DFT. The 6H gap starts out at about 1.3 eV at zero pressure, before increasing to. maximum value of about 1.5 eV at 50 GPa after which it decreases. Belik et al. measured the resistivity versus temperature of 6H-SrMnO3 and used this to estimate. transport gap of 0.24 eV. This value cannot be directly compared to the one from DFT, as it is. measure of the barrier for electron transport and as such does not represent the DFT band gap. The 4H gap starts at about 1.8 eV in our calculations and decreases monotonically with pressure. The initial value is similar to the 1.60 eV obtained by DFT by Søndenå et al.. Plots of band gaps versus both volume and pressure are shown in the SM, part.."

This diagram is made by combining the reported synthesis conditions of the 6H phase (points in the 6H stability region), the room pressure investigations performed previously by others (points at “zero” pressure), and the present experimental and DFT results (points at. K).. large PT region results where the 6H phase should be stable. Very high temperatures (above 1800 K) seem to stabilize the 3C phase. If the pressure is too low at these temperatures, the compound loses oxygen while maintaining the cubic structure. This thus introduces an important third dimension to the diagram, namely the value of. in SrMnO3−x. Experiments carried out inside these regions (graded and marked with the corresponding phase name in Fig. 10) or on samples obtained from this region should pay careful attention to whether partial reduction has taken place.",

This would serve to move the stability border of 4H upwards in pressure as one moves along the axis of. in SrMnO3−x. At high temperatures, the entropy of the 3C structure must be greater than that of the 4H structure, evidenced by the fact that the 3C structure was observed in the experiments of Negas and Roth for the stoichiometry. > 0.279. Further calculations would have to be performed in order to establish whether the 6H stability field is expanded or contracted by movement along the third dimension.",

                "A comprehensive study of the phase relations in the SrMnO3 system under high pressure and high temperature conditions has been performed, using both experimental observations and DFT calculations. The compound goes through two phase transitions as pressure is increased, from the hexagonally distorted 4H polymorph, over the less distorted 6H polymorph to the ideal cubic 3C perovskite structure at high pressure and temperatures. Excessive heating results in the loss of oxygen from the compound, even at high pressures. This reduction strongly affects the thermodynamics of the compound and seems to favor face-sharing over corner-sharing at low temperatures, while at high temperatures the entropy of the 3C phase overcomes the enthalpy barrier against transformation, resulting in the corner-sharing polymorph.",

This has the advantage that the EoS for 4H-SrMnO3 could be determined to 61 GPa and the EoS for 6H-SrMnO3 to 68 GPa without observing transitions. Furthermore, reduction of the compound happens easily in the shaded regions of the figure and one should thus perform experiments while paying great attention to the oxygen stoichiometry at these conditions."
