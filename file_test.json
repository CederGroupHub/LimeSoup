                "This paper describes an ongoing project to demonstrate an affordable, safe, and energy-efficient housing technology based on expanded polystyrene (EPS) panels with a cementitious coating. The concepts being described are (1) EPS panels embedded with galvanized steel trusses, steel mesh welded or clipped to the protruding points of the trusses and finished with a coating of cement plaster; (2) fiber-reinforced cement board panels and a core of EPS, glued together with high-strength adhesive, dried under high pressure, and connected with cellulose fiber cement board splines; and (3) EPS panels coated with a fiber-reinforced composite. The scope of this project is to model energy flows, analyze costs, simulate seismic forces, test against environmental conditions, and build pilot houses initially in California, Texas and Afghanistan. Results from air quality and energy flow analyses, preliminary cost modeling, structural calculations, and fire testing are reported. The performance goals address seismic safety; energy efficiency in extreme temperatures to reduce fuel use and indoor air quality hazards; affordability and simplicity of construction, as well as ease of expansion for future development; local employment opportunities and small-scale capital investments; and finally, cultural acceptance through education and adaptation to traditional architecture."

                "The nature of the reaction products generated by exposure of a model cyclic ester, γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL), two cyclic ethers, dioxalane (DIOX) and tetrahydrofuran (THF), and a cyclic alkyl carbonate, propylene carbonate (PC), toward metallic Li at room temperature was examined in ultrahigh vacuum by infrared reflection absorption, Auger electron (AES), and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopies. The features observed in the spectra were consistent with Li butyrate and Li β-keto ester in the case of γ-BL, and a dialkoxide derivative of Li with small amounts of Li oxide for experiments involving PC as the main reaction products. The behavior of both these solvents differs greatly from that found of the cyclic ethers DIOX and THF, for which the XPS spectra yielded small amounts of Li oxide and Li carbide as the only reaction products. These two species are most likely not derived from reactions involving DIOX or THF but rather from reactions between metallic Li and CO desorbed from the walls of the chamber during prolonged dosings. The extent of the reaction involving γ-BL, as evidenced by the loss of the AES peak at 52 eV characteristic of metallic Li, far exceeded that observed with PC and the linear alkyl carbonates reported previously in this laboratory, for which the aforementioned feature could be discerned clearly even after extensive exposure. All these findings agree with those reported by Aurbach et al.1 for experiments involving Li metal exposure to the same solvents in liquid phase, which suggests that conclusions drawn from ex situ experiments of the type originally devised by our research group may also be applicable to reactions in condensed phase, including electrochemical environments. © 2003 The Electrochemical Society.

                "Housing plays a central role in improving the quality of people’s lives in both developing and developed countries. Safe and affordable housing provides personal, social, and economic benefits. Most directly, housing contributes to the health and safety of individual inhabitants. Housing re-anchors the homeless in the community and mobilizes those traumatized by a disaster, impacts especially important in a post-conflict situation. Housing also offers families a platform for economic recovery and is a means of employment generation, requiring intensive unskilled labor and local capital investment.",
                "The approach of this housing project is to scientifically and objectively evaluate available housing designs on the basis of cost-effectiveness, seismic safety, energy-efficiency, and sustainability, in order to address the range of housing needs throughout the world. Though efforts have been directed towards demonstrating this new building technology in Afghanistan, in partnership with Shelter for Life International (SFL), and in California and Texas, with funding from the California Energy Commission (CEC) and the Department of Energy (DOE), the guiding performance goals are framed for worldwide application.",
                "According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average US household spent, in US Dollars (throughout the paper all dollars are US Dollars), about $1,300 on 101 million Btu (1.07 × 108 kJ) of site energy, or the energy consumed within a housing unit, in 1997. Space heating accounted for 30% of that cost and half of that amount of energy. In the US, the EIA estimates an average growth rate of 1% per year in energy consumption for 2001–2025. By 2020, the projected residential energy demand in the US is 24.5 quadrillion Btu (2.59 × 1012 kJ). Hence, the CEC and the DOE are particularly interested in developing energy efficient housing in the US.",
                "This paper presents a rigorous list of performance goals intended to objectively evaluate available housing technologies. These specifications are applicable to both developed and developing countries in a range of environmental and economic settings, and call for materials and designs that promote health and safety while addressing cost and architectural design preferences.",
                "Characteristics defining ideal technologies include: Affordability: housing should be cost effective for residents, including building cost, maintenance cost, life-cycle cost, and resale value. Energy efficiency: materials should have excellent insulation, offering higher comfort in extreme temperatures with minimal use of costly or scarce fuel sources. Durability and safety: technology should be capable of retaining structural integrity under seismic activity and natural hazards such as strong winds, fire, pests, and moisture. Any damage should be superficial and simple and inexpensive to repair. Architectural designs should promote good indoor air quality, providing adequate ventilation and air flow. Economically viable and beneficial: material manufacturing and housing construction should utilize intensive unskilled local labor, encourage realistic capital investments in the region, and take advantage of locally available materials. Cultural Acceptability: material appearance and housing designs should mimic local traditional architecture and be attractive to inhabitants. Rapid applicability: housing design and construction requirements should be simple enough to use as a post-emergency shelter and competitive in quality and cost with winterized tents. Adaptability: housing materials and designs should be easily altered to adjust to changing needs of growing families by easily transforming emergency shelters into larger permanent houses. Homes should be expandable when resources become available, especially in markets where loans and financing are unavailable. Environmental sustainability: materials should be resource efficient, using minimal or no wood and producing minimal waste. Non-proprietary: technology should use simple housing design concepts in order to significantly reduce costs. Easy maintenance: maintenance of technology should be simple and use readily available materials. Reproducibility in other markets: materials should be available worldwide, with minimal imports, and realistic capital investments in facilities employing local labor.",

                        "Twenty-six years of almost continuous warfare coupled with major earthquakes in the past decade have damaged or destroyed much of the housing stock in Afghanistan. Pressure on existing stock is growing rapidly as many of the six million Afghans that fled to Pakistan, Iran and other nations during the war begin to return. A population of 27 million is now struggling to accommodate the estimated 1.8 million refugees who returned in 2002 alone. While funding from the US and other nations is woefully inadequate and unpredictable, some progress is being made. Funds typically go to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), like SFL, with facilities in Afghanistan to assist uprooted people in rebuilding their houses, infrastructure, and communities. In an effort to use local resources and building traditions, as well as to save funds and take advantage of available skills, most of these projects rely on time honored Afghan construction methods, using handmade mud (adobe) bricks. Flat roofs are supported by wood beams covered by layers of branches, woven mats, and finally up to 40 cm of clay. Two-room houses can be built this way for less than $1,000.",
                        "Although inexpensive to build, these traditional homes present major long-term risks. Adobe structures are vulnerable in earthquakes and Afghanistan is one of the most active seismic regions of the world. More than 6,000 people died in two earthquakes 4 months apart which shook the Afghanistan/Tajikistan border in 1998 even though they measured only 6.1 and 6.9 on the Richter scale. An earthquake measuring 6.1 on March 25, 2002 and an aftershock of 5.1 in the Hindu Kush region in the northern part of Afghanistan left at least 1,000 people dead, several hundred injured, and several thousand homeless in Baghlan Province. At least 1,500 houses were destroyed or damaged at Nahrin and several hundred more in other areas of Baghlan Province. Houses in Afghanistan should be designed to meet roughly the same standards as in Los Angeles (4 m/s2 acceleration), but traditional methods founder at much lower levels. Brittle mud walls and roofs fail when shaken and their enormous weight causes disastrous injuries. Although earthquake mitigation measures as used by SFL in Afghanistan allow people more time to leave their adobe homes during seismic activity, alternative solutions need to be pro-actively explored.",
                        "Recent wood scarcities have made traditional construction more difficult. Many NGOs are forced to import wood from Pakistan, Russia, and other countries since decades of deforestation have devastated local timber supplies. Often, the wood for a roof accounts for half of the total construction costs for a house. Those not able to import wood are using inadequate and dangerous roof support structures.",
                        "Wood shortages also underscore the energy crisis facing the nation. Traditional Afghan homes are heated with wood or charcoal, but difficulty in obtaining traditional fuels has forced many to turn to expensive kerosene or imported coal. Kabul has an altitude of 1,800 m and nights are cool, but the winters are very cold (the average January temperature is 27°F or −2.8°C). These factors force a difficult choice between expensive fuel consumption and uncomfortable temperatures.",
                        "Traditional heating and cooking systems also lead to unhealthy air quality inside the homes. While the mud homes are not airtight, fires are not well vented, leading to the dangerous buildup of combustion products. Lung and eye problems resulting from these pollutants have devastating effects, particularly on women, who spend many hours indoors close to stoves and their nearby infants who are even more susceptible."

                "Procedures have been developed in our research group for the identification of reaction products formed on clean Li surfaces upon exposure to solvents of relevance to lithium batteries in gas phase. These experiments are carried out in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopy as complementary vibrational and electronic probes. This paper extends the suite of linear and cyclic alkyl carbonates investigated in previous work, to γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL), a model cyclic ester, as well as 1,3-dioxalane (DIOX) and tetrahydrofuran (THF), two model cyclic ethers, to compare the reactivity of these latter solvents toward metallic Li with that of linear alkyl carbonates."

                "Expanded polystyrene (EPS) was found to be an attractive component in the designs. EPS begins as small pellets that contain a blowing agent like pentane or carbon dioxide. When heated to about 100°C, by steam for example, the expansion of the blowing agent creates a structure with millions of tiny air-filled cells. These pre-expanded pellets are then further expanded in a mold with steam or heat, which causes them to fuse together, creating a very strong and rigid foam structure. The end result is a twenty- to thirty-fold increase in the original volume of the pellets, depending on the density desired. Toxicological tests by manufacturers have shown that fumes from burning EPS represent no greater toxic risk than fumes from natural materials, such as wood, cork, or wool. EPS is an excellent material for home construction because of its low thermal conductivity, moderate compressive strength, and excellent shock absorption. Use of EPS and a reinforced concrete coating circumvents the need for expensive wood in roof construction. In Afghanistan, pellets can be imported from Pakistan or India to be expanded in Kabul at a local steam facility, when a design is to be implemented on a larger scale. This would further the goal of employing local labor and reviving local industry. In the interim, the light weight and modular nature of the panels means that they can be shipped into Afghanistan with relative ease and low cost. For housing in the United States, EPS is widely available across the country. EPS is lightweight and panels can be erected by hand without expensive equipment. Openings can be simply cut out of the EPS and fitted with windows and doors. The following are three building methods being analyzed for use as wall and roof panels. 1. Wire Mesh/Truss Panels—EPS panels are embedded with 10-gauge (2.6-mm diameter) galvanized steel trusses and 14-gauge (1.6-mm diameter) steel mesh is welded or clipped to the protruding points of the trusses. Once the wall and roof panels are erected and connected with wire clips, they are finished with two layers of cement plaster, resulting in a 1-inch (in.) (2.5-cm) coating (Fig. 1). Wire mesh houses have been built in Mexico, California, and Texas. 2. Pressed Cellulose Fiber Cement Board Panels—Panels consist of an inner and outer skin of cellulose-reinforced cement board (autoclaved fine-ground silica, cellulose, and cement) and a core of EPS, glued together with high-strength adhesive and dried under high pressure (83 kPa or 12 psi). Wall and roof panels are connected with splices of the same fiber cement board and screws (Fig. 2). Cellulose-reinforced cement board is non-combustible; durable against precipitation, wind, and temperature extremes; able to maintain its shape; and impervious to decay and pests. This type of structure has been built in Puerto Panasco, Mexico; Washington State; Sholo, Arizona; Birmingham, Alabama; and Nashville, Tennessee. 3. Fiber-Reinforced Composite Panels—EPS panels are erected and connected with an adhesive in a tongue-and-groove scheme, then coated with a layer of adhesive and a 1.3-cm (0.5-in.) thick composite of polypropylene fibers, polymers, and concrete (Fig. 3). This non-proprietary composite recipe needs to be refined with further research and testing and is not ready for implementation at this time.",

                "All measurements were performed in a custom designed UHV chamber equipped with instrumentation required for the cleaning of Li specimens and their subsequent spectral characterization with AES, XPS, and IRAS. As described elsewhere, p-polarized infrared (IR) light emerging from a Mattson Cygnus 25 Fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectrometer was focused at an incident angle of 69° onto the surface of a coin-shaped Li foil (ca. 12 mm diam, 1 mm thick) mounted onto the UHV sample stage (see below). As is customary, IRAS spectra are reported in the form of ΔR/R=(Rref−Rsamp)/Rref vs. wavenumber, where Rref and Rsamp refer to the coadded and averaged single beam spectrum of the Li surface before (ref) and after (samp) solvent dosings. Extensive Ar+ sputtering (ca. 100 h) was found necessary to reduce carbon and oxygen (the only detectable impurities) below the AES detection limit of our instrumentation. Additional details regarding sample preparation and other experimental aspects may be found in previous publications.",
                "Ultrapure DIOX and γ-BL were further purified by repeated freeze/thaw cycles and introduced into the main UHV chamber through a multicapillary array/gas doser as specified in earlier publications. The base and working pressures of the UHV chamber were on the order of 2.0×10−8 and 1.0×10−7 Pa, respectively."

The method of assessment includes, Air quality and heat loss calculations to determine the optimal EPS thickness for the walls and roof, in order to maximize energy efficiency and minimize materials costs. Calculations were made for various levels of airflow and insulation for a typical house with five occupants. These calculations show an optimum level of insulation which minimizes the total of fuel and materials costs. Cost modeling to provide an elemental comparison of the three design methods, plus a proprietary method, for two contrasting markets. Cost information was itemized for each of the elements of the house, allowing for simple evaluations of the relative costs of the various technologies.

Structural calculations to determine gross behavior and stress and deflection patterns under gravity, wind, and seismic loads. The structural simulations used a combination of dead loads, live loads, snow loads, wind loads, seismic loads, and construction loads in modeling potential stresses on the panel homes. Dead loads for the structures were determined based on the panel mass. Live loads, winds loads, and snow loads were standardized for each simulation, with the live and snow loads of 0.96 kN/m2(0.14 psi) used according to an American Society of Civil Engineers standard1. Appropriate regional wind loads conformed to ASCE Standard 7-2002. Construction loads of a standard 344.7 kN/m2 (50 psi) were defined as the pressure applied by two individuals exerting a force of 517 kN/m2 (75 psi) each across a standard 762 mm (30 inch) width. Fire testing to examine the materials’ resistance to flames and heat and determine the level and toxicity of smoke production. The first fire test, which conformed with Uniform Building Code Testing Standard 26-3, was intended as a basic comparison of the panel’s performance to the performance of other materials also used in building applications. The standardized test also served the purpose of completing the certification of the material for use in the United States. The second test was intended to demonstrate the safety of the material during a fire when the oxygen supply to the fire was increased and when the structural integrity of one of the panels directly exposed to the flames was weakened before the fire. This test was accomplished by adding a window cutout in one of the panels that formed the corner where the fire was built.",

                        "Preliminary air quality and heat loss modeling assumed a typical SFL house, 65 m2 in gross area, or 42 m2 of living space in four rooms (see Fig. 6 for similar floor plan). Windows and doors were assumed to be insulated to half the level of the walls and the foundation insulated to a level that matches heat flow through walls, with a lower bound of 2.5 cm of EPS. Air quality calculations and fuel cost estimates assumed an average of five occupants, a heating stove efficiency of 50%, and an annual operating cost of $0.26/l ($1/gallon) for #6 oil. Materials cost estimates assumed an EPS cost of $26.50/m3 ($0.75/ft3), EPS cost annualized at 10% of total, and no charge for the windows, doors, surface treatment, or foundation. Calculations were made for three levels of airflow per person: 7.5 l/s (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 62), 5.0, and 2.5; and five levels of insulation thickness: 16.5 cm (6.5 in.) (wall)/25.4 cm (10 in.) (roof), 25.2 cm (6 in.)/20.0 cm (8 in.), 11.4 cm (4.5 in.)/15.2 cm (6 in.), 7.6 cm (3 in.)/10.0 cm (4 in.), and 3.8 cm (1.5 in.)/5.1 cm (2 in.). Results are presented in Fig. 4. There is a shallow total cost minimum, suggesting an initial specification of 15.2-cm (6-in.) walls and 20.0-cm (8-in.) roofs under the above assumptions. Somewhat less insulation, 11.4-cm (4.5-in.) walls and 15.2-cm (6-in.) roofs, is only slightly less attractive on a life-cycle cost basis. More detailed energy calculations incorporating specific heating sources and fuels and ventilation methods are needed to further this air quality and energy analysis."

These floor plans are based on houses that SFL has built in Afghanistan so that structures will be similar in appearance to traditional adobe homes. The starter house can be expanded easily as the resident family grows or achieves the financial capability for expansion. Other details of cost are difficult to quantify precisely (e.g. transportation to site), but effort was made to determine a relative (not absolute) comparison between designs. For example, foundation costs have not been included, based on assumptions that the four building methods would use the same foundation. (In Afghanistan, the cement necessary to add to a dug-hole foundation filled with rocks costs approximately $30.) A more sophisticated accounting of capital costs per house will be performed later. Costs are summarized in Table 1.",
                        "The costs of some of the systems are difficult to determine exactly because the figures depend on some proprietary information. Based on reasonable assumptions, the non-proprietary fiber composite panel design is the least expensive; however, it is not as fully developed as the other methods. There may be additional polymers necessary to prevent cracking and ease application. Although this composite is not ready for implementation at this time, further research and testing should be pursued because of its potential affordability.",
                        "The commercially available composite is the most expensive compared to the other designs, because it is a proprietary technology. In Afghanistan and other developing countries, where labor rates are lower, more labor intensive construction, like the wire mesh panels, appears to be appropriate, in order to keep costs low and stimulate the local economy. In California and other developed countries, where labor is relatively more expensive and materials like cellulose cement board are readily available, the pressed cement board technology is more suitable, with most of the assembly completed in a factory."

Immediately after spectral acquisition was completed, an IRAS spectrum (reference) was recorded. The surface was then exposed to gas phase γ-BL, while monitoring the reaction progress with IRAS until no further changes in ΔR/R were observed. Following this prolonged dosing, the resulting ΔR/R spectrum (see curve A, Fig. 2) displayed a prominent peak at 1080 cm−1 (C­O stretch), and several strong and weak features in the range 2700­3000 cm−1 (C­H stretches) and 700­1800 cm−1, respectively. The assignments for all these peaks, as well as a comparison with data reported by Aurbach et al. for Li exposed to the same solvent in condensed phase are summarized in Table I. Once the IRAS measurements were completed, the specimen was placed in front of the electron energy analyzer for AES and XPS spectral acquisition.",

Instead, all peaks in this low energy region may be ascribed to reaction products between gas phase γ-BL and Li, as further confirmed by the presence of prominent features at 271 and 503 eV ascribed to carbon and oxygen, respectively. This effect most likely reflects variations in the extent to which the reaction occurs, i.e., alkyl carbonates would yield thin and compact films, whereas γ-BL and ethanol (and presumably other simple alcohols) would generate thicker reacted layers.",

Analysis of the FTIR spectra and complementary information derived from solution phase nuclear magnetic resonance studies led these authors to propose that γ-BL is reduced via a single electron to form the corresponding γ-BL anion coupled to Li, which can either undergo ring opening to yield Li butyrate (see Scheme I and Table I), or nucleophilically attack another γ-BL molecule to form the β-keto ester anion-Li coupled molecule.",

This finding indicates that the presence of inorganic carbonate inhibits γ-BL from reacting with the underlying metallic Li, without modifying the nature of the reaction products. Similar studies involving propylene carbonate (PC) suggest that the Li2CO3 overlayer promoted formation of a lithium alkyl carbonate, as opposed to just Li alkoxide, as observed for bare unreacted Li (see below)."

The testing protocol in both tests followed the Uniform Building Code fire safety testing standard 26-3 for residences, with modifications to the building structure included in the second test. The structure’s performance was evaluated through visual examination during and after the fire to determine structural integrity and material performance, through sensor observation to determine heat exposure and smoke toxicity, and through informal observations of heat flow through the outer walls of the structure.",

The testing panels used 30.5 cm (12 in.) of EPS in the core with a 1.1-cm (7/16-in.) cement board cladding. The pressed cellulose fiber cement board panels were used as a representative example of the various panel options being studied. The structure included a standard sized door with a frame that was used as an observation point for both tests. There was also a window cutout on the right wall that measured 38.1-cm × 66.0-cm (15-in × 26-in.) supported by wood framing. The window was located 35.6 cm (14 in.) from the back wall and 1.06 m (3.5 ft) above the floor of the structure. To pass the examination, the structure had to remain intact for 15 min after the fire was ignited. The panels had to maintain structural integrity under the applied load of the ceiling panel. Additionally, smoke production as measured by a photometer located in the duct above the door cutout could not be excessive, and there could be no visible charring on the outer extremities of the wall or ceiling panels. The standardized test design uses a fire ignited in the vulnerable corner joint of an 2.4-m × 2.4-m × 2.4-m (8-ft × 8-ft × 8-ft) room constructed entirely of structural insulated panels.",
                        "The test results showed that the panels exhibited significant resistance to the heat and flames. In both tests, the flames did not spread beyond the wood crib and ignite the panels, and the foam melted only in those areas exposed to the most extreme heat, ensuring structural integrity in spite of the heat stresses. Damage to the cement board was limited to some cracks near the areas of highest heat and on the ceiling. At the points where the cement board fell away from the EPS core, the foam did not ignite because a thin cellulose skin remained over the foam, protecting the EPS from direct flame (Fig. 7). The heat flow to the outside of the panel was extremely limited, with the exterior cement board remaining cool to the touch as observed informally.",
                        "In the second test featuring the window cutout, the most significant difference from the first fire test was the damage in the area under the window frame. The number and surface area of exposed joints, which were unsealed at the point where the cement board skin intersected the wooden window frame, was much greater than in the previous test. As a result, there was a significant increase in the loss of foam under the window frame.",
                        "Smoke production was minimal in both tests, and the smoke that was produced had limited toxicity. The level of smoke production was interpreted by the testing lab to be significantly below the non-quantified threshold, defined loosely as not “excessive.” The products of EPS combustion are typically carbon monoxide and styrene, with the styrene decomposing further in high heat into carbon and water. The inclusion of a window cutout in the second test did not affect the production of smoke, but informal observations revealed that the concentration of the smoke in the structure was decreased in the second test as a result of air flow through the window. Fig. 8 shows that the maximum smoke production at any time during the first test (where air flow was restricted in the testing room) did not exceed 0.28 m2/s, which occurred at approximately 13.5 min into the test, 1.5 min before the fire was extinguished."

Structural simulations demonstrated that the technology was highly resistant to ordinary and extreme forces, such as high wind, snow loads, and earthquakes. The panel homes were also shown to be safe in fires, and damage was easy and inexpensive to repair.

                        "Unlike the behavior found for γ-BL, no spectral features could be discerned in the IRAS spectrum of Li surfaces exposed to DIOX or THF under otherwise identical conditions. Equally featureless was the room temperature IRAS spectrum of vapor deposited Li films on Ni surfaces which had been first cooled to ca. 150 K while dosing with THF to condense a rather thick layer of frozen material, and later warmed to ca. 300 K to allow evaporation. These observations indicate that the reaction products are either present in amounts below the detection limit, or otherwise do not exhibit features in the spectral region accessible with our equipment. In fact, AES and XPS analysis of these surfaces showed signals both for carbon and oxygen consistent with the presence of Li2O, Li carbide, and other minor contributions. These compounds are, in all likelihood, derived from the reaction of Li with CO desorbed from the walls of the chamber during the long solvent dosings, and not from reaction products involving Li and the solvents themselves. Experiments designed to assess the relative reactivity of various solvents toward metallic Li reported by Aurbach et al. showed that the ethers require periods of weeks for products to be clearly detected, whereas ester-based and alkyl carbonates react over minutes to hours.",
                        "The results obtained for THF are difficult to reconcile with those reported by Ross et al., who identified Li alkoxide as the main reaction product at room temperature based on XPS analysis of THF layers initially frozen at cryogenic temperatures and later heated in stages to high temperatures. As we have suggested in earlier communications, this effect could well reflect photoelectron-induced decomposition of these rather fragile organic materials owing to excessive X-ray irradiation. Efforts are underway in our laboratories to modify our current instrument to allow both XPS and IRAS measurements to be performed at a fixed specimen position, thereby avoiding artifactual features in the IRAS derived from slight changes in geometry which render spectral analysis highly uncertain. If successful, this approach could help resolve this remaining quandary."
