                "In-situ near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy was performed to monitor the oxidation states of Co and CoPt nanoparticles (NPs) of 4 nm size in the presence of H2 and O2 in the pressure range of 1 bar and 36 Torr respectively. Platinum helps the rapid reduction of cobalt oxides in hydrogen at a rather low temperature (38 °C). In addition, reversible changes of the oxidation states of cobalt in the Co and CoPt NPs as a function of cycling oxygen pressure (in the range of millitorr to 36 Torr) are quantified and compared. The role of Pt in the process of Co reducing and oxidizing was explored. Our findings permit the prediction of the cobalt oxidation states as the reaction conditions are altered. The experimental results also suggest the presence of tetrahedral structure of Cobalt oxide that differs from the Co3O4 spinel structure."

                "Cobalt is one of the important transition metals used for catalytic hydrogenation reactions of CO and CO2 to produce gaseous or liquid hydrocarbons. It has. major role to play in the industrial process with. long history of producing synthetic fuels. The reducibility of Co is important for hydrogenation reactions of CO and CO2 while the oxidation property is important for CO oxidation. The oxidation state of Co nanocatalysts is sensitive to the chemical environment and reaction temperature. Recently, thermodynamic phase diagram of Co oxide nanoparticles has been derived based on the surface energies of nanophase and bulk phase of Co oxides. In priniciple, the derived phase diagram predicts the most thermodynamically stable phase of Co oxide under. given chemical environment and temperature. In reality, nanoparticles of Co oxide may be trapped in. metastable phase due to kinetic barriers between the different phases. Thus, it is highly desirable to directly monitor the oxidation states of Co nanoparticles under the variable chemical environment and temperature."

In X-ray absorption, soft X-ray photons promote electrons from the core level into the empty states. Each absorption event produces Auger and secondary electrons, and the total electron yield (TEY) is proportional to the number of absorption events. Different from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in the TEY mode the signals are detected through. conductor (in this case. piece of inert gold foil) to the ammeter instead of electrons going through the vacuum and collected by the spectrometer. Thus this technique allows studying the electronic structure at. much higher pressure. The exploring depth of this technique is around. nm for metal. Nanoparticles were deposited onto. 0.1 mm thickness gold foil using the Langmuir−Blodgett (LB, Nima Technology M611) method.

                "The total electron yield spectra as. function of X-ray photon energy for various cobalt oxidation states are sown in Figure 3. In CoO’s stable structure, Co2+ is octahedrally coordinated with oxygen. Another stable cobalt oxide is the spinel oxide Co3O4, which is formed under ambient room temperature and oxygen partial pressure. In Co3O4, Co3+ is octahedrally coordinated and Co2+ is tetrahedrally coordinated with oxygen, where Co3+Co2+. 2:1. Even though Co2+ Oh is generally regarded as the stable CoO state, in the sample spectrum shown in Figure. stronger feature at photon energy 778.8 than at 780.0 eV suggests the necessity to have. Co2+ Td component that is independent of the spinel oxide. To quantitatively identify the oxidation states of Co in Co and CoPt nanoparticles,. least-squares fitting method is used to fit the spectra with these four references that represent known oxidation states or structures. In Figure 3, one fitting example is given to show how one spectrum was decomposed into the four references. Since the oxidation states composition of the four references are known, the fraction of each individual oxidation state in the Co and CoPt NPs can be obtained and they are plotted in Figure 6. It is interesting to notice that for the spectrum of CoPt NPs, the shoulder at ∼777.4 eV is missing compared with the CoO reference and the spectrum of Co NPs (see Figure 5). This difference could be caused by the change of crystallinity or variation in site symmetry that is induced by the addition of Pt to Co. The slight discrepancies between the original spectrum and the fitting between 783 and 787 eV in Figure. could be caused by the background subtracting or the existence of. small amount of Co hydroxide."

                "Figure. demonstrates the comparison of reducibility of Co in Co and CoPt NPs. All measurements were conducted at one bar of pure He or H2. With the references from refs and oxidation states of Co at the different reducing conditions can be identified. Before introducing H2, Co. edge absorption spectra were obtained in one bar He at room temperature. Co in the as-made CoPt NPs is in. more reduced state compared with Co in the as-made Co NPs. When introducing H2 at 38 °C, the Co is almost completely reduced in the CoPt NPs. While for Co in the Co NPs, one bar H2 at 250 °C still could not completely reduce Co to the metallic state. This striking different condition demonstrates that Pt facilitates effectively Co reduction in the form of bimetallic nanoparticles. Previous study on CoPt layer structure generated by spin coating also demonstrated that Pt helped to reduce Co. This can be explained as Pt is able to dissociate H2 upon H2 adsorption and hydrogen atoms are spilled over from Pt to Co thus makes Co much easier to reduce. An earlier study also shows the size effect on the reducibility of Co NPs, where it is found that the smaller cobalt nanoparticles (3 nm) are easier to reduce than the larger nanoparticles (10 nm). Our results demonstrate. more dramatic effect on Co’s reducibility when introducing the noble metal Pt."

The ratio of He to O2 is kept at 20:1 so the corresponding total pressures change from millitorr to one bar and decrease back to millitorr. At the lower pressure, Co is in. more reduced state in the CoPt than in the Co NPs. This is illustrated by the higher fraction of Co0 and lower fraction of Co2+ for Co in the CoPt NPs than in the Co NPs. At the low pressure, Co3+ occupy very little or zero fraction. When the pressure is increased toward 36 Torr partial O2 pressure (one bar total pressure), the fractions of Co0 and Co2+ for both NPs converge while the fraction of Co3+ is significantly higher for Co in the Co NPs than in the CoPt NPs. When pressure is decreased from the highest point to millitorr, fractions of Co3+ in both CoPt and Co are reversible, that is, drop to zero when O2 partial pressure drops below 4.8 Torr; the fraction of Co0 and Co2+ in the CoPt NPs are partially reversible (hysteresis) while the fraction of Co0 and Co2+ in the Co NPs are the least reversible.

                "The hysteresis phenomena in regard to the oxidation state change of Co as. function of O2 partial pressure cycling may be explained similarly by the slow diffusion rate of oxygen from the surface to the subsurface. Basically, the diffusion of oxygen from the surface to subsurface is very slow so that even though there is no change from the X-ray absorption spectra the final equilibrium may not arrive in regard to the oxygen diffusion. Since during the increase and decrease of the O2 partial pressure the oxygen keeps diffusing into the NPs, Co will be in. more oxidized state when O2 partial pressure is decreasing than while it is increasing. On the other hand, once the pressure of oxygen is changed, significant change of Co oxidation state is observed and usually does not change after 20−50 min. This represents an intrinsic steady state that is formed under the oxygen, Co NPs and their interface. Each spectrum shown under the new pressure corresponds to. quasi-equilibrium state while the slow diffusion of oxygen may cause the hysteresis. Other studies (and reference therein) also suggested that hysteresis was connected with stress−strain energy associated with lattice expansion-contraction, resulting in generation-annihilation of dislocation networks, especially for small particles."

In our study, oxidation state stabilized relatively fast at each O2 partial pressure for both Co and CoPt NPs at 125 °C. Figure. shows that Pt enhances the oxidation resistance of Co at the elevated partial O2 pressure. The theory of metal oxidation and alloy effect on the metal oxidation resistance was developed long ago. Basically, for many metals in the thin film region the oxidation rate is controlled by the diffusion of metal ions to the surface as well as the electron tunneling to the surface. To apply the metal oxidation theory to our system, the possible mechanism that Pt enhanced the oxidation resistance of Co could be (1) the formation of PtO2 (XPS data shows top layer Pt is oxidized) at the surface may slow down the electron tunneling rate thus slow down the oxidation of Co; (2) at the phase boundary of Pt oxide and Co oxide, metal ion diffusion or electron tunneling may slow down due to the sudden electronic potential change; and (3) alloying with Pt may generate more free electrons at the metal−oxide interface. If that is the case, according to Wagner-Hauffe rule, these extra electrons will increase the concentration of interstitial Co vacancies, thus decrease the Co ion concentration. Since the oxidation rate is determined by the metal ion diffusion, the decrease of the Co ion concentration will decrease the oxidation rate of Co."

Depending on the system, oxidation of surface can either lead to an active or inactive phase of the catalyst. It is relevant to investigate the factors that may affect the ease or resistance of oxide formation, in this case the alloy effect. During the reaction, the surface is under the adsorption and desorption processes and is in equilibrium with the gas phase. K. Reuter et al. showed that the surface free energy is dependent only on the gas phase chemical potential. By relating the gas phase chemical potential to the total energy that was obtainable from the density functional theory (DFT) calculation,. surface phase diagram of stable and metastable structures of RuO2 in the chemical potential space was presented. Surface phase boundary was shown to span from UHV to more than one atmosphere pressure, where strong kinetic effect may lead to high catalytic activity. Also surface X-ray diffraction (SXRD) and first-principle calculations were performed to demonstrate that at the different oxygen partial pressure the metal presented different oxidized phases, where the experiment also showed. kinetic hindrance during the oxidation of Pd(100) that was not able to be revealed by the DFT calculation. Thus the feedback between the experiment and the DFT calculation complete each other and lead to the correct description of the system. Specifically, the experimental exploration of the chemical state phase diagram as. function of chemical potential or pressure would aid the DFT calculations under the H2 and O2 gas environments. Overall investigating the catalyst oxidation state in situ is important because the gas phase chemical reactivity plays. dominant role in deciding the stable oxidation states."
