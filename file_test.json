                "A screen-printed electrode (SPE) modified with poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) for electrochemical detection of NADH is described. FT-IR spectrum confirms the presence of a positively charged PAH SPE that was exploited to accumulate the NADH on the electrode surface for a faster electrochemical detection of this analyte. A wide response range was achieved in amperometry, at an applied potential of +0.6V, from 0.01 to 5mM, with a detection limit of 0.22μM. Differential pulse voltammetry allowed selective detection of NADH in presence of ascorbic acid. This approach provides a simple and effective way to detect low amounts of NADH with potential application in dehydrogenase-based biosensors."

                "In the last two decades the polymers have gained increasing importance in the development of electrochemical sensors and biosensors due to the fact that they are flexible materials that can be tailored for different needs. The literature reveals that polymers are mainly used as a coating material or as an immobilization matrix for some bio-molecules. Among the different type of polymers, the non-conducting one allow the immobilization of different biological components by encapsulation, cross-linking, or inclusion in their supramolecular structure. On the other hand the conducting polymers and the polyelectrolytes were extensively used, alone or in combination with other materials such as carbon nanotubes, nanofibers, graphene or metal nanoparticles in order to improve the performances of the electrochemical transducers. Electropolymerization is a very simple and attractive approach for the controlled immobilization of enzymes on electrode surfaces. Polyaniline, polypyrrole and polythiophene are the most known conducting polymers used for immobilization of horseradish peroxidase or different oxidases for detection of hydrogen peroxide, glucose, cholesterol, lactate, glutamate , , , ,. The binding forces involved are electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals forces, etc. Such an approach leaded to an increase of five times the current response for immobilization of GOD in polypyrrole. The main drawback of this method is the high amount of enzyme required for the immobilization process and the impossibility to calculate the exact amount of immobilized enzymes on the electrode surface. The polyelectrolytes are polymers obtained from monomers that have attached on the molecule polar groups. The polymers chain contains charged groups of the same sign. The polyelectrolytes can be strong (constant charge) or weak (with pH-dependent charge) depending on the pKa of charged groups. They are suitable for developing films that in aqueous media could have positive or negative charges, layer-by-layer (LBL) materials, with potential application in sensing. Positively charges polyelectrolytes such as, poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA), poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) or negatively charged polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), poly acrylic acid (PAA) are the common used for sensors and biosensor development. One of the advantages of polyelectrolyte films is the elimination of the interferences that could reach the electrode surface if the interfering species have opposite charge to that of the analyte. Nafion polyelectrolyte membrane used for immobilization of biomolecules by simple casting on the working electrodes, leads toward improved sensors in term of selectivity because it is negatively charged and has ion-exchange properties. However, these sensors present a slow response and a low sensitivity, due the low diffusion of the analytes through the film.",
                "The polyelectrolyte layer ensures a high active area and the electrostatic interaction between analyte and polymer could facilitate its accumulation at the electrode surface, resulting in the enhancement of analytical signal.",
                "Different composite materials based on polymers and other conductive materials (carbon nanotubes, metal nanoparticles) were also used to increase the electroactive surface of the electrode for a fast electron transfer to the electrode surface , , ,. Mediators could also be entrapped into the polymer structure facilitating the electron transfer between the analyte and electrode surface.",
                "There are not so many reports about systems based on dehydrogenases that use polyelectrolytes ,. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form (NADH) and its oxidized form (NAD+) play an important role in the living organism for functioning of more than 300 NAD-dependent enzymes. Usually the compound that is electrochemically detected by dehydrogenase based electrochemical biosensors is the NADH. However, the direct oxidation of NADH at bare classical electrodes occurs at a high overpotential and is affected by several electrochemical interferences. Moreover, a low sensitivity of these sensors was achieved and fouling of the electrode surface should be overcome. Various redox mediators and , conducting polymers , carbon nanotubes, graphene nanomaterials or nano-composite materials , ionic-liquid based materials , and were used to modify the electrode surface in order to increase the rate of the electron transfer. Despite the fact the chemical modification of the electrode leads to a decrease of the applied potential and an increase of the sensitivity, the sensors exhibited a limited stability because of the mediator leakage , a narrow linear range and do not eliminate completely the interferences. Also, the analytical applications of such NADH sensors are limited.",
                "In the present work, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time is reported a simple and effective way to detect NADH using poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) modify carbon screen-printed electrodes (SPE). The electrostatic interaction between positively charged polyelectrolyte and NADH facilitates the accumulation of the analyte at the surface of the modified electrode and lead to an enhancement of the oxidation current for the NADH."

No oxidation peak was observed for both types of electrode in the absence of NADH. The CV response of bare SPE and PAH/SPE electrodes shows the oxidation peak of NADH +550mV (Fig. 2A). The increase of the oxidation current from 4μA for bare electrode to 56μA in the presence of the polyelectrolyte layer suggests a faster oxidation process at the electrode surface for the last one. This phenomenon could be attributed to the electrostatic attraction between the polymer layer, which is positively charged and NADH molecules, negatively charged. This leads to an accumulation of the analyte on the electrode surface and to an enhancement of the oxidation current of the NADH.",

A linear relationship could be established between the peak current (ip) and the square root of the scan rate (v1/2). Nicholson–Shain criteria state that this is an indication that the electrochemical process is controlled by the diffusion of the NADH. Despite the fact that the Randles–Sevcik plot is linear the non-zero intercept of the equation suggests that the process is not fully diffusion-controlled. The intercept is more or less of the same order of magnitude with the smallest Faradaic current recorded and the diffusion controlled oxidation process could not be considered dominating. This may be due to the presence of the electrostatic interaction between PAH layer and the analyte that could play an important role and affect the electrochemical process. A shift of the peak potential to more positive values was also observed.",

In order to study this effect the same volume of PAH solution of different concentration was deposited on the surface of working electrode and left to dry according to the procedure described in Section 2.2. The SPE sensors were tested by cyclic voltammetry and the peak currents for NADH 5mM were compared. The highest current was recorded for a PAH concentration of 0.5mg/mL. At lower concentrations of PAH a very low response and unstable polyelectrolyte films were obtained. For higher concentrations of PAH the signal was lower due to the increase of the polymer film thickness that make the diffusion inside the film to be limitative for the sensor response. The optimal concentration of PAH was considered to be 0.5mg/mL and it was used for all further experiments. The thickness of the polyelectrolyte film is important for further development of dehydrogenase-based biosensors where the diffusion of the coenzyme through the film has an impact on the response time as well as on the sensitivity of the detection."

The variation of the pH value will modify the electrical charges of both polyelectrolyte film and analyte and thus will affect the electrostatic interaction between the polyelectrolyte and NADH. Therefore, the PAH deposition was realized from solution prepared in distilled water. No buffer solution was used for preparation of PAH solution because the presence of salts could have a negative impact to the adherence of the film to the electrode surface. In order to study the pH effect on the NADH sensor response, solutions of 5mM NADH with different pH were tested by CV. The results reveal a maximum oxidation current recorded for pH=6 and a minimum current for pH=8 (data not shown). The minimum value of the current could be explained by taking into account the pKa of PAH, which is reported in the literature to be between 8.0 and 8.7. At this pH the PAH layer is not electrically charged anymore. The accumulation of the NADH at the electrode surface cannot occur because there are no electrostatic interactions between PAH and NADH."

Two redox couples, one negatively charged Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64− and another one positively charged [Ru(NH3)6]2+/[Ru(NH3)6]3+ were considered. Fig. 3 shows the Nyquist plots for bare and PAH modified SPE electrodes. The Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64− plot for PAH/SPE (Fig. 3A) presents a semicircular portion followed at lower frequencies by a linear part, characteristic to a diffusion of redox species. The Randles model circuit based on the solution resistance (Rs), the charge transfer resistance (Rct), the constant phase element (CPE) and the Warburg impedance (ZW) was chosen to fit the impedance data and it is presented as inset in Fig. 3A. A fast electron transfer was observed for PAH/SPE with a value of the resistance of the electron transfer of 19.2±3.2Ω while the bare SPE showed a much slower electron transfer (Rct=705±97Ω). Lower resistance for PAH modified electrode could be attributed to the electrostatic interaction between PAH and Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64−. The presence of electrostatic interaction between the electrode surface and redox couple leads further to an electrochemical reaction and affect the double layer capacitance. It is more appropriate to consider a CPE in the equivalent circuit than a capacitor.",

Only a linear part can be distinguished that suggest a diffusion process of the redox species. At lower frequencies the Warburg impedance increases in the case of PAH/SPE compared to unmodified SPE electrode because the redox species have to diffuse farther and the PAH layer acts as barrier for the positively charged species. That could be explained by an electrostatic repel between the electrode surface and the mediator molecules both positively charged. EIS results suggest that faster electron transfer could be achieved for negatively charged species. The polyelectrolyte film can be successfully used for electrochemical application for ionizable analytes with negative charge."
