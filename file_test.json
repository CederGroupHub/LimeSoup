                "We have studied Au(55 nm)@SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) on two low-index phases of gold and platinum single crystal electrodes in ClO4– and SO42– ion-containing electrolytes by both electrochemical methods and in-situ shell-isolated nanoparticle enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS). We showed the blocking of the electrode with surfactants originating from the synthesis of as-prepared SHINERS NPs. We introduce an efficient procedure to overcome this problem, which provides a fundamental platform for the application of SHINERS in surface electrochemistry and beyond. Our method is based on a hydrogen evolution treatment of the SHINERS-NP-modified single-crystal surfaces. The reliability of our preparation strategy is demonstrated in electrochemical SHINERS experiments on the potential-controlled adsorption and phase formation of pyridine on Au(hkl) and Pt(hkl). We obtained high-quality Raman spectra on these well-defined and structurally carefully characterized single-crystal surfaces. The analysis of the characteristic A1 vibrational modes revealed perfect agreement with the interpretation of single-crystal voltammetric and chronoamperometric experiments. Our study demonstrates that the SHINERS protocol developed in this work qualifies this Raman method as a pioneering approach with unique opportunities for in situ structure and reactivity studies at well-defined electrochemical solid/liquid interfaces."

                "Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy is a powerful spectroscopic technique to study molecular adsorption and mechanisms of electrochemical reactions at metal/electrolyte interfaces. The method was initially limited to rough and/or nanostructured surfaces of coinage metals and subsequently extended toward transition metals by exploiting various concepts of “borrowing” SERS activity. During the past decade, template and nanoparticle-based fabrication strategies led to various SERS-active plasmonic nanostructures of controlled size, shape and composition to approach single molecule sensitivity and to overcome the problem of ill-defined surface morphologies of roughened samples. Examples for applications at electrochemical solid/liquid interfaces are gold and silver nanoclusters, nanorods and template-based or nanosphere lithography.",
                "The extension of SERS to well-defined single-crystal metal/electrolyte interfaces was pioneered by Otto et al., who studied the adsorption of pyridine molecules on Cu(hkl) surfaces. Ikeda et al. and Cui et al. reported high quality, potential-dependent Raman spectra of aromatic thioles on gold single-crystal electrodes using gap-mode plasmon excitation in a sandwich structure Au(hkl)/organic monolayer/Au(55 nm) nanoparticles (NPs). A particular unique approach for expanding SERS to electrified single-crystal electrode/electrolyte interfaces, termed shell-isolated nanoparticle enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS), was developed by Tian et al. The principle of the method is based on the assembly of a sphere-plane gap mode system composed of gold or silver NPs surrounded by a chemically inert, ultrathin and pinhole-free coating of SiO2 or Al2O3, dispersed on electrode surfaces, such as metals, oxides or silicon. The NPs act as plasmonic antennas and provide the electromagnetic enhancement of Raman scattering, while the SiO2 or Al2O3 shells prevent the core from interacting with the electrochemical system under study. Three-dimensional finite-difference-time-domain (3D FTDT) simulations demonstrated that most of the enhancement occurs between the SHINERS NPs and the substrate.",
                "The overall SHINERS signal is substantially greater than for tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), an alternative plasmon-based approach for Raman spectroscopy at single-crystal surfaces with potential for applications in an electrochemical environment. The latter is based on a single TERS tip, while the laser in the former approach probes a significantly larger number of plasmonic antennas. SHINERS has been demonstrated to give high quality Raman spectra of adsorbates at various atomically flat surfaces, such as Au(hkl), Pt(hkl), Rh(hkl) and Cu(hkl). Examples include hydrogen on Pt(111) and Rh(111), CO on Pt(111), SCN– on Au(hkl), pyridine on Au(hkl) and Pt(hkl), viologen on Au(111), 2,2′-bipyridine on Au(hkl), benzotriazole on Cu(hkl) and two very recent studies of Au(111) surface oxidation in H2SO4 respective alkynes on Pt(111). These pioneering studies demonstrate convincingly the ability of SHINERS to obtain high-quality face-dependent Raman spectra of adsorbates at single-crystal surfaces. The method bears a great potential in exploring correlations between structure and reactivity as well as in monitoring intermediates and pathways for a wide range of fundamental and applied processes at electrochemical interfaces.",
                "However, the more general application of SHINERS in surface electrochemistry requires several important issues to be addressed. These include (1) the modeling of the spectroscopic response, the role of adsorbates and nearby solution species, (2) exploring SHINERS NPs as plasmonic antennas “only” and minimizing their role on the spatial occupation (blocking) of surface sites, (3) the chemical inertness of the NP-shell as well as (4) their effect on the potential distribution at the modified electrode/electrolyte interface. The preparation of chemically inert and “clean” single-crystal surfaces modified with SHINERS NPs for subsequent structure and reactivity studies is rather difficult. Reagents used in the synthesis of the NPs may interfere severely with Raman signals of adsorbates under investigation. Attempts to improve the inertness of NPs involve iodine displacement, chemical polishing with cyanide, ozone cleaning, argon ion sputtering or the deposition of ligand-free NPs on suitable substrates in a vacuum. However, none of these methods are applicable to single-crystal surfaces modified with SHINERS NPs because of surface roughening and damaging of the isolation shell.",
                "In this paper we explore the influence of submonolayer coverages of Au(55 nm)@SiO2 (∼3 nm) NPs on the electrochemical response of low-index gold and platinum single-crystal electrodes (Figure 1A–C) in ClO4– and SO42– ion-containing electrolytes. We address the blocking of surface sites and introduce cathodic polarization as a unique strategy to prepare electrochemically rather inert NP-modified electrode surfaces. The quality of this preparation strategy is illustrated in electrochemical SHINERS experiments on the potential-controlled adsorption and phase formation of pyridine on Au(hkl) and Pt(hkl)."

                        "Figure 1D,E shows typical SEM and AFM images of a Au(111)-(1 × 1) surface modified with Au(55 nm)@SiO2 SHINERS NPs. The sample was prepared by drop-casting a dilute NP solution followed by gentle drying in a stream of argon and subsequent extended rinsing with Mill-Q water to dissolve unbound particles. Following this protocol, we obtained submonolayers of NPs with coverages ranging between 20 to 30%. Typically, the NPs are assembled in evenly distributed small islands containing from 4 up to 30 NPs. These islands are rather uniformly distributed on the substrate surface under our experimental conditions. The statistical analysis demonstrates that the islands contain typically 15–20 NPs (see Supporting Information for details). Isolated NPs or three-dimensional clusters are rarely observed after HER treatment.",
                        "Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) recorded in the double layer regions as well as upon extension to surface oxidation and reduction demonstrate a distinct influence of the SHINERS NPs on the electrochemical response. As an example, Figure 2 displays the corresponding data for Au(111) in 0.1 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M HClO4. The solid black lines represent the response of the unmodified, atomically flat Au(111) electrode, while the dotted blue curves are obtained in the presence of “as-prepared” SHINERS NPs following the procedure outlined in the literature and summarized briefly in the Methods section. The double layer currents and the oxidation/reduction pattern are strongly distorted. The characteristic features in the charging current representing the lifting and reformation of the surface reconstruction Au(111)-(p × √3) → Au(111)-(1 × 1) (P1/P1′), the adsorption of sulfate ions (P2/P2′) and the transition into the ordered (√3 × √7) sulfate phase (P3/P3′) are quenched for Au(111)/0.1 M H2SO4 in the presence of “as-deposited” NPs during both the anodic and the cathodic scans (Figure 2A). Extending the potential range up to 1.45 V demonstrates that the NPs diminish the Faraday charges representing the surface oxidation at step (P4) sites. The position of the reduction peak P5′ appears to be not influenced by the presence of the “as-prepared” SHINERS NPs (Figure 2A). However, the current magnitude is reduced. Inspection of the surface by AFM reveals that multiple cycling the potential in the double layer regions and upon oxidation/reduction does not modify the coverage of the SHINERS NPs.",
                        "Similar trends as for Au(111)/0.1 M H2SO4 were also observed in 0.1 M HClO4 (Figure 2B). The weaker specific adsorption of ClO4– anions, as compared to SO42–, leads to rather broad features for the lifting (P1) and reformation (P1′) of the surface reconstruction within the time scale of the voltammetric experiments. Oxide formation on terrace sites and the AuO place exchange take place on energetically different steps as represented by the occurrence of two current peaks labeled P5a and P5b. Their exact nature is still not clear.",
                        "In conclusion, we may state that the as-prepared SHINERS NPs influence the double layer and the oxidation/reduction response of Au(111) in H2SO4 and in HClO4 electrolytes severely. Possible reasons are blocking of surface sites or organic contaminants released from the NPs upon deposition and polarization.",
                        "In an attempt to overcome the undesired electrochemical response, we developed a protocol based on polarization in the hydrogen evolution range (HER) followed by sequences of electrolyte-exchange cycles. The Raman spectra were monitored simultaneously: An electrode (Au(hkl) or Pt(hkl)) modified with a submonolayer of SHINERS NPs was mounted in a three-electrode thin-layer cell (Au or Pt wires as counter electrodes, and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode) filled with deoxygenated neutral electrolyte, such as 0.1 M NaClO4. We typically used a spectro-electrochemical cell in a vertical configuration (Figure 3A). A thin electrolyte film was established by positioning the working electrode close to the optical quartz window (less than 50 μm). Next, the electrode was polarized at −2.00 V vs Ag/AgCl for 50–100 s. The HER proceeds vigorously. However, the thin layer geometry prevents the formation of big hydrogen bubbles, which keeps the submonolayer of NPs rather stable. This polarization procedure was repeated 3 to 4 times, accompanied by cycles of solution exchange to remove the desorbed impurities.",
                        "The efficiency of the procedure is illustrated in the sequence of Raman spectra displayed in Figure 3B. Trace a was recorded at 0.00 V in 0.1 M NaClO4 for Au(111) covered with 0.2 mL of Au(55 nm)@SiO2 NPs. We observed broad peaks at ∼1308, ∼1565 and ∼2883 cm–1, which are assigned to C–C, CC and C–H vibration modes of adsorbed organics. Polarization at −2.00 V leads to the desorption of these species as indicated by the absence of the three bands in the SHINERS trace b of Figure 3B. The feature at 1618 cm–1 corresponds to the bending mode of interfacial water. Electrolyte exchange and several repetitions of the polarization at −2.00 V resulted in Raman spectra without any impurity contribution as illustrated by trace c in Figure 3B. The spectrum was recorded at 0.00 V. Comparison with trace a demonstrates the efficiency of the HER-polarization and electrolyte exchange procedure. The SHINERS spectra plotted in Figure 3B are typical representations of properties of the entire NP-modified Au(111) surface. AFM inspection of the polarized Au(111) surface reveals a ∼5% decrease of the NP coverage and a slight increase of the island size (Figure 1F). Finally, we also like to emphasize that the HER in acidic electrolyte does not lead to the complete removal of organic adsorbates, as monitored by in situ Raman experiments.",
                        "Employing the HER-treated Au(111) electrode in voltammetric experiments in 0.1 M H2SO4 or 0.1 M HClO4 leads to curves (solid blue lines in Figure 2) that are almost identical to the response of the NP-free surface (black lines in Figure 2). The most pronounced difference is a 10% increase of the double layer charging current at E < E(P1), i.e., at a negatively charged surface, and a ca. 10% reduction of the charge consumed during lifting/reformation of the surface reconstruction (P1/P1′), as well as of the disorder/order phase transition within the sulfate adlayer (P3/P3′ in Figure 2A). Position and charge of the characteristic current peaks of surface oxidation (P4, P5) and reduction (P5′) appear to be unaltered in both electrolytes.",
                        "We also performed control experiments with NP-free Au(111) electrodes. The HER-treatment following a similar protocol as described above does not change the shape of the current–voltage response. The double layer responses and the characteristics in the gold surface oxidation/reduction regions are identical to the black traces in Figure 2."

                        "In an attempt to generalize the HER-treatment for preparing high-quality SHINERS-NP modified electrodes, we investigated next the electrochemical response of Au(100)-(1 × 1) electrodes in 0.1 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M HClO4 (Figure 4). The Au(100)-(hex) reconstruction was lifted prior to the electrochemical experiments following a previously described protocol, which gives rise to large, island-free terraces of several hundreds of nm2 with a nominal quadratic arrangement of the gold surface atoms. The coverage of the SHINERS NPs was estimated to approximately 20%. To eliminate possible interference with the potential-induced reformation of the Au(100)-(hex) surface reconstruction, all experiments started at 0.60 V. The black and blue solid traces, which represent the current vs potential response of the bare and of the cleaned NP-modified Au(100)-(1 × 1) electrodes, are basically identical in the double layer region as well as upon extension toward surface oxidation/reduction in both electrolytes. The voltammograms reveal signatures of nearly perfect, defect-free Au(100)-(1 × 1) electrodes in both electrolytes. P1, which is located at 0.34 V in H2SO4, and more positive at 0.57 V in HClO4, represents the charge contributions due to the lifting of a small fraction of potential-induced Au(100)-(hex) reconstructed patches (<5%).",
                        "The current response in the surface oxidation/reduction regions reveals the characteristic current peaks P4 and P5 representing surface oxidation at step and terrace sites as well as a single cathodic reduction peak P5′. The corresponding charges of 640 μC cm–2 (H2SO4) and 620 μC cm–2 (HClO4) decrease by less than 10% in the presence of the “cleaned” SHINERS NPs. AFM experiments demonstrated that the NP coverage is not changing during multiple oxidation/reduction cycles.",
                        "Finally, we notice in Figure 4 the distinct difference in the current response of Au(100)-(1 × 1) modified with HER-SHINERS (solid blue line) and “as-deposited” SHINERS NPs (dotted blue lines). This comparison illustrates the importance for establishing carefully designed and evaluated experimental protocols for SHINERS NPs on electrode surfaces to obtain meaningful electrochemical and Raman signatures on atomically smooth single-crystal electrode surfaces."

                        "Next we adopted the HER-based SHINERS-NP post-treatment to Pt(111) and Pt(100) electrodes. The Pt(hkl) bead electrodes, as prepared by flame-annealing and subsequent cooling in Ar/H2, revealed high quality voltammograms of low-defect surfaces (black lines in Figure 5), which agree with literature data. The data for Pt(111)/0.1 M H2SO4 show at E < 0.10 V, a clear signature P1/P1′ of hydrogen adsorption on terrace sites. The charge in −0.20 V ≤ E ≤ 0.10 V is estimated to 160 μC cm–2. The additional small peaks at −0.13 and 0.02 V represent hydrogen adsorption on (110) and (100) step sites. P2/P2′ at E > 0.10 V represents a disordered adlayer of sulfate anions, which undergoes a disorder/order phase transition at P3/P3′. The height and the shape of this pair of current peaks is a measure of the long-range order and cleanliness of the Pt(111) terrace sites. P4/P4′ at more positive potentials is assigned to a structure transition within the ordered sulfate layer. The voltammogram of a cleaned Pt(111) electrode modified with a submonolayer of SHINERS NPs reproduces nearly all features of the bare Pt(111) electrode in 0.1 M H2SO4. A comparison of the solid blue and black traces in Figure 5 reveals only a decrease of the charge consumed in P3/P3′ (<30%). On the other hand, experiments with “as prepared” SHINERS NPs lead to a significant depression of hydrogen adsorption until the onset of hydrogen evolution at E < −0.20 V, as well as to the blocking of sulfate and hydroxide adsorption at more positive potentials, which is indicated by the dotted blue line in Figure 5A.",
                        "Similar trends were observed for Pt(111) in 0.1 M HClO4 (Figure 5B). The HER-SHINERS NPs do not alter the voltammogram for hydrogen adsorption (P1/P1′) and in the double layer charging region until E ≤ 0.30 V. The charge consumed in −0.20 V ≤ E ≤ 0.10 V is estimated to 160 μC cm–2. However, the so-called Butterfly peak P4/P4′ at E > 0.30 V, which is assigned to the reversible OH-adsorption, decreases moderately in the presence of SHINERS NPs. The current response of the NP-modified Pt(111) electrodes without treatment by HER reveals the complete blocking of this region and a significant reduction of available (111) terrace sites in the potential region of hydrogen adsorption (dotted blue line in Figure 5B).",
                        "The situation is more complex for Pt(100)-(1 × 1) in 0.1 M H2SO4 and in 0.1 M HClO4. The voltammogram of Pt(100)-(1 × 1) in 0.1 M H2SO4 (black line in Figure 5C) shows two characteristic current peaks labeled P1/P1′ at E = 0.05 V and P2/P2′ at E = 0.13 V. The latter is assigned to the adsorption/desorption of hydrogen and sulfate ions on (100) terrace sites, and the former to that on (111) step and/or step-edge sites. The total charge consumed in −0.10 V ≤ E ≤ 0.50 V amounts to (220 ± 10) μC cm–2. STM measurements demonstrated that Pt(100) electrodes, cooled down after flame-annealing in an Ar/H2 atmosphere, are unreconstructed and composed of long and wide terraces, which alternate with step-bunched regions. On terraces wider than 500 nm, we also observed square-shaped Pt ad-islands of 0.21 nm height and 10 to 40 nm in x–y dimensions. This higher defect density, as compared to Pt(111)-(1 × 1), might explain why the HER-treatment of SHINERS-NP-modified Pt(100) electrodes is less effective. The solid blue line in Figure 5C reveals an increase of the number of (111) defect sites of type P1/P1′ and a significant reduction of accessible (100) terrace sites for hydrogen/sulfate adsorption respective desorption in the presence of SHINERS NPs. The total charge consumed in the double layer region is reduced by ∼15% with respect to the NP-free surface. However, the effect is still rather small as compared to the current response of an electrode, which was not exposed to HER conditioning. The dotted blue line in Figure 5C shows that all characteristic features of an ideal Pt(100)-(1 × 1) electrode in H2SO4 are blocked completely.",
                        "The voltammogram of a bare Pt(100)-(1 × 1) electrode in 0.1 M HClO4 displays a broad current feature between −0.10 to 0.25 V, which is composed of at least two current peaks labeled P1/P1′ and P2/P2′. This potential region is assigned to hydrogen ad/desorption. The broad peak P4/P4′ in 0.25 V ≤ E ≤ 0.45 V is related to OH-adsorption. The charge consumed in −0.10 V ≤ E ≤ 0.50 V is estimated as q = 250 μC cm–2. We observed a reduction of the charging current in the hydrogen- and OH-adsorption regions for a Pt(100) electrode modified with SHINERS NPs, even after extended conditioning in the potential region of HER (blue line in Figure 5D). The total charge in both potential regions decreases by ca. 30%. The current response of Pt(100)-(1 × 1) in 0.1 M HClO4 with “as-deposited” SHINERS NPs is similar to observations in 0.1 M H2SO4 (dotted blue lines in Figure 5C,D).

Pyridine qualifies as an ideal compound for model studies on adsorption, orientation and surface coordination of molecules at electrified solid/liquid interfaces. Pyridine was the first molecule used in demonstrating the SERS effect and has been an important probe molecule thereafter to test SERS activity and surface properties of SERS substrates. However, most of these studies were carried out on roughened or colloidal surfaces and interfaces. Only very few papers report data on atomically flat, truly single-crystalline surfaces. The approaches chosen use either an attenuated total reflection configuration (ATR) or SHINERS NPs as plasmonic antennas, as illustrated in our recent preliminary communication.",
                        "Figure 6A shows typical voltammograms of a bare (black line) and a HER-SHINERS-NP-modified Au(111) electrode in 1 mM pyridine/0.1 M NaClO4. The current response of the NP-free gold electrode reveals three characteristic pairs of peaks P1/P1′, P2/P2′ and P3/P3′. P1/P1′ is assigned to the ad/desorption of pyridine with the π-system oriented flat on a negatively charged electrode surface. The coverage increases at more positive potentials, and a certain fraction appears to assume a tilted N-coordinated orientation at defect sites. This process is proposed to start around P2/P2′. Chronocoulometric measurements by Lipkowski et al. suggest that a maximum coverage of 1.4 × 10–10 mol cm–2 is reached. Next, and close to the potential of zero charge of the pyridine-covered Au(111) surface (Epzc ≈ 0.13 V) an adlayer structure transition from planar to N-coordinated vertically standing molecules takes place. This process is marked by the current peak P3/P3′ and leads to a π-stacked assembly of pyridine molecules on a positively charged electrode at E > P3/P3′ with Γ = 6.7 × 10–10 mol cm–2. We note that within the transition region marked by P3/P3′ a certain tilted orientation with a rather small tilt angle referring to the surface normal forms a stable intermediate adlayer, as indicated by the sharp current spikes in 0.10 V ≤ E ≤ 0.20 V in Figure 6A.",
                        "The voltammogram of the NP-modified Au(111) electrode (solid blue line in Figure 6A) reproduces the current profile of pyridine adsorption in the double layer region in −0.70 V ≤ E ≤ 0.05 V and in 0.20 V ≤ E ≤ 0.40 V. The charge involved in the structure transition region around P3/P3′ is reduced by ca. 30%, and the sharp current spikes are not resolved. Most probably, the SHINERS NPs act as local defects on the electrode surface preventing the formation of a long-range, two-dimensionally ordered adlayer and the phase transition accompanied with it.",
                        "The simultaneously recorded SHINERS spectra of pyridine adsorbed on Au(111) are plotted in Figure 6C. Data acquisition started at 0.40 V. We observed four pyridine-related bands, which are assigned to the following A1 modes: 1009–1012 cm–1 (ν1, ring breathing), 1033–1035 cm–1 (ν12, symmetric trigonal ring breathing), 1207–1209 cm–1 (ν9a, C–H deformation) and 1593–1597 cm–1 (ν8a, ring stretching). The band at 933 cm–1, marked by “*” in Figure 6C, is attributed to coadsorbed perchlorate ions. The pyridine modes are blue-shifted with respect to those in neat pyridine solution. The frequency of the ring breathing mode ν1 is particularly sensitive to potential-dependent structure changes of the pyridine adlayer including electrostatic effects, σ-donation and π-back-donation etc. Figure 6E,F displays the potential dependence of integrated intensity and peak position of the ν1 mode. We note that the Raman spectra plotted in Figure 6 are typical data of the HER-SHINERS NPs modified surfaces. Our preparation procedure guarantees a rather uniform size distribution of islands containing 15–20 NPs (see Supporting Information for a characteristic histogram), which can be identified and localized with the help of the CCD-camera of the spectrometer. Typically, we recorded the SHINERS intensity of up to 20 distinct island sites. Employing our preparation procedure of submonolayer HER-SHINERS NPs, we observed a variation in intensity of less than 15%.",
                        "We also notice that the SHINERS signal is dominated by contributions from the NP/substrate interface (see FDTD simulations in ref ), where the pyridine adlayer is well established on unperturbed terrace sites. In consequence, one should expect a strong correlation between the spectroscopic data and other surface electrochemical studies, such as chronocoulometry and cyclic voltammetry. And indeed, the following characteristics were obtained (Figure 6): The ν1 mode appears with the onset of pyridine adsorption at E ≥ −0.60 V and grows until −0.40 V, where a first plateau is reached. The corresponding region in the voltammogram is marked by the peaks P1/P1′ and P2/P2′. The peak position varies in this potential region less than 1 cm–1, which points to a slight deviation from a fully planar orientation of the π-system. This interpretation agrees with conclusions from IR-spectroscopy. An additional increase in intensity is observed at E ≥ 0.10 V, simultaneously with the appearance of the current peak P3/P3′ in the voltammogram. The signal seems to level off at E ≥ 0.40 V. δν1δE is estimated to 6 cm–1V. This value of the Stark shift is rather typical for molecular adsorption at electrochemical interfaces with a dipole contribution aligned perpendicularly to the electrode surface. All four pyridine-related A1 modes scale similarly in their potential dependence of peak intensities and wave numbers.",
                        "The above SHINERS data demonstrate unambiguously that pyridine is adsorbed already at a negatively charged Au(111) surface in a none-parallel, most probably slightly tilted orientation with respect to the plane surface, and reorients into a fully upright orientation upon pathing the potential of zero charge at E > 0.10 V. Possible complications of this behavior due to reformation of the reconstructed Au(111)-(p × √3) surface or gold island formation upon the subsequent lifting of the reconstruction (see Methods section for details) should be of rather little influence since (1) all experiments started with a fully unreconstructed surface at positive potentials and (2) pyridine blocks drastically the potential-induced surface reconstruction, even at rather negative potentials.",
                        "Similar spectro-electrochemical properties were also observed with pyridine on Au(100)-(1 × 1) modified with HER-SHINERS NPs (Figure 6B,D–F). The voltammogramms in the absence (solid black line) and in the presence (solid blue line) of NPs coincide in the double layer region in −0.70 V ≤ E ≤ −0.30 V and in 0.10 V ≤ E ≤ 0.40 V. Chronocoulometric experiments revealed that the pyridine coverage increases from 0 to ca. 3.0 × 10–10 mol cm–2 gradually in −0.60 V ≤ E ≤ E(P3), and reaches its saturation value 6.0 × 10–10 mol cm–2 at E > E(P3) in a step-like manner. This coverage is attributed to pyridine molecules adsorbed in a vertical orientation with the nitrogen atom facing the positively charged Au(100)-(1 × 1) surface. Pyridine adsorption seems to facilitate structure changes of the Au(100) surface, such as the reformation of the Au(100)-(hex) reconstruction at sufficiently negative potentials and its lifting toward the Au(100)-(1 × 1) geometry around 0.0 V upon crossing the potential of zero charge (Epzc = −0.05 V), which coincides with the position of P3. The current peak P3 contains charge contribution from both, the reorientation of adsorbed pyridine as well as of the restructuring of the electrode surface.",
                        "This complex behavior is also reflected in the voltammogram with HER-SHINERS NPs (Figure 6B). The current peak P3 is reduced by 52% (blue line) as compared to the bare (black line) Au(100) surface. The cathodic counter feature P3′ around −0.20 V is quenched. The corresponding SHINERS spectra, as recorded from 0.40 V toward more negative potentials, are displayed in Figure 6D. Qualitatively, we observed the same pyridine-related bands as for Au(111). Figure 6E,F displays, as a representative example, the potential-dependencies of integrated band intensity and position of the symmetric ν1 breathing mode. Similar to trends for pyridine on Au(111), the Raman intensity increases from the onset of pyridine adsorption at E ≥ −0.60 V up to a plateau in −0.40 V ≤ E ≤ −0.10 V, and subsequently raises further in the transition region P3/P3′ until saturation at E ≥ 0.30 V. The position of the ν1-mode changes gradually with potential in −0.60 V ≤ E ≤ −0.10 V with δνδE ≈ 1 cm–1V and at E > −0.10 V with δνδE ≈ 6 cm–1V. The latter Stark shift is the same as for pyridine/Au(111) at a positively charged electrode. The detection of the ν1 mode as well as the other pyridine-related modes at E < Epzc and their evolution in dependence on the applied potential demonstrate that pyridine is adsorbed on the negatively charged Au(100) surface in a tilted orientation with the nitrogen atom directed toward the surface and undergoes a structure transition in a N-coordinated vertical adsorption geometry at E > E(P3), where the electrode surface bears a positive charge. The data in Figure 6E,F also demonstrate that this transition occurs at more negative potentials on Au(100)-(1 × 1) as compared to Au(111)-(1 × 1). This trend correlates with the more negative value of Epzc of the former.",
                        "Finally, we comment on the higher integrated intensity of the pyridine-related Raman bands on Au(100). We have shown in a previous communication, on the basis of periodic DFT calculations and a theoretical analysis of the dielectric functions, that the facet-dependence is predominantly governed by the dielectric properties of the surface. The much smaller imaginary part of the dielectric function for the (110) plane as compared to the other low-index planes leads to a higher electroreflectance and a much stronger electromagnetic field.",
                        "Pyridine adsorption on Pt(111)-(1 × 1) and Pt(100)-(1 × 1) in 0.1 M NaClO4 appears to be less complex as compared to the two gold single-crystal surfaces described above. The voltammograms are displayed in Figure 7A,B. They illustrate that pyridine adsorption starts at potentials E ≥ −0.70 V, slightly more negative than the onset of hydrogen adsorption and the position of P1. P1 is thought to represent the adsorption of neutral pyridine, while features at more negative potentials are attributed tentatively to the protonated form. The pyridine adlayer blocks the adsorption of hydrogen and perchlorate ions, which corroborates with a low double layer charging current (or capacitance) in −0.20 V ≤ E ≤ 0.30 V. The latter assumes smaller values on Pt(111), which reflects the atomically somewhat larger roughness of the unreconstructed Pt(100)-(1 × 1) surface, as obtained after flame annealing and cooling in an Ar/H2 atmosphere. The voltammograms of pyridine on Pt(111) and Pt(100) in the absence and in the presence of HER-SHINERS NPs superimpose.",
                        "The corresponding HER-SHINERS spectra are shown in Figure 7C,D. In addition to the four A1-modes of pyridine, a fifth band occurs at 1064–1066 cm–1, which is attributed to the C–H deformation A1-mode ν18a. All A1 modes reveal a similar behavior with increasing electrode potential. Figure 7E,F demonstrates the trend for ν1. The integrated intensities increase steeply at E = −0.60 V and reach a plateau at E ≥ −0.40 V. The latter decreases slightly at E ≥ 0.20 V, which is attributed to the onset of competitive adsorption of OH-species. Simultaneously, δν1δE increases from 1 cm–1V at −0.40 V up to 7 cm–1V at E > 0.00 V for both electrodes. These characteristic vibration signatures are interpreted as gradual transfer from an N-coordinated tilted adsorption geometry of pyridine at E < −0.40 V to a vertical orientation at E ≥ −0.40 V. This interpretation is in agreement with conclusions from UHV-transfer experiments at controlled potential and a subsequent analysis of the pyridine adlayer on Pt(111) by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).",
                        "Similar as for pyridine on the two gold facets investigated, the SHINERS signal on Pt(100) is larger as compared to that on Pt(111). This trend is also supported by the different dielectric properties of the two crystallographic orientations."

We demonstrated that Au(hkl) and Pt(hkl) surfaces modified with a submonolayer (and more!) of “as-prepared” SHINERS nanoparticles show distorted voltammetric and spectroscopic responses (see Supporting Information). The electrode surfaces are blocked with surfactants originating from the synthesis of the Au(55 nm)@SiO2 nanoparticles, which give rise to additional current and spectroscopic features, and therefore cause artifacts in data interpretation and assignment.",
                "We developed an efficient strategy to overcome this problem. Our approach is based on the treatment of surfaces modified with SHINERS NPs in the potential region of hydrogen evolution in 0.1 M aqueous NaClO4. Case studies with Me(111)-(1 × 1) and Me(100)-(1 × 1), Me = Au, Pt, demonstrate the efficiency of our method. Voltammetric experiments in 0.1 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M HClO4 reveal that all characteristic double layer features of Au(111) and Au(100) electrodes in contact with these electrolytes coincide in the absence as well as in the presence of the HER-SHINERS NPs. Rather good agreement was also obtained with Pt(111)-(1 × 1) electrodes in both electrolytes. In case of Pt(100)-(1 × 1), qualitative agreement is reached; however, the hydrogen and anion adsorption regions are slightly blocked by the presence of the HER-SHINERS NPs, even after extended cycles of HER treatment. Application studies with these electrodes require some caution and careful control experiments.",
                "Pyridine adsorption and phase formation on Me(111)-(1 × 1) and Me(100)-(1 × 1), Me = Au, Pt, were chosen as a case study to demonstrate the potential of HER-SHINERS for in situ investigations of nanoscale phenomena and processes at electrified solid/liquid interfaces. We obtained high-quality Raman spectra on these well-defined and structurally carefully characterized Au(hkl) and Pt(hkl) single-crystal surfaces. The analysis of the characteristic A1 vibrational modes revealed perfect agreement with the interpretation of single-crystal voltammetric and chronoamperometric experiments. Our study demonstrates convincingly that the SHINERS protocol as developed in this study qualifies this unique Raman method as a highly promising approach for in situ structure and reactivity studies at well-defined electrochemical solid/liquid interfaces. The study also reveals the need of combining the spectro-electrochemical investigations with morphology studies of the respective substrate surface and control experiments on the inertness of the plasmonic nanoparticles with respect to the process under investigation."

Next, a 27 M% sodium silicate solution was diluted to 0.54 M% (∼90.0 mM) and adjusted to pH ∼10.3 with hydrochloric acid. 3.2 mL of the diluted and acidified sodium silicate solution were then added to the reaction mixture, which was stirred afterward at room temperature for 3 more min. The solution was then transferred to a 90 °C bath and stirred for a certain period of time. The shell thickness could be tuned from a few nanometers to tens of nanometers by controlling the reaction time. For example, 30 min or 1 h of heating time resulted in coating the gold core with a layer of about 3 or 5 nm thickness, respectively. In this paper, we controlled the reaction time to 30 min, which leads to a silica shell thickness of ∼3 nm (see Figure 1A). The shell is pinhole-free and provides a sufficiently strong enhancement of the pyridine-related Raman signals. Electrochemical and Raman experiments were carried out to ensure that the as-prepared SHINERS NPs are free of pinholes. The test protocols were described in our previous papers.",

The concentrated SHINERS NPs at the bottom of the test tube were diluted and centrifuged again. This procedure was repeated several times. The cleaned Au@SiO2 NPs were dissolved in 200 μL of Milli-Q water, which leads to a solution containing ∼1.97 mM total gold. Two microliters of this solution were then casted onto a freshly prepared Au(hkl) or Pt(hkl) single-crystal bead electrode (Figure 1B) and subsequently dried in a gentle stream of argon. The SHINERS NPs form a submonolayer of small, statistically distributed two-dimensional islands, which contain typically 15–20 NPs. The NP-coverage as obtained from SEM and AFM measurements (Figure 1) is estimated to range between 20 to 30%. We note that the silicon shell prevents the formation of three-dimensional aggregates."
