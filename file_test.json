                "The structural properties of melamine-uric acid complexes (which are responsible for kidney stones) with compositional variations are examined using a series of classical molecular dynamics simulations. The preferential interaction parameters imply that melamine interacts more strongly with uric acid than with other melamine molecules present in the system, whereas uric acid preferentially interacts with other uric acid molecules rather than with melamine. The stronger interactions among uric acid molecules produce higher-order uric acid clusters, which “drag” neighboring melamine molecules to be added to a cluster. Determination of orientational preferences between aromatic planes reveals that π–π stacking is responsible for uric acid self-association but less significant for melamine-melamine and melamine-uric acid accumulation. Cluster structure analyses suggest that higher concentrations of melamine, uric acid, or both result in a large insoluble melamine-uric acid complex cluster. Molecular mechanics-Poisson Boltzmann surface area calculations give a negative binding energy, indicating favorable complexation between melamine and uric acid molecules. Moreover, the overall complexation energy [ ΔG0(mel-mel) + ΔG0(uri-uri) + ΔG0(mel-uri) ] is more negative than ΔG0bind(mel-uri) . The lifetime of melamine dimers is quite low compared with those of uric acid-uric acid and melamine-uric acid dimers, resulting in a low percentage of larger clusters for melamine-melamine interaction and a significant percentage of higher-order melamine-uric acid and uric acid-uric acid clusters with longer lifetimes. Furthermore, melamine and uric acid form strong hydrogen bonds, and melamine-melamine interactions are dominated by hydrogen bonding, whereas uric acid forms only a small number of hydrogen bonds with other uric acid molecules."

                "Melamine ( Fig. 1 ), an organic compound containing a high percentage of nitrogen (66% by molecular weight), produces several stable hydrogen-bonded arrays with cyanuric acid and other related compounds. Melamine is safe when used normally but potentially dangerous when consumed in excess amounts, which can occur when foodstuffs are contaminated. There have been cases of illegal use of melamine to adulterate foods in order to falsely elevate the nitrogen content of the constituent proteins, mainly in baby foods. As a result, various food safety incidents have taken place worldwide, including the formation of kidney stones in infants following the ingestion of melamine-contaminated foods. Analysis of these kidney stones showed that they were composed of melamine and uric acid ( Fig. 1 ). As well as the effects on the human body, evidence of melamine toxicity, including nephrolithiasis, chronic kidney infection, and bladder cancer, has been found in animals. The risk of kidney stone formation is increased when melamine is consumed daily.",
                "The [uric acid]:[melamine] molar ratio measured in kidney stones from infants has varied from 1:2 to 2.1:1, indicating that the composition of melamine-uric acid stones may vary. Anderson et al. first predicted the crystal structure of melamine-uric acid, showing that melamine and uric acid form hydrogen-bonded lattices. These lattices are thought to shape sheet like structures that are associated by stacking to give a three-dimensional structure held together by hydrogen bonding between the layers. The authors proposed that the hydrogel was composed of two distinct hydrogen-bonding adjustments of complementary donor-acceptor pairs when these are present in equimolar amounts in the body. Furthermore, the results of this study suggested that a 1:1 hydrogen-bonded interaction of the two components is responsible for stone formation. Later, in 2014, Asami et al. found that a 1:1 complex of uric acid and melamine acquires a non-planar structure in which the uric acid plane is slightly folded with respect to melamine and stabilized by multiple hydrogen bonds. In 2015, Chen et al. proposed that melamine binds more strongly to uric acid than to cyanuric acid. They studied these interactions through fluorescence quenching of solutions of various concentrations of melamine and uric acid, showing that both hydrogen bonding and π–π stacking are responsible for the tight binding in the complex.",
                "The interactions between melamine and uric acid to form kidney stones indicate that decreasing uric acid concentration in the kidney could help to prevent the formation of renal stones. As it has been shown that the formation of renal calculi occurs in supersaturated (resulting from excess dosage of melamine) urine but not in under-saturated urine, exposure to melamine in low concentrations could be a fruitful way to prevent renal calculi. Thus, the concentrations of both melamine and uric acid are important in discussions of melamine-uric acid-related renal calculi. The present study makes a contribution toward this end. Here, motivated by the clinical research described above, the interaction between melamine and uric acid is studied in a concentration-dependent manner. The purpose of this work was to determine the exact underlying mechanism by which the structural properties of melamine-uric acid complexes vary with composition under ambient temperature-pressure conditions; in particular, we addressed the previously unsolved question of whether melamine or uric acid helps to increase the excretion of the element of interest (either melamine or uric acid). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study to describe explicitly the mechanism of formation of kidney stones.",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we discuss the models of melamine, uric acid, and water molecules that are used in this study. Other simulation details are also described in this section. In Sec. III, the results are presented, together with discussion. In Sec. IV, our conclusions are briefly summarized."

                "In the present study, classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using different concentrations of melamine and uric acid in water. Representative systems are presented in Table I .",
                "First, the RESP (restrained electrostatic potential) suite of the AMBER12 package was used to obtain the partial charges of different atomic sites of melamine and uric acid molecules (after energy optimization using the ab initio HF/6-31+G** method with the help of Gaussian 09 ) ( Table II ). Next, general AMBER force field parameters were applied, using the built-in ANTECHAMBER module in AMBER12. For all systems, the three-point transferable intermolecular potential water model was chosen to perform the MD simulations. The starting configurations of all systems were constructed using PACKMOL. During the course of the simulations, a final temperature of 300 K was fixed for all systems. For each system, all molecules were incorporated in a cubic box. For each simulation, a 10 000-step energy minimization was carried out, of which 4000 steps were performed with the steepest descent method, followed by 6000 steps with the conjugate gradient method. All systems were slowly heated from 0 to 480 K in increments of 50 K for 20 ps, followed by gradual cooling to the final temperature with a decrement interval of 25 K in the canonical ensemble (NVT). Then, each system was subjected to 5 ns equilibration in an isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble at 300 K and 1 atm. Subsequently, simulations were subjected to a 200 ns production run in the NPT ensemble. The last 100 ns of each 200 ns production run were used for data analysis. Periodic boundary conditions were employed in all three directions. Langevin dynamics (with 1 ps−1 collision frequency) were used to maintain a temperature of 300 K during the simulation for all systems. To maintain the system at a pressure of 1 atm (in the NPT ensemble), the Berendsen barostat was used with a 2 ps pressure relaxation time. The particle mesh Ewald algorithm was used to treat long-range electrostatic interactions. The SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms. Short-range non-bonded interactions were defined using a 10 Å cut-off distance. MD simulation trajectories were analyzed using the CPPTRAJ module in AMBER. Visual Molecular Dynamics was used for visualization of the obtained MD simulation trajectories, including analysis of various properties when required.",
                "The last 20 ns of MD trajectories of all systems were taken to calculate binding free energy or complexation free energy ( Δ Gbind0 ) using the molecular mechanics-Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) methodology.",
                "The Python script MMPBSA.py in the AMBER package was used for all MM-PBSA calculations. The binding free energy, Δ Gbind0 , was estimated as follows: where ΔEvac corresponds to the energy in the vacuum (gas phase) and the solvation free energy is represented by ΔGsolv. ΔEvac can further be decomposed as where ΔEele and ΔEvdw refer to receptor-ligand electrostatic and van der Waals interactions, respectively. The solvation free energy (ΔGsolv) was calculated as the sum of the electrostatic solvation free energy (ΔGPB) and apolar solvation free energy (ΔGNP),",
                "ΔGPB was computed in a continuum solvent using the MM-PBSA package of AMBER. On the other hand, ΔGNP was determined from the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA). The SASA was calculated using MSMS for the estimation of ΔGNP as in Refs. , where γ = 0.005 kcal/Å2 and β = 0.0.",
                "In the present study, four systems (S0, S1, S2, and S3), with a [melamine]:[uric acid] of 1:1 but different concentrations, were initially prepared. Next, the uric acid concentration of system S0 was increased gradually. These systems were denoted P0 and P1. The melamine concentration of system S0 was also varied with a regular increment; the resulting systems were denoted P2 and P3. Two additional systems (N0 and N1) were prepared, in which the [melamine]:[uric acid] ratios were 2:3 and 3:2, respectively, in order to compare their outcomes with those of the other systems to validate the conclusions. System Su was prepared to determine the change in structural properties of uric acid in the presence of melamine compared with system S0. Systems P0–P3, N0, N1, and Su are briefly described in Table I ."

                        "The first shell coordination number (CN) is a measure of the number of molecules of a specific solute that accumulate around a reference solute in a system. In the present study, CN values were determined for melamine-uric acid, uric acid-uric acid, and melamine-melamine interactions using the respective pair distribution functions and the center of mass (COM) of a particular solute by the equation where CN is the number of atoms of type β around the atomic sites of type α in a shell extending from 0 to a separation rc ( Fig. 2 ). Here, ρβ represents the number density of β in the system. In Table III , for the systems, S0–S3, running coordination number values of melamine around a reference uric acid are presented. The CNs of melamine around a reference uric acid were 0.97, 2.14, 2.98, and 2.78 for systems S0, S1, S2, and S3, respectively. For systems P0 and P1, the CN values of melamine around uric acid were 1.51 and 1.21 respectively, and those for systems P2 and P3 were 2.28 and 3.61, respectively ( Table III ). On the other hand, for N0 and N1, the CN values were 1.89 and 3.40, respectively ( Table III ). As the concentration of melamine increased, the CN value of melamine around uric acid molecules also increased for systems S0–S3, P2, P3, and N1. Thus, the coordination number of melamine around a reference uric acid varied from 1 to 3. This result is supported by the CN values for systems S0, P0, and P1, which had the lowest concentrations of melamine, and also those for systems S3, P3, and N1, in which the maximum number of melamine molecules were present in addition to uric acid. Similarly, the CN values of uric acid around melamine were determined for all systems ( Table III ). The CN of uric acid around melamine differed in a similar way to that of the CN of melamine around uric acid for systems S0–S3 ( Table III ). For systems P0 and P1, the CN values of uric acid around reference melamine were 3.01 and 3.36, respectively, and those for systems P2 and P3 were 1.14 and 1.20, respectively ( Table III ). For N0 and N1, the CN values were 2.83 and 2.27, respectively ( Table III ). In this case, also, the CN of uric acid around the reference melamine varied from 1 to 3. Similarly, the CN of uric acid around uric acid ranged from 1.04 to 1.98 ( Table III ). These values (for uric acid around uric acid) can be understood in terms of their π-stacked structure (discussed below). The CN of melamine around melamine varied from 0.11 to a maximum value of 0.95 ( Table III ). These results indicate that in the presence of uric acid, melamine interacts more with uric acid than with other melamine molecules. Moreover, the comparison between systems S0 and Su reveals that the coordination number of uric acid around uric acid does not change notably in the presence of melamine. This suggests that melamine does not interfere with uric acid-uric acid interactions; rather, it binds to the aggregated uric acid molecules. Furthermore, the CN of water around melamine and uric acid ( Table IV ) was determined. Clearly, melamine accommodated more water around it than uric acid in all systems ( Table IV ). In particular, for systems S0 and Su, the CN values of water around a reference uric acid were 11.47 and 12.15, respectively ( Table IV ). The change in the CN value was due to complexation between melamine and uric acid in water for system S0, in contrast with Su, which contained uric acid in water only."

                        "In this section, spatial density distributions of various combinations—including the density of uric acid and melamine around reference uric acid, and density distributions of melamine and uric acid around a reference melamine—were determined. In Figs. 3(a)–3(d) , for all systems (S0–S3), the spatial distributions of solute uric acid and melamine density inside the solvation shell of a reference uric acid are shown. An isovalue of 2.0 Å was used. For the determination of density distribution, the last 20 ns of trajectory files were used. Moving continuously from system S0 to system S3 [ Figs. 3(a)–3(d) ], the enhanced density of uric acid molecules around a reference uric acid molecule can be observed. In addition, the spatial distribution of melamine also increased around a reference uric acid. It can be easily seen that the distribution of uric acid and melamine around a reference uric acid becomes more compact and symmetric when both molecules are present in a higher concentration in the system. In Figs. 3(e)–3(h) , the density of melamine and uric acid molecules around a reference melamine molecule is also presented. As shown in Fig. 3(e) , for system S0, the density of melamine around a reference melamine was initially negligible but became more prominent at higher melamine concentrations. Moreover, there was a persistent increment of uric acid distributions around the reference melamine from system S0 to system S3 [ Figs. 3(e)–3(h) ]. In this context, we classify the aggregation of melamine and uric acid molecules in terms of the compositional variation of one solute keeping the other one fixed. As shown in Figs. 4(a)–4(e) , the density distribution of uric acid and melamine around the reference uric acid increased when the concentration of one solute was kept fixed and the other continuously increased. This was also true for the density distributions of melamine and uric acid around a reference melamine [ Figs. 4(f)–4(j) ]. Interestingly, as shown in Figs. 4(f)–4(h) , as the uric acid concentration increased, with the melamine concentration fixed, melamine participated more in systems P0 and P1 [ Figs. 4(g) and 4(h) ] than in system S0 [ Fig. 4(f) ]. This indicates that melamine forms more complexes with uric acid in the presence of a higher concentration of uric acid molecules, where uric acid “drags” melamine towards itself. Again, comparing the similar distributions of density for systems N0 and N1 ( Fig. 5 ), a pattern can be seen for these two systems in comparison with the other systems presented earlier. Comparison of systems S0 and Su shows more clearly that there was no interference of melamine with the distribution of uric acid around a reference uric acid, as the two systems showed a similar pattern [ Figs. 5(c) and 5(f) ]."

                        "To draw preliminary conclusions regarding the solute-solute interactions, as well as the interactions between solute and solvent, it is appropriate to calculate their mutual propensities to each other; in this regard, Kirkwood–Buff (KB) solution theory represents a convenient way to determine the preferential interactions between a solute and co-solvent and the preferential solute-solute interactions in presence of solvents. KB theory has a wide range of applications in solvation chemistry; for example, in studies of the association of ions, interactions of solvents with proteins, and the impact of solvent on conformations in protein-peptide chemistry. Principally, this approach involves measuring thermodynamical properties with the assessment of structural changes in solutions, in order to establish a relation of volume integrals over the pair distribution functions for the derivatives of the chemical potentials. According to KB theory, which was originally constructed using the grand-canonical (μVT) ensemble, the associated KB integrals are taken as the volume integrals over the pair distribution function of species i and j present in the systems, where r is the measure of the scalar distance between the COMs of that species, i.e., i and j.",
                        "Now, considering a spherical symmetry, this integral over volume in Eq. (6) can be written as:",
                        "Using the isothermal-isobaric (NpT) ensemble under periodic boundary conditions, the following equation can be approximated as: where Gij(r) represents the pair correlation functions of a closed ensemble and R is the measure of the upper limit of a correlation region around the center of a particular molecule, below which the pair distribution function is governed by the intermolecular interactions between species i and j.",
                        "At a molecular level, the aggregation tendency of melamine and uric acid molecules can be estimated by determining the preferential interaction parameter, τ.",
                        "Here, KB theory was used to estimate the preferential interaction parameters of solute melamine (uric acid) with like molecules over uric acid (melamine) and solvent water, as follows: where m, u, and w correspond to melamine, uric acid, and water, respectively, and ρm and ρu denote the number densities of melamine and uric acid, respectively. The positive τmwm value indicates more favorable melamine-melamine interactions compared with melamine-water interactions, and so on. Gmm and Gmw reciprocate to KB integrals. These integrals can be obtained from the melamine-melamine and melamine-water rdfs. In the estimation of these distribution functions, COM of melamine and water molecules were taken into consideration. Using Eqs. (9) and (10) , the values of τmwm and τuwu were determined for systems S0–S3, where the ratio [melamine]:[uric acid] is 1:1 with increasing concentrations of both melamine and uric acid. The change in these values can be seen in Fig. 6(a) . As shown in the figure, both melamine and uric acid interacted preferably with themselves over water, that is, the corresponding preferential interaction parameters had positive values. Furthermore, the preferential interactions among uric acid molecules were greater than those among melamine molecules in water for systems S0–S2. For system S3, the value of τmwm and τuwu do not differ as much, possibly owing to the saturation of the solution at this concentration of melamine and uric acid in water. For systems S0, P0, and P1, the melamine concentration was fixed while the concentration of uric acid was increased. In these systems, the value of τmwm showed almost no change, while the value of τuwu increased consistently [ Fig. 6(b) ]. Similar changes were observed for systems S0, P2, and P3, in which the concentration of uric acid was fixed [ Fig. 6(c) ]. In these systems, τmwm changed continuously and showed an increasing trend, whereas the value of τuwu remained nearly unchanged. These results suggest that melamine interacts preferentially with other melamine molecules, and uric acid interacts preferentially with other uric acid molecules, in all cases. The same was true for the N0 and N1 systems (not shown).",
                        "The preferential interaction parameters for melamine-uric acid interaction over melamine-melamine and uric acid-melamine interaction over uric acid-uric acid were also determined to obtain a better understanding of which interaction predominates when both melamine and uric acid molecules are present in solution. Figure 7(a) shows the preferential interaction parameters for melamine-uric acid interaction over melamine-melamine for systems S0, P0, and P1. Here, melamine interacted more with uric acid than with other melamine molecules present in the system. Furthermore, the preferential interaction parameters for uric acid-melamine interactions over uric acid-uric acid interactions were negative. These results indicate that uric acid preferentially interacts with other uric acid molecules rather than with melamine. This was also the case for systems S0, P2, and P3 [ Fig. 7(b) ], and for systems S1–S3, N0, and N1 (not shown)."

                        "In this section, we examine how uric acid molecules orient themselves close to another solute, that is, melamine. To understand the orientational configuration of uric acid molecules in solution in the presence of melamine, we considered the angle between the molecular planes of these molecules. To examine the interactions owing to π–π stacking between the aromatic planes of uric acid and melamine, the probability of orientational angles between two uric acid molecules and two melamine molecules was determined separately alongside the interplanar angle between melamine and uric acid molecules, by considering the angle between two vector normals of any two aromatic planes ( Fig. 8 ). The angles, i.e., 0°, 90°, and 180°, between these vector normals correspond to the parallel, perpendicular, and anti-parallel stacking between the two aromatic planes, respectively. In Fig. 9 , the probability distribution of angle θ, P(θ), as a component of the inter-planar angle (θ) is plotted for systems S0–S3. For systems, S0 and S1, a broad distribution of P(θ) was observed, and the maximum of P(θ) was reached at θ ≃ 50° for melamine-melamine interactions. Furthermore, for the S2 and S3 systems, two peaks at θ ≃ 50° and θ = 122°–135° were apparent. From these angle values (θ), it appears that melamine does not interact with other melamine molecules through π–π stacking interactions. In the case of uric acid-uric acid interactions, one can reasonably suppose that uric acid prefers to interact with other uric acid molecules through π–π stacking, as the maximum value of P(θ) appeared at 20° along with a very small peak at θ = 165°–175° for systems S0–S3. For melamine-uric acid interactions, the maximum value of P(θ) was observed when θ ≃ 60°. Based on these values of θ, we can conclude that melamine molecules associate with other uric acid molecules in water overwhelmingly through hydrogen-bonding interactions (discussed below), with a very low probability of π–π interactions. As the concentration of melamine and uric acid increased from system S0 to S3, the peak height increased. It is important to note here that π–π stacking made a small contribution to the melamine-melamine interactions in comparison with the hydrogen-bonding interactions. Interestingly, however, uric acid molecules self-aggregated with other uric acid present in the system through π–π stacking in particular, with negligible contributions from hydrogen-bonding interactions (see below). This was the case for all systems S0–S3 at 300 K ( Fig. 9 ). For systems in which the concentration of melamine was fixed and the concentration of uric acid varied (with an increasing trend for systems S0, P0, and P1), similar orientational preferences were observed for melamine-melamine, uric acid-uric acid, and melamine-uric acid interactions ( Fig. 10 ). Similar results were obtained for systems S0, P2, and P3 ( Fig. 11 ), in which the concentration of melamine was increased while the concentration of uric acid was fixed. In systems N0 and N1, where the melamine:uric acid ratios were 2:3 and 3:2, respectively, a similar pattern was produced [ Figs. 12(a)–12(c) ]. In system Su (free uric acid in water without melamine), uric acid was shown to form stacking interactions [ Fig. 12(b) ]. This reference system was used to determine whether or not the orientational preference of free uric acid in water was hindered in the presence of a foreign element such as melamine. The results showed that melamine did not alter the interaction of uric acids; rather, melamine bound to the stacked uric acids through hydrogen bond formation in particular (see below).",
                        "These stacking interactions are only meaningful when the two interacting molecules simultaneously maintain a particular angle and meet a particular distance criterion ( Fig. 8 ). From the results discussed above, it is clear that when two uric acid molecules are involved in π–π stacking, they maintain the angle (0°–20°). It was also important to measure the distance between the uric acids to check that they met the distance criterion as well as the specific angle. To do this, the distance between two uric acid cores was measured for all systems. In Fig. 13 , the probabilities of the distances between two uric acids are given. An average distance of 3 Å with a maximum of 7 Å was maintained for all systems considered in the present study. These distance values, together with the angles determined earlier, constitute further evidence of π–π stacking between the aromatic cores of two uric acid molecules in water."

                        "The clusters of different sizes that are formed by melamine-melamine, uric acid-uric acid, and melamine-uric acid interactions were determined using a distance criterion between two distinctive solute molecules. Considering melamine-melamine clusters first, two different melamine molecules, say M1 and M2, can form a dimer if the COMs of these two molecules are locked in by a distance of 5 Å (that is, the COM-COM distance between M1 and M2). Now, if the COM of a third melamine M3 comes within this distance range, i.e., 5 Å of either M1 or M2 ( Fig. 14 ), then a trimer (comprising M1, M2, and M3) is formed. A similar definition for melamine clusters applies to clusters of higher orders. A similar definition was used for uric acid-uric acid clusters. In this case, the COM-COM distance between two uric acid molecules was taken to be 6 Å ( Fig. 14 ). For clusters formed by melamine-uric acid interactions, two different approaches were used, involving “direct” and “indirect” contact between melamine and uric acid molecules. In direct contact, two melamine molecules, say M1 and M2, are directly attached to two uric acid molecules U1 and U2, or to one uric acid molecule, say either U1 or U2. The distance criterion was taken as earlier, with a COMm-COMu distance of 7 Å. In the indirect contact approach, the COMm-COMm distance (for melamine-melamine contact) was 5 Å, the COMu-COMu distance (uric acid-uric acid contact) was 6 Å and the COMm-COMu distance (melamine-uric acid contact) was 7 Å. Thus, in the indirect contact approach, two melamine molecules can form a cluster with uric acid in which one of the two melamine molecules is not in contact with uric acid directly but by bridging through a melamine molecule. This is also true in the case of two uric acid molecules where one is linked through another uric acid bridge. The results for melamine-uric acid cluster structure formation were obtained through a combination of the two approaches (direct and indirect contact) ( Fig. 15 ).",
                        "Figure 16 shows the maximum size of melamine-uric acid aggregates determined for systems S0–S3. The last 20 ns trajectories of the total MD production runs were used, and results were obtained over time intervals of 184 ns–200 ns in 4 ns steps. In the case of system S0, the largest cluster composed of melamine and uric acid was a hexamer or heptamer ( Fig. 16 and Fig. S1). Moreover, this hexamer/heptamer was an aggregate of two or three melamine molecules with four uric acid molecules. Thus, of the 10 molecules (five molecules each of melamine and uric acid) present in system S0, six or seven are involved in the formation of an aggregate. This suggests that the interaction between melamine and uric acid is quite strong. Furthermore, in all aggregates for system S0, 80% of the uric acid molecules present came close enough to form a tetramer, whereas 40%–60% of the melamine molecules present in the system preferentially bound to the uric acid aggregates. Similarly, for systems S1, S2, and S3, larger clusters were formed with increasing concentration; the cluster size increased from system S0 to S3 ( Fig. 16 and Fig. S1). This indicates that melamine forms a strong complex with uric acid in water. Interestingly, in systems S0–S3, where the [melamine]:[uric acid] ratio was 1:1, the percentage of uric acid that formed an aggregate with melamine was higher than the corresponding percentage of melamine in all cases. It was then of interest to determine cluster sizes for different melamine: uric acid ratios. Clusters of various sizes were determined for systems P0 and P1, which had higher concentrations of uric acid. It was clear that for these systems, 100% of the uric acid present went into clusters ( Fig. 17 and Fig. S2). Furthermore, 80%–100% of the total melamine was involved in forming these large clusters. When the concentration of melamine was varied in systems P2 and P3, a similar scenario was observed. Interestingly, however, not all melamine molecules participated in cluster formation with uric acid for these systems ( Fig. 17 and Fig. S2). Similarly, noteworthy complexation was found for systems N0 and N1 ( Fig. 17 and Fig. S2). These observations clearly show that the self-aggregation tendency of uric acid is greater than that of melamine (discussed below). Furthermore, melamine is more “attracted” towards the larger clusters formed by uric acid. This conclusion was verified by performing cluster size determination for the self-assembly of melamine-melamine and uric acid-uric acid for all systems. Now, considering the melamine-melamine cluster sizes for all systems, higher-order clusters were observed in substantial quantities for all systems containing a significant percentage of the monomer ( Fig. 18 ). However, in the case of uric acid, higher-order clusters were formed in systems with a low percentage of monomer units ( Fig. 19 ). Again for uric acid, both the size of the cluster and the probability of formation of higher-order clusters were greater than those of melamine-melamine clusters in systems S0–S3, in which the concentration ratio was 1:1 ( Fig. 19 ). A considerable quantity of higher-order clusters was also found for the other systems ( Fig. 19 ). Moreover, comparing systems S0 and Su, 80% tetramer and 20% monomer were found in the former, in contrast to 60% pentamer with 4% monomer and the remainder consisting of tetramer, trimer, and dimer for Su ( Fig. 19 ). Thus, the presence of melamine in S0 did not affect uric acid aggregation; rather, it bound to pre-existing clusters of uric acid ( Fig. 19 )."

                        "MM-PBSA is widely used to measure the binding free energies of complexes formed by macromolecules. Free energy perturbation techniques can also be used for this purpose, but the MM-PBSA technique is 10 times faster than conventional methods. MM-PBSA is also computationally less expensive as it uses a continuum solvent model. In the present study, the binding free energy was calculated by decomposing it into components for specific types of interactions between melamine and uric acid molecules during complexation. We chose uric acid as the receptor and melamine as the ligand, and investigated the driving force for the binding of ligand molecules to receptors, in order to obtain a better understanding of melamine-uric acid complexation.",
                        "All energy values for the various systems considered in the present study are summarized in Table V . As shown in the table, the total binding free energies ( ΔG0bind ) were negative for all systems. This indicates that melamine-uric acid complex formation is favorable in water. Again, one would typically expect to find an extremely favorable electrostatic energy (ΔEelec) and an unfavorable solvation free energy (ΔGsol = ΔEPB + ΔENP). This symbolizes the energy required to desolvate the binding particles and to align their binding interfaces. Furthermore, taking the results together, it can be seen that a considerable contribution to the binding free energy is made by the favorable melamine-uric acid van der Waals interactions (ΔEvdW), but the electrostatic energy component (ΔEelec) is the main driving force behind melamine-uric acid complex formation. For systems S0–S3, the ΔG0bind was more favorable. This indicates that the greater the concentration of melamine alongside uric acid in a system, the stronger the complexation that will occur. Moreover, in systems P2 and P3, in which the melamine concentration was increased in comparison with S0, the ΔG0bind had more negative values. Similarly, the negative ΔG0bind for systems P0 and P1 increased when the concentration of uric acid was increased, while keeping the melamine concentration fixed, in contrast to system S0. This trend was also observed for systems N0 and N1. These results indicate that an increase in concentration of either melamine or uric acid in a system is favorable for complexation between melamine and uric acid molecules in water. Note that MM-PBSA gives favorable binding free energy when the ligands and receptors are in direct contact. Thus, the total negative binding free energies ( ΔG0bind ) only correspond to direct contact between melamine and uric acid in water ( Table V ). In order to compute the total complexation energies, both direct and indirect contacts (as discussed above) should be taken into consideration for all systems. All melamine-melamine and uric acid-uric acid indirect contacts should be added to the melamine-uric acid direct contacts to obtain the total complexation energy. This complexation energy gives a more accurate picture of the formation of clusters among the melamine and uric acid molecules in water ( Fig. 20 ). In the present study, the complexation energy for system S0 was determined so that an overall idea and conclusion could be developed and applied to the remaining systems. To do so, ΔG0bind values for melamine-melamine, uric acid-uric acid, and melamine-uric acid were determined using the last 4 ns trajectories of system S0. In this system, melamine-melamine direct contacts were missing, but uric acid-uric acid direct contacts were present, as were melamine-uric acid contacts. The cluster structure analysis showed that for the last 4 ns, four of the five uric acids formed a complex with three of the five melamine molecules. However, none of the three melamine molecules were in direct contact with each other. This was verified by the cluster structure analysis for melamine-melamine contacts for the last 20 ns, in which 76% molecules were found to be in monomeric states while the remaining 24% were involved in dimer formation. Thus, it was apparent that no direct contacts could exist among melamine molecules in the last 4 ns trajectories. In the determination of total complexation energy for system S0, the ΔG0bind values for uric acid-uric acid and melamine-uric acid contacts were added together to give the total binding free energies. As shown in Table VI , the overall complexation energy was more negative than the ΔG0bind for direct melamine-uric acid binding. This indicates that the total complexation through all contact types among melamine and uric acid molecules was favorable in the case of system S0; this may also be true for the remaining systems."

                        "We used umbrella sampling techniques to calculate the potential of mean force (PMF) values of single melamine and uric acid molecules alongside that of a melamine-uric acid dimer, in order to determine the possibility of clusters developing from a pre-existing dimer of melamine and uric acid. Three consecutive simulations were performed to determine the PMF using the umbrella sampling method. First, one molecule each of melamine and uric acid was immersed in 3000 water molecules at 300 K. This allowed us to calculate the PMF of melamine-uric acid interaction as a function of the distance between the COMs of these two molecules. In that case, at a distance of 3.2 Å, a minimum was found with an energy value of −0.58 kcal/mol ( Fig. 21 ). This negative free energy suggests that melamine-uric acid aggregation is quite favorable at 300 K. Next, another two umbrella sampling simulations were performed, in which a second molecule, either melamine or uric acid, was introduced to the pre-existing melamine-uric acid dimer in 3000 water molecules at 300 K. To do so, two separate “springs” were applied. The first spring was used to maintain the pre-existing dimer at a fixed separation. In this case, the equilibrium separation was 3.2 Å. This equilibrium separation was the same for all of the umbrella windows. The second spring was fixed between the COM of a third molecule and the COM of one of the molecules in the dimer. The equilibrium distance between the second spring of the reference molecule and the third molecule was then varied between 2 and 16 Å in small increments 0.5 Å to obtain the PMFs. This resulted in the formation of two types of trimers: melamine-melamine-uric acid and melamine-uric acid-uric acid. Notably, two further trimers could be formed when starting with a melamine-uric acid dimer: melamine-uric acid-melamine and uric acid-melamine-uric acid. However, these were ignored here, as the MM-PBSA calculations (discussed earlier) showed favorable negative binding energies for melamine-uric acid direct contacts in all systems (S0–S3, P0–P3, N0, and N1). The resulting PMF curves for melamine-melamine-uric acid and melamine-uric acid-uric acid trimer formation in water are shown in Fig. 21 as a function of the distance between the COMs of the third molecule and the reference molecule. The negative free energy of aggregation in these two cases indicates that as the aggregate increases in size, further aggregation becomes more favorable (more negative PMF values). All simulations for umbrella sampling followed the protocols described in our previous papers."

The DACF for a pair of molecules i and j is the autocorrelation of a straightforward function βij, which takes the value 1 while the distance criterion is met, and becomes zero when the distance criterion “breaks” for the first time. Thus,",
                        "Note that the DACF remains zero even if the criterion is again satisfied later. DACFs for all combinations (melamine-melamine, uric acid-uric acid, and melamine-uric acid) are presented in Fig. 22 .",

As shown in Fig. 22 , the DACF of the melamine-melamine pair fell to zero very fast in all systems, suggesting that it has a very short lifetime. However, for the melamine-uric acid and uric acid-uric acid interactions, the lifetimes of the dimers were quite long for all systems. As the concentration of melamine increased, the lifetime of the melamine-melamine dimer also increased. For example, comparing systems S0 and S3, there is a marked increase in the lifetime of the melamine-melamine dimer. The lifetime of the melamine dimer was quite short compared with that of the uric acid-uric acid dimer in all systems except S3, in which its lifetime was reasonably long; thus, one would expect melamine interactions to result in a low percentage of larger clusters. By contrast, as the lifetime of dimer formation was long for melamine-uric acid and uric acid-uric acid interactions, there was a larger percentage of higher-order clusters. This was true for all systems presented in this study."

First, the average number of hydrogen bonds among all the atomic sites of uric acid (per uric acid) with the sp3N atoms present in melamine for all systems are given in Table VII . No clear trend in these values could be found for any of the systems. All like atomic sites of uric acid produced a nearly equal number of hydrogen bonds with the sp3N atoms present in melamine for a particular system. Similar results (i.e., no obvious trend) were also be observed when average hydrogen bond numbers were determined ( Table VIII ) among all the atomic sites of uric acid (per uric acid) with the sp2N atoms present in melamine.",
                        "Numbers of hydrogen bonds in melamine-melamine and uric acid-uric acid were also determined. As shown in our earlier studies, melamine utilizes nine hydrogen-bonding sites (6 H-donors and 3 H-acceptors) when forming hydrogen bonds with other melamine molecules present in the system. Thus, to determine the average number of hydrogen bonds between two melamine molecules, sp3 N–H⋯sp3 N and sp3 N–H⋯sp2 N were taken into account ( Table IX ). As uric acid-uric acid interactions involve a very small number of hydrogen bonds in comparison with melamine-melamine and melamine-uric acid interactions, the total number of hydrogen bonds (per uric acid) was determined in this case. The site-site number of hydrogen bonds in uric acid-uric acid interactions has not opted ( Table IX ). It is clear that melamine prefers to interact with other melamine through hydrogen-bonding interactions, whereas uric acid formed a much lower number of hydrogen bonds in all systems. In the comparison between systems S0 and Su, owing to the interaction between melamine and uric acid molecules, the total number of uric acid-uric acid hydrogen bond numbers was reduced in system S0 compared with system Su.",
                        "Similarly, hydrogen bonds may also occur in melamine-water, uric acid-water, and water-water interactions. Thus, in an aqueous melamine-uric acid solution, water-water (Hw–w), melamine sp3 N-water Ow (Hsp3N–Ow), melamine sp2 N-water Ow (Hsp2N–Ow) hydrogen bonds were determined, along with those of uric acid-water, considering all atomic sites ( Table X ). Melamine formed more hydrogen bonds with water through its sp3N sites than through its sp2N sites. Moreover, the total number of melamine-water hydrogen bonds was much higher than that of uric acid-water hydrogen bonds ( Table X ). This was the case for all the systems considered here. Furthermore, these results match well with the CN values of water around melamine and uric acid discussed above. Hw–w was similar for all systems. This result confirms that melamine-melamine, uric acid-uric acid, and melamine-uric acid interactions do not influence the water-water hydrogen bonds.",
                        "In this regard, it is notable that to determine the number of hydrogen bonds (discussed above) involved in all types of interaction, a set of criteria was chosen to define a hydrogen bond between the donor (D) and acceptor (A) atoms. If D-A ⩽ rcut and, simultaneously, ∠D-H⋯A ⩾ 120°, then hydrogen bonding was considered to be present. In the present study, the positions of the first minimum in the relating rdfs (not shown) were taken as rcut. The last 100 ns of a total production run was used to calculate all hydrogen bond numbers, as all systems converged well within the last 100 ns of the simulation time (Fig. S5)."

Here, the melamine-melamine interaction was not considered as it had already been discussed in our previous study. First, the complexation energy with BSSE correction using B3LYP-D3/6-311++G(d,p) level theory of all combinations of uric acid dimers was calculated in the gas phase. A set of structures in which hydrogen-bonding interactions were present [Figs. S6(a)–S6(e), S7(a)–S7(o), and S8(a)–S8(j)] along with stacked conformations between two uric acid molecules [Figs. S9(a)–S9(d)] were considered. These structures, which are presented in Figs. S7(b), S7(c), S7(n), and S8(a), are the most stable hydrogen-bonded structures of all the hydrogen-bonded configurations of uric acid dimers. This would seem to suggest that uric acid forms long hydrogen-bonded sheets during its self-organization. However, closer examination of these dimer structures reveals that they form a symmetrical and complementary structure to each other. For this reason, repeating a similar structure to form a large cluster such as a hydrogen-bonded sheet is not possible, as the third uric acid molecule added to any dimer would not be able to form a similar pattern to that of the pre-existing dimer. Thus, the formation of such structures is possible only when they form discrete dimers or when pre-existing π-stacked structures come into close proximity and form hydrogen bonds between two π-stacked strands. Other stable structures resulting from uric acid-uric acid complexation have lower or similar energies (around −16 to −18 kcal/mol) to those of melamine-uric acid structures. Melamine and uric acid can form four types of hydrogen-bonded structure [Figs. S9(e)–S9(h)], of which two are non-coplanar [Figs. S9(e) and S9(f)] and the other two are coplanar [Figs. S9(g) and S9(h)]. A proper explanation of these structures can be found elsewhere. The melamine-uric acid structure is more symmetric and can be repeated in all directions to create a symmetrical long hydrogen-bonded sheet structure, but this is not possible for the most stable uric acid-uric acid dimers. Again, stacking between uric acid and uric acid is more probable than melamine-uric acid stacking [Figs. S9(a)–S9(d) and S9(i)]. All these configurations reveal that uric acid-uric acid π–π stacking is the more reliable configuration and, as a result, hydrogen bonding between pre-existing π–π stacked structures of uric acid molecules is quite normal. The DFT and MD simulation results of the present study are also consistent with the experimental crystal structure of uric acid."

The CN values of melamine around uric acid and uric acid around melamine were determined. The coordination number of melamine around a reference uric acid varied from 1 to 3, as did that of uric acid around a reference melamine. This result is consistent with experimental data showing that renal stones from infants consuming melamine-contaminated formula were composed of uric acid and melamine in a 1:2 to 2.1:1 molar ratio with no cyanuric acid present.",
                "The determination of spatial density distributions of melamine around a reference uric acid and uric acid around a reference melamine clearly showed that the distributions of uric acid and melamine around one another become more compact and symmetric when both molecules are present in higher number in a system. The preferential interaction parameters (based on KB theory) for melamine-uric acid interaction over melamine-melamine and uric acid-melamine interaction over uric acid-uric acid were determined. Melamine interacted more with uric acid than with other melamine molecules present in a system, and uric acid preferentially interacted with other uric acid molecules rather than melamine. These results imply that in the presence of uric acid, melamine interacts more with uric acid than with other melamine molecules. This result was supported by the estimation of spatial density distributions. Again, the CN values of melamine around melamine varied from 0.12 to a maximum of 1.01, whereas the CN of uric acid around uric acid ranged from 1.04 to 1.98. These data also support the notion that in the presence of uric acid, melamine interacts more with uric acid than with other melamine molecules.",
                "The calculations of the orientational preference of aromatic planes of melamine and uric acid molecules suggest that π–π stacking interaction plays a key part in uric acid-uric acid interactions in water. Similarly, the CNs of uric acid were explained by their π-stacked structures. Melamine molecules associated with other uric acid molecules in water overwhelmingly through hydrogen bonding interactions, with a very low probability of π–π interactions. Furthermore, in melamine-melamine self-association, π–π interaction plays a less significant part. These results show good consistency with those of previous experimental and theoretical studies. Experimentally, it has been well established that melamine can form self-aggregating complexes through hydrogen bonds as well as π–π aromatic ring-stacking interactions with other analogs. These experimental findings match well with the results of the present study. Further, in vitro testing by Grases et al. revealed that at a certain pH value, melamine and uric acid form insoluble compounds with a structure related to that of the insoluble compound of melamine and cyanuric acid. Beton et al. demonstrated a highly symmetric hydrogen-bonded two-dimensional array of cyanuric acid and melamine. Thus, it can be assumed that melamine also forms a complex with uric acid in which hydrogen bonding has a dominant role compared with π–π aromatic ring-stacking interactions. Chen et al. reported that carbonyl (-CO) groups and amino groups (-NH2) produce a strong interaction between uric acid and melamine molecules. In a melamine-uric acid system, melamine acts as an electron donor, resulting in a more effective interaction with uric acid, which acts as an electron acceptor. Such donor-acceptor conjugations enable π–π stacking in addition to hydrogen bonding, and these dual interactions cause more complexation between melamine and uric acid. This explains why the complex formed by melamine and uric acid is more stable than other any complexes formed in the kidney.",
                "Cluster structure analyses of melamine-uric acid interactions suggested that the presence of either melamine or uric acid or the presence of both molecules in higher concentration in a system produces a large insoluble complex cluster. Thus, the higher the concentration, the larger the cluster of melamine and uric acid molecules in water. Chen et al. showed experimentally that the fluorescence of melamine molecules is quenched with increasing uric acid concentration. This quenching can be attributed to the interaction of uric acid with melamine particles. Generally, an excessive dosage of melamine can cause renal problems in humans owing to the development of insoluble stones. Given the nature of the interaction of melamine and uric acid molecules, it might be possible to rapidly resolve this renal impairment. Again, abnormal metabolism of nucleic acid bases is the cause of the accumulation of uric acid that results in kidney stone formation. Our MM-PBSA results show that the higher the concentration of melamine in the presence of uric acid in the system, the stronger their complexation. Moreover, this complexation has a favorable negative binding energy, which further demonstrates the stronger interaction of melamine and uric acid. Interestingly, these findings closely resemble those of the experimental studies, in which a higher binding constant with lower binding distance was found, with negative free energy change. This negative sign for free energy change indicates the spontaneity of the binding of uric acid and melamine molecules. Moreover, the overall complexation energy [ ΔG0bind (mel-mel) + ΔG0bind (uri-uri) + ΔG0bind (mel-uri)] was more negative than the ΔG0bind for melamine-uric acid complexation. Thus, the total complexation through all types of contact in melamine-uric acid-water ternary systems is favorable.",
                "The lifetimes of uric acid-uric acid and melamine-uric acid dimer were similar and long. The lifetime of a melamine dimer was quite short compared with those of uric acid-uric acid dimers in all systems. Thus, one can expect a low percentage of the larger clusters resulting from melamine-melamine interactions, given that strong melamine-uric acid interactions tend to occur rather than melamine-melamine self-association in water. Furthermore, as the lifetime of dimer formation was long for melamine-uric acid and uric acid-uric acid interactions, the percentage of higher-order clusters was high for all systems presented in this study. These findings indicate that the stronger interaction in uric acid-uric acid leads to the formation of stable uric acid clusters; thus, the larger clusters composed only of uric acid in water “drag” the melamine molecules around themselves to form melamine-uric acid clusters of larger sizes. Interestingly, these results are well explained by the preferential interaction parameter values. Moreover, this result is consistent with those of the cluster structure analysis. Hydrogen bond analyses revealed that melamine mainly forms hydrogen bonds with uric acid, whereas melamine forms a hydrogen-bonded complex with uric acid, using all available sites. This results in stronger complexation between the two molecule types in water. Uric acid predominately interacts with other uric acid molecules present in a system through π–π stacking rather than hydrogen bonding, as the number of uric acid-uric acid hydrogen bonds in water is very low compared with the number of melamine-uric acid and melamine-melamine hydrogen bonds. Again, melamine-melamine interaction is dominated by hydrogen bonding in particular; the consequences of this are validated well by our previous studies. Moreover, the hydrogen bonding results of the present study match well with recent experimental findings. Finally, it is important to note that the melamine-melamine, uric acid-uric acid, and melamine-uric acid interactions do not influence the tetrahedrally coordinated water structure."
