                "The n-type Bi2Te3 films with well-ordered microstructures were deposited on SiO2/Si substrates by unbalanced magnetron sputtering (UBMS) technique. Fully compact oriented films were obtained around RT and 400 K. The (00l) textured films with both in-plane and out-of-plane ordering were fabricated successfully. The in-plane ordering consists of high density of low-angle grain boundaries, which results in notable increase of the electrical conductivity and the improvement in thermoelectric properties from RT to 473 K.

                "Bi2Te3-based alloys are the most widely used semiconductor materials in bulk thermoelectric (TE) devices working around ambient temperature [1]. A great effort has been devoted in the past decades to improve the energy conversion efficiency of the Bi2Te3-based alloys, mainly utilizing the low-dimensional effects of the nanostructured materials through the top-down and bottom-up synthesis approaches [2]. Among the improving strategies, grain boundary engineering is the most impactful one to fully boost the thermoelectric performances. Grain boundaries have striking influence on the thermoelectric properties of the nanostructured polycrystalline Bi2Te3-based materials. For example, low-angle grain boundaries (LGBs) are expected to effectively reduce the scattering of the conductive electrons and impede phonon propagation, which could coincidently lower the electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity [3]. Very recently, nanostructured Bi2Te3-based thin films have attracted particular interest across scientific and engineering disciplines, because they break new ground in the promising applications such as chip-scale micro-cooler for thermal management of high-powered micro/nano-electronics and flexible micro-power generator for energy harvesting [4] and [5]. Due to the tremendous progresses in nanoscience and nanotechnology in recent years, the thermoelectric performance of the Bi2Te3-based alloys has been significantly enhanced, especially in the thin film materials with well-ordered structures,[6] which promote much higher thermoelectric efficiency than that of the bulk counterpart. Similarly, the numerous influences of the compositions, microstructures, morphologies, thickness, stress-strain and substrate conditions on the thermoelectric properties of Bi2Te3-based thin films are intensively reported in the literatures [7] and [8]. Furthermore, the optimized composition of the nano/microstructured Bi2Te3-based thin film can be acquired through controlling the growth conditions, which can concurrently improve the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of the synthesized thin films, and hence remarkably enhancing the power factor. Recent progresses of the Bi2Te3-based thin films have given rise to very promising perspective application of the present micro-scale thermoelectric devices. Motivated by the broad impact on commercial device application and basic science, a considerable amount of research works have been focused on developing new techniques to fabricate Bi2Te3-based thin films, including various physical and chemical approaches. However, it is still challenging to develop economically techniques to fabricate compact thin film thermoelectric materials with well-ordered microstructures, good film-to-substrate adhesion, as well as controllable composition and thickness. To date, direct-current (DC) and/or radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering is the most widely employed and the only demonstrated deposition technique for large-scale fabrication of commercial grade micro-devices [9]. To optimize the thermoelectric performance, the Bi2Te3-based thin films are typically grown and/or annealed at relative high temperature (> 0.6Tm, Tm is the melting temperature of the deposition material). At such high temperature, the sticking problems might induce growth stress due to the huge differences of the thermal expansion coefficients between the films and the substrates, giving rise to the difficult to grow “thick” enough films for practically usable devices [9]. Besides, the Te re-evaporation effect could cause Te deficiency and hence the porous microstructure/morphology at temperature > 623 K, which may degrade the thermoelectric and mechanical properties of the synthesized films [8]. Moreover, it is still a tough problem to directly deposit Bi2Te3-based films on the substrates which are extremely susceptible to the temperature, such as photoresist for depositing device layout patterns.",
                "In this work, we developed a low temperature approach to deposit n-type Bi2Te3 films with well-ordered microstructures, morphologies and grain size from nano- to micro-scales by unbalanced magnetron sputtering (UBMS) technique. The growth temperature of the Bi2Te3 films deposited by this technique is in the temperature range of 300–400 K, which is much lower than that usually employed by the conventional magnetron sputtering (CMS) technique [10]. The synthesized films are composed of textured grains with LGBs, which can obviously increase the electrical conductivity and thermoelectric properties. Furthermore, the films with thickness of ~ 20 μm and good adhesion to the substrates are successfully synthesized. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding to the growth mechanism of the Bi2Te3 films deposited by UBMS is discussed in this paper.",
                "A home-built unbalanced DC magnetron sputtering system is employed in this study, which also has been described in detail in our previous work [11]. The Bi2Te3 alloy films were deposited on SiO2 (300 nm)/Si (100) substrates at temperatures of 300–400 K. Before film deposition, the substrate temperatures were stabilized for long enough time to ensure the heating temperature fluctuation is ≤±1 K. The operating Ar pressure was maintained at ~ 0.5 Pa during the growth process. A single commercial 4 inches Bi2Te3 target (99.99%) was used and the distance between target and substrate was ~ 100 mm. The operation frequency of pulsed DC was 15 KHz with duty ration 30% and the sputtering power is maintained at ~ 80 W. The deposition rate ≥ 5 μm/h was used in this work. An increase of the substrate temperature induced by the ion bombardment self-heating effect was observed to be ~ 20–30 °C in a few minutes after the beginning of deposition. The microstructures of the samples were systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2010Lab6). The thickness of samples was measured by SEM cross-section images. Energy-disperse spectrum (EDS) was employed to ascertain the compositions of the films and check their uniformity along depth with a measuring error less than 3%. The electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and selected area electron diffraction (SAD) were used to determine the grain orientations. Netzsch SBA-458 system was employed to measure the electrical conductivity (σ) and Seebeck coefficient (S) simultaneously with Ar (99.999%) gas protection from RT to 473 K. The measurement error for electrical conductivity is 3%, for Seebeck coefficient is 5%. The Hall coefficient was measured by the HMS-3000 Hall system using the Van der Pauw method. The carrier densities n at room temperature were determined on the assumption Hall coefficient RH equals to 1/ne and the Hall mobility μH was calculated based on μH = σ / ne.",
                "We first examine the microstructures of the as-deposited samples. The cross-section and top-view SEM images of the films deposited at the temperatures of RT and 400 K (heated temperature) are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). It can be seen that the compact Bi2Te3 films with average grain size ~ 100 nm can be synthesized on the non-heated substrate. However, no perceivable nano-porous structures can be detected, which are typically observed in the Bi2Te3 films fabricated by alternative deposition techniques at relative low temperatures. As shown in the cross-section SEM images, the film can be grown up to ~ 20 μm in thickness using high deposition rate without micro-crack and/or peeling off from the substrates. The films exhibit columnar structures featured by stacking layers with thickness ~ 50 nm [7]. The chemical compositions of the films are determined by EDS to be ~ Bi42Te58, while the sputtering target composition is ~ Bi40Te60. The uniformity of the film composition along the thickness is confirmed by the cross-sectional samples. The microstructures of the films deposited on 400 K heated substrates are shown in Fig. 1(c)–(f), where the films exhibit hexagonal surface morphologies. The cross-section SEM images present obvious columnar grain growth with nano-sized lamella structures. Interestingly, in the films deposited on the substrate only near the center area of the sample holder appears the equiaxed grain shape with an average grain size ~ 0.6 μm as well as random surface morphology (called RSM hereafter), as shown in Fig. 1(c). Whereas, with regard to the samples located away from the center of the sample holder, the films display a substantial degree of in-plane ordering. The lateral growth steps of the films are featured by some preferential orientations and present well-ordered morphologies (called WOM hereafter) in large scale, as shown in Fig. 1(d). The width of the growth step is ~ 200 nm and the average grain size is over ~ 1.5 μm. Actually, the in-plane crystallographic orientations between neighboring grains are very close, generally smaller than 15 degree indicated by the EBSD measurement. The grain boundary and orientations of two neighboring grains are schematically depicted in the Fig. 1(f). The microstructures of the WOM samples were further examined by the TEM analysis, as shown in the Fig. 2. The small misorientations between the neighboring grains are confirmed by the corresponding SAD patterns, confirming the dominant existence of the LGBs in the as-deposited films.",
                "Fig. 3 provides the XRD patterns of the deposited films and the sputtering target. According to the diffraction patterns, all of the samples and the sputtering targets can be identified as rhombohedral Bi2Te3 phase (JCPDS 15-0863). The sputtering target reveals a non-textured polycrystalline Bi2Te3. While, for the films deposited on the non-heated substrate, highly out-of-plane (015) textured structures are observed. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of (015) diffraction peak is only ~ 0.3 degree, indicating a good crystallinity of the synthesized films. For the samples deposited on 400 K heated substrates, the preferential out-of-plane growth orientation is (00l). The FWHMs of (006) and (0015) diffraction peak are increased to be ~ 0.5 and 0.8, probably due to the high density of periodic nano-sized lamella structures parallel with the film surface, as shown in Fig. 1(e). All deposited films are Bi-enriched relative to the stoichiometric Bi2Te3, thus the main diffraction peaks are characterized by some shifts from the sputtering target and the standard Bi2Te3 XRD patterns [12].",
                "The dependence of Seebeck coefficient (α) and electrical conductivity (σ) of the films on the temperatures from RT to 473 K is shown in Fig. 4. One can see that the in-plane electrical conductivity of the deposited films exhibits typical metallic-like transport properties, which decreases with the rising temperature caused by the well-known carrier-defect and carrier-phonon scattering effects. The in-plane Seebeck coefficients of all deposited films are negative, presenting the n-type electron carrier transport mechanism. The values of | α | increase with the temperatures, which can be well understood by the behaviors of α in heavily doped degenerate semiconductors regime [13]. The carrier concentration for the (015) textured films is ~ 8–9 × 1020 cm− 3 and the mobility is as low as 6 cm2/Vs. The carrier concentrations in all (00l) textured films lower to ~ 5–6 × 1020 cm− 3. More interestingly, the carrier mobility of the WOM films is ~ 30 cm2/Vs, which exhibits about 2-fold increase, comparing to the values of the RSM films. The corresponding power factors of the deposited films are also summarized in Fig. 4. The (00l) textured WOM films have the highest power factor values from RT to 473 K, owing to the very high electrical conductivities. It is worthy to note that the power factors of the WOM films are comparable with those of the films deposited at temperatures higher than 573 K in previous reports [10]. However, the carrier concentrations in all films are almost one order magnitude higher than the optimal carrier concentration in the Bi2Te3 alloy system [13], which generates the relative small Seebeck coefficients and lowered power factors in the present work. The high carrier concentration may be ascribed to the deviation of the film composition without control from the Bi2Te3 stoichiometry and the formation of crystal defects at low deposition temperatures (Te vacancy is the dominant donor defect).",
                "We now briefly discuss the formation mechanism of the Bi2Te3 films deposited by the UBMS system. UBMS is an exceptionally versatile technique which is broadly used for the deposition of high-quality and well-adhered films of a wide range of materials [14]. The fundamental principles of UBMS could lead to the unique microstructures and thermoelectric properties of the Bi2Te3 films, which are seldom reported in the literatures. In UBMS deposition process, the substrate is placed in a region of high plasma density. Thus, a high flux of coating atoms can flow toward to the substrate. Furthermore, the ratio of the fluxes of ions and condensing atoms incident at the substrate are much greater than those in the CMS process. Consequently, high energetic particles are delivered to the substrate in the UBMS system, which plays a critical role in determining the structures and properties of the growing film. In the well-known structure zone model (SZM), the homologous temperature, Ts/Tm (where Ts is the substrate temperature), is widely used to describe the thermal induced mobility of the deposition atoms. Due to the inherent intense bombardment effects, the microstructures of the deposited films are strongly affected by both thermal and bombardment induced mobility of the adatoms at the growing film surface. It is generally accepted that, in terms of homologous temperature, the positions of the zonal boundaries relating to the UBMS system are lower than those predicted by the SZM model. Numerous experimental and modeling works on the influence of the growth parameters on the microstructures and morphologies of the films are widely reported. Consequently, the growth mechanisms can be attributed to the combined effects of the nature of chemical bonding, surface/interface energy, strain/stress and/or thermal driven diffusion. However, the Bi2Te3 growing films fabricated by the UBMS technique are simultaneously bombarded by the energetic particles. Therefore, it is still a big challenge to build a detailed growth mechanism to analyze the microstructures and surface morphologies formation during the film growth. In general, the ratio of number of atoms deposited on the surface versus number of atoms ready to diffuse is the controlling factor to the film microstructures and morphologies. In this study, although the deposition rate is higher than 5 μm/h, the compact Bi2Te3 films with (015) oriented columnar microstructures can still be grown even on non-heated substrate. There is no obvious nanoporous structure, and the average grain size in the (015) textured film is ~ 2–3 times larger than that fabricated by alternative PVD techniques using the similar substrate temperatures. This is derived from the energetic bombardment of the film surface during deposition process which can enhance the atomic diffusion to form fully dense structures at relatively low substrate temperatures. When the incident particles are deposited on the substrate surface, the adatoms can diffuse on the surface to grow up to energetically favorable crystal orientations/microstructures. At higher homologous temperatures, the adatoms obtain enough energy to overcome the diffusion barrier to form (00l) textures on the 400 K heated substrate under the assistance of the bombardment effect. The (00l) textures are believed to have the lowest surface energy and are the dominant orientation in the Bi2Te3 films prepared by CMS and PLD techniques at substrate temperature ~ 523 K or higher. These experimental results are consistent with Kelly-Arnell's SZM, in which the homologous temperature Ts/Tm in the present study is depicted in the range of Zone-2 proposed for UBMS systems [15]. It is realized that the effect of the bombardment induced diffusion strongly depends on the incident angle [16]. We thus proposed that the incidence angle is highly depended on the spatial distribution of the magnetic field and/or plasma region in this study. In fact, for the samples located at the center of the sample holder (the target and holder are coaxial), the incident angle could be too small. Accordingly, it is believed that both the thermal and bombardment induced surface diffusions of adatoms are isotropic and responsible for the formation of RSM. While, the WOM films with some given lateral growth directions are attributed to the oblique incidence of the deposition particle flux, which are positioned away from the holder center. At meantime, the bombardment enhanced oriented diffusion has to compete with the isotropic thermal diffusion to generate WOM. The process of the microstructural evolution is rather complicated and highly depends on the incident particle energy, angle and flux [17]. Further investigations are indeed required to clarify the dependence of the film microstructures/morphologies on the characteristics of the UBMS in our future work. The growing process could be dictated by the “singular surface” growth mechanism, where the directional surface diffusion of adatoms plays an important role. A schematic of the proposed growth mechanism of the Bi2Te3 films with well-ordered microstructures is shown in the Fig. S1.",
                "The (00l) textured microstructure can benefit the carrier transport along the ab-plane and provide a high in-plane electrical conductivity [7]. All (00l) textured films have very similar carrier concentrations and the corresponding Seebeck coefficients, which can be predicted by the simple models of electron transport. However, the electrical conductivity of the WOM films is about 2-fold of the value of the RSM films, owing to the higher carrier mobility. It is also worth noting that, although the carrier concentration of WOM films is about ~ 5 times higher than that of the (00l) textured Bi2Te3 films reported in literatures, their carrier mobility are quite comparable (or even higher) [3] and [10]. The formation of low-angle boundaries in the WOM films can rationally account for the suppression of scattering on the carrier transport and high electrical conductivity in this work [3]. Besides, there is no obvious difference of the Seebeck coefficients between the RSM and WOM films. Maybe this is because the low-angle grain boundaries are generally considered as low-energy barrier and no energy filtering effects could be expected on the Seebeck coefficients [18]. The carrier concentration of the WOM film is almost one order magnitude higher than that of the best doping level in the Bi2Te3 alloys. The Seebeck coefficients decrease dramatically with the increased carrier concentration, thus the corresponding power factor is not optimized in this work. To further improve the thermoelectric properties of the Bi2Te3 films, further work should be concentrated to finely control the composition and the well-ordered microstructures using UBMS technique in future.",
                "In summary, we first reveal the Bi2Te3 films with good crystallinity can be deposited by UBMS technique at relative low temperatures. This work experimentally synthesized fully dense (015) and (00l) textured Bi2Te3 films with thickness up to ~ 20 μm on SiO2/Si substrates utilizing high deposition rate. Due to the inherent bombardment effects of the UBMS technique, the (00l) textured films with in-plane well-ordered microstructures are fabricated at much low heated-temperature, in which the low-angle grain boundaries are predominant. The LGBs have been demonstrated to efficiently suppress the scattering on the carrier transport and significantly improve the electrical conductivity, as well as enhance the thermoelectric performance by a factor of ~ 2, comparing to the RSM films with only out-of-plane ordering. The present work also highlights the UBMS technique is a very versatile and promising route to fabricate both in-plane and out-of-plane well-ordered Bi2Te3-based alloys for remarkably enhanced thermoelectric performance.",
