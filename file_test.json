                "We report the encapsulation of the antiferromagnetic and magnetoelectric oxide Cr2O3 inside both multi - and single-walled carbon nanotubes. This is achieved by a two step post-synthesis filling process which involves the filling of nanotubes with CrO3 either from aqueous solution or from the molten phase, followed by appropriate annealing sequences. TEM imaging confirms significant filling rates for both multi- and single-walled carbon nanotubes. Analytical transmission electron microscopy implies that after secondary annealing Cr2O3 is formed inside the nanotubes."

        "Encapsulating magnetic materials in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and thereby coupling the functionality of the nanoscale magnetic materials with that of the CNT is highly desired for a diverse range of future applications. The magnetic filling in CNT is particularly relevant in spintronics where magnetic field, electric field and possibly strain guided applications for magnetically functionalized nanotubes can give rise to novel nano-spintronic devices.",
        "Here, we exploit the feasibility of endohedral functionalization of CNT by means of the technologically relevant Cr2O3, thereby merging the fields of magnetoelectrics and intrinsically nanoscaled core-shell materials. Cr2O3 is a well explored antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator and a prototypical magnetoelectric (ME) compound, having the ability to exhibit electric field induced magnetization or magnetic field induced electric polarization. Due to this reason, Cr2O3 has been extensively studied in the past and in recent years, with the focus aiming to explore its utility as a spintronic material. Interestingly, Cr2O3 was also studied regarding the possibility of piezomagnetism, i.e. wherein applied stress results in a spontaneous magnetic moment. Thus nanoscaled carbon-shielded Cr2O3 is interesting from both fundamental and application point of view.",
        "The concentric multi-walled and single wall carbon nanotubes (MWNT/ SWNT) used in the filling process were synthesized by usual aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition technique and laser ablation respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were performed using a FEI Tecnai F30 TEM/STEM microscope operated at 300 kV accelerating voltage. In addition, the scanning TEM-high angle annular dark field (STEM-HAADF) imaging mode was used to visualize the oxide filling. Analytical characterization was done by means of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in the STEM mode. We have also obtained EELS data from the bulk CrO3 and Cr2O3 samples procured from Sigma Aldrich, for comparison.",
        "CrO3 is a strong oxidant and often used as catalyst in chemical industries and previously there have been efforts to stabilize CrO3 inside CNT using a chemical route. However, in our two step method, first the raw material CrO3 is filled inside the CNT by capillary action, followed by conversion of this filling to the desired oxide by suitable annealing sequences (see Fig. S1 for pristine MWNT). It is to be noted that CrO3 is soluble in water and it also melts at moderately low temperatures of about 200 °C. Thus, capillary action of step-1 is in principle applicable from aqueous solution (wet chemical approach) or the molten phase of CrO3. For wet chemical approach, CrO3 is dissolved in water and the solution is slowly heated up to 125 °C which leads to the filling of the CNT with CrO3. Note, that there are no traces of filling when keeping the CrO3/water solution at room temperature, even for days. In contrast, heating the solution for even very short time periods results in filled CNT. Prior to TEM investigations, the filled CNT were repetitively washed with distilled water so as to remove the residual CrO3. Representative TEM images from several successful trials are shown in Fig. 1. The filling is clearly visible in a bright field TEM (Fig. 1a) and STEM (Fig. 1b) of an individual MWNT. Interestingly, the same filling procedures can be applied for SWNT (Fig. 1c). It was observed that the step 1 did not work when the ratio of the respective mass fractions of CrO3 and CNT was significantly above a critical ratio of 20. Another crucial parameter is the temperature which can be up to 125 °C during the step 1 of wet chemical process. Beyond these critical values, all the CNT in the sample were oxidized and only the crystallites of CrO3 could be traced at the end. (Fig. S2, supplementary data). The alternative post-synthesis filling route involves a molten state procedure where a mixture of CNT and CrO3 was heated (inside vacuum sealed quartz tube) near the melting temperature of CrO3 for time periods lasting up to several days (Fig. 1d). The characterization by EELS showed no differences in the filling obtained either by the wet chemical method or using molten CrO3. However, for melting route, heating the mixture in air destroyed the CNT and in most trails, no traces of CNT were found at the end. The experiments hence imply that for step 1, the wet chemical route is simpler than the molten phase, as no prolonged heating time periods under vacuum are required. Fig. 2 summarizes the steps involved in both procedures. The filling efficiency in case of capillary action can be up to 50%, though in our case we have not done any specific measurements to determine it. However, the overview TEM image of filled MWNT in samples prepared in different batches is similar to what is shown in Fig. S3.",
        "The conversion of the filling into the desired Cr2O3 phase is done by a secondary treatment as step 2. The filled CNT(after step 1) are further annealed at 400 °C as bulk CrO3 is known to convert to Cr2O3 at or above this temperature (Fig. 2). While it is possible to convert bulk CrO3 to Cr2O3 by simply heating in air but when CrO3 is filled inside CNT, this conversion needs to be done under vacuum. Fig. 3 a shows a STEM-HAADF image of a filled CNT after step-2. Surprisingly, the step-2 also results in a significant amount of interlayer filling in between the walls (inset of Fig. 3b and Fig. 3c). The EELS spectrum obtained on the wall-region further confirms that the interlayer filling still constitutes of chromium and oxygen (Fig. 3b).",
        "We investigated a variety of individual filled CNT (after step 2) by means of EELS. A representative spectrum is shown in Fig. 4. Here, the onset of the O-K edge of each spectrum is aligned to the O-K EELS energy loss value of 532 eV. The data in Fig. 4 clearly shows that the EELS response of the annealed filling inside the MWNT is comparable to that of bulk Cr2O3. The L-edges appear at the same energies relative to the O-K peak and the shapes as well as peaks heights of O-K, Cr-L 3, and Cr-L 2 excitations are very similar to the bulk Cr2O3 spectrum. The observed energy difference between the onset of Cr-L 3 edges of bulk CrO3 and Cr2O3 in Fig. 4 was ∼4.5 eV. This is in good agreement with previously reported energy difference (ΔECr L 3-O K) between the O-K and Cr-L 3 edges, for CrO3 (+6) and Cr2O3 (+3) EELS spectra to be in the range of 4.4-5.6 eV. Also, the mismatch between EELS spectra features of the annealed filling and bulk CrO3 is clearly apparent in Fig. 4. Our EELS data therefore provide evidence that the filling inside CNT after step 2 is Cr2O3.",
        "Our results hence show the feasibility of filling antiferromagnetic and magnetoelectric Cr2O3 inside CNT, thereby fabricating intrinsically nanoscaled functional material which is shielded by a protecting carbon shell and may exhibit tunability of magnetism with applied magnetic fields as well as electric fields."
