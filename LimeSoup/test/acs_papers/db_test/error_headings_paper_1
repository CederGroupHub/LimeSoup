0 Chiral polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) display variable atropisomeric enrichment in wildlife and animal models, especially at higher trophic levels. These differences in PCBs’ chiral signatures are, at least in part, due to species-dependent oxidation of PCBs to hydroxylated PCB metabolites (OH-PCBs). Here, we investigate the hypothesis that the cytochrome P450 (P450) enzyme-mediated oxidation of chiral PCBs results in species-dependent differences in the chiral signatures of OH-PCBs (i.e., the direction and extent of OH-PCBs’ atropisomeric enrichment). To investigate this hypothesis, we incubated PCB 136, a representative chiral PCB, with pooled human liver microsomes (HLMs) or liver microsomes from male guinea pig, hamster, monkey, mouse, and rabbit or female dog and determined average profiles and chiral signatures of the OH-PCBs. 2,2′,3,3′,6,6′-Hexachlorobiphenyl-4-ol (4–136) was the major metabolite in incubations with HLMs and monkey and rabbit microsomes. 2,2′,3,3′,6,6′-Hexachlorobiphenyl-5-ol (5–136) was the major metabolite formed by microsomes from all other species. Both 4–136 and 5–136 were formed atropselectively in all microsomal incubations; however, the direction and extent of the atropisomeric enrichment of both OH-PCB metabolites showed considerable differences across microsomal preparations obtained from different species. These differences in OH-PCBs’ atropisomeric enrichment may not only be toxicologically relevant but may also be useful to study sources and transport of OH-PCBs in the environment.

1 Figure 1. The time-dependent formation of (A) 3–150, (B) 5–136, (C) 4–136, (D) 4, 5–136, and (E) ΣOH-136 followed the rank order (+)-PCB 136 > (±)-PCB 136 > (−)-PCB 136 in incubations with human liver microsomes. (F) The relative rates of OH-PCB formation showed a significantly slower metabolite formation in the incubations with (−)-PCB 136 compared to incubations with (+)-PCB 136 and (±)-PCB 136. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences in the OH-PCB formation rates (p < 0.05) as determined by a Tukey student range test using SAS. *p = 0.05 for comparison of the 4,5–136 formation rates between incubations with (+)- and (−)-PCB 136. The values are mean ± standard deviation (n = 3).

2 Figure 2. Time- and species-dependent formation of OH-PCBs in incubations of PCB 136 with liver microsomes from (A) humans (pooled), (B) dog, (C) monkey, (D) guinea pig, (E) mouse, (F) hamster, and (G) rabbit. 4–136 was the major metabolite in incubations using human, monkey and rabbit liver microsomes. 5–136 was the major metabolite in experiments with dog, guinea pig, mouse, and hamster liver microsomes. The 1,2-shift metabolite, 3–150, was only observed in incubations using human and monkey liver microsomes. The values are mean ± standard deviation (n = 3).

3 Figure 3. Comparison of the formation rates of (A) 5–136 and (B) 4–136 in incubations with liver microsomes obtained from different species. The rat data were taken from ref 30. Metabolites formation rates are adjusted by total P450 content. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences in the OH-PCB formation rates (p < 0.05) as determined by a Tukey student range test using SAS. The values are mean ± standard deviation (n = 3). The formation rate of 4–136 was significantly different from that of 5–136 within each species (p < 0.05; paired t test).

(A) Representive chromatograms showing an enrichment of the second eluting 5–136 atropisomer in incubations with human (pooled), dog, monkey, guinea pig, and rabbit liver microsomes and an enrichment of the first eluting 5–136 atropisomer in experiments with mouse and hamster liver microsomes. (B) Representive chromatograms showing an enrichment of the second eluting 4–136 atropisomer in incubations with human (pooled), dog, monkey, guinea pig, hasmster, and rabbit liver microsomes and an enrichment of the first eluting 4–136 atropisomer in experiments with mouse liver microsomes. Enantiomeric fractions of (C) 5–136 and (D) 4–136. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences in the EF values (p < 0.05) as determined by a Tukey student range test using SAS. *EF values significantly different from control (p < 0.05, paired t test). #EF values of 4–136 in incubations with dog microsomes showed a trend to significance from control (p = 0.054). The values are mean ± standard deviation (n = 3).
