From Soup: 0 We welcome Professor Brent S. Sumerlin to the Editorial Board of Polymer Chemistry. Professor Sumerlin graduated with a B.S. from North Carolina State University (1998) and obtained a PhD in Polymer Science and Engineering at the University of Southern Mississippi (2003) under the direction of Prof. Charles L. McCormick. After serving as a Visiting Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University under the direction of Prof. Krzysztof Matyjaszewski (2003–2005), he joined the Department of Chemistry at Southern Methodist University (Dallas, Texas, USA) as an assistant professor in 2005 and was promoted to associate professor in 2009. Professor Sumerlin has received several awards, including an Oak Ridge Associated Universities Ralph E. Powe Award (2007), an NSF CAREER Award (2009), an ACS Leadership Development Award (2010), and an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship (2010). He is a member of the editorial advisory boards for Polymer and the Journal of Macromolecular Science, Pure & Applied Chemistry. Current research in his group involves the synthesis of functional macromolecules, responsive polymer systems, polymer–protein bioconjugates, and dynamic covalent macromolecular assemblies.
