From cou.: 1 The heterobimetallic complex [Cu(II)Mn(III)(L)2(py)4](ClO4)·EtOH (1) built using the pro-ligand 2,2′-biphenol (LH2), contains a rare example of a Jahn–Teller compressed Mn(III) centre. Dc magnetic susceptibility measurements on 1 reveal a strong antiferromagnetic exchange between the Cu(II) and Mn(III) ions mediated through the phenolate O-atoms (J = −33.4 cm−1), with magnetisation measurements at low temperatures and high fields suggesting significant anisotropy. Simulations of high-field and high frequency powder EPR data suggest a single-ion anisotropy DMn(III) = +4.45 cm−1. DFT calculations also yield an antiferromagnetic exchange for 1, though the magnitude is overestimated (JDFT = −71 cm−1). Calculations reveal that the antiferromagnetic interaction essentially stems from the Mn(dx2−y2)–Cu(dx2−y2) interaction. The computed single-ion anisotropy and cluster anisotropy also correlates well with experiment. A larger cluster anisotropy for the S = 3/2 state compared to the single-ion anisotropy of Mn(III) is rationalised on the basis of orbital mixing and various contributions that arise due to the spin–orbit interaction.

In bioinorganic chemistry certain heterometallic manganese complexes have been proposed as biomimetic models for energy and electron transfer processes – one such stimulus being the [Mn4CaO4] cubane-like catalytic unit within photosystem II (PSII).1 Mn has also played a pivotal role in the field of molecular magnetism: the anisotropic nature of the Mn(III) ion means that it is regularly selected as the metal of choice in the synthesis of Single-Molecule Magnets (SMMs)2 and Single-Chain Magnets (SCMs),3 whilst the isotropic Mn(II) ion can be employed in the construction of molecular magnetic refrigerants.4 Molecular Nanomagnetism has also seen a renaissance in the synthesis of heterometallic 3d/4f cluster compounds, driven, in the main, by the tunable anisotropy of the lanthanide ions,5,6 offering the chemist the opportunity to vary the physical properties of a molecule without significantly altering structure. Similarly the systematic synthesis of the extensive family of heterometallic [Cr7M] wheels and their many siblings has made elegant in-roads into the field of quantum information processing via molecular qubits.7

From cou.: 3 The dissemination of these wonderfully elaborate and complex polynuclear heterometallic architectures was of course preceded by fundamental studies of the magnetic exchange between metal ions in very simple complexes, such as homo- and hetereometallic dimers. An early example of this was the heterobimetallic complex [CuVO(fsa)2en] (where (fsa)2en4− is the ligand derived from N,N′-(2-hydroxy-3-carboxybenzylidene)-1,2-diaminoethane) in which the nature of the intramolecular ferromagnetic exchange was explained by the orthogonality of the magnetic orbitals centred on the Cu(II) and V(IV) ions.8 More recently the heterodinuclear complex [Cu(II)Mn(III)Cl(5-Br-sap)2(MeOH)] (where 5-Br-sap = 5-bromo-2-salicylideneamino-1-propanol) was shown to exhibit ferromagnetic exchange, with the magnetic anisotropy stemming from the presence of the single Jahn–Teller elongated Mn(III) ion conferring SMM behaviour.9

From cou.: 6 The structure of the cation in 1 (Fig. 1) comprises a single distorted square planar Cu(II) ion (Cu1) linked to a single six coordinate Jahn–Teller compressed Mn(III) ion (Mn1) by two bridging Ophen donor atoms (Mn1–O1–Cu1, 99.72°; Mn1–O3–Cu1, 101.28°) belonging to two distinct doubly deprotonated 2,2′-biphenolate ligands. Their remaining Ophen atoms (O2 and O4) are terminally bonded, providing the short axial bonds to the sole Mn(III) ion that define the Jahn–Teller compressed axis (Mn1–O2, 1.880 Å; Mn1–O4, 1.871 Å). The longer equatorial bonds range between 2.051 Å (Mn1–O3) and 2.205 Å (Mn1–N4). The “free” axial sites of the square planar Cu(II) ion are blocked by the presence of the phenyl rings of the rather twisted L2− ligands (Cu⋯Ph(centroid) = 3.560–3.579 Å); indeed the dihedral angles between the Ph rings on these same ligands are 49.86° [C5–C8] and 51.60° [C17–C20] respectively. Four terminal pyridine ligands complete the coordination spheres at the six coordinate Mn(III) centre (N3 and N4) and at the four coordinate Cu(II) site (N1 and N2) affording {MnO4N2} and {CuO2N2} coordination spheres, respectively.

From cou.: 8 Although a number of Cu(II)–Mn(II) dinuclear complexes are known in the literature,11 a CSD search reveals that 1 is one of very few examples to show the Cu(II)–Mn(III) oxidation state distribution,9,12 and is indeed the first to possess a Mn(III) ion exhibiting a Jahn–Teller compression. Complex 1 is structurally very similar to the aforementioned [Cu(II)Mn(III)Cl(5-Br-sap)2(MeOH)] (2). Both contain [Cu(II)(OR)2Mn(III)] magnetic cores (albeit with different R-groups), resulting in very similar Cu(II)–O(R)–Mn(III) bond angles (99.71 and 101.26° in 1) and (102.1° in 2). Indeed the only difference in terms of magnetic structure is the presence of a Jahn–Teller compressed Mn(III) ion in 1 and a Jahn–Teller elongated Mn(III) ion in 2. The synthesis of 1 therefore represents an ideal opportunity to investigate the magneto-structural relationship in this family of complexes (vide infra).

From cou.: 9 Dc magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed on a powdered microcrystalline sample of 1 in an applied magnetic field of 0.1 T and in the temperature range 250 to 5 K. The results are plotted as the χMT product vs. T in the top panel of Fig. 2. The high temperature χMT value of 2.270 cm3 K mol−1 is lower than that expected from the spin-only value (3.375 cm3 K mol−1) for non-interacting high-spin Mn(III) (3d4) and Cu(II) (3d9) ions, assuming g = 2. This reflects the existence of a strong intramolecular antiferromagnetic interaction in 1. The χMT product decreases in a sigmoidal-like fashion with decreasing temperature until it reaches a plateau of around 1.75 cm3 K mol−1 in the 45 to 20 K temperature interval. The χMT product at this low temperature plateau is consistent with the existence of a thermally isolated S = 3/2 spin-state. For the modelling of the χMT product we used spin-Hamiltonian (1):where J is the Cu(II)–Mn(III) isotropic exchange interaction parameter, Ŝ is a spin-operator, DMn is the single-ion uniaxial anisotropy of Mn(III), S = 2 is the single-ion spin of Mn(III), μB is the Bohr magneton, gMn = 2.0 and gCu = 2.1 are the employed isotropic g-factors of the Mn(III) and Cu(II) ions, respectively, andis the applied magnetic field vector. The χMT product of 1 was numerically fitted by use of the simplex algorithm13 to spin-Hamiltonian (1) by numerical diagonalisation of the spin-Hamiltonian matrix of dimension 10 by 10. While fitting the χMT product, it became apparent that inclusion of the Mn(III) single-ion anisotropy term does not significantly improve the quality of fit, as measured by the χ2 statistics. This is as expected since anisotropy effects are predominant at very low temperatures and thus, do not weight significantly in the fitting of the χMT product. The best-fit parameter of (1) to the χMT product of 1 was J = −33.4 cm−1, affording an S = 3/2 spin ground state with the S = 5/2 excited state some 167 cm−1 higher in energy. In addition, inter-molecular interactions were taken into account in the frame of mean-field theory, by use of the Curie–Weiss temperature, θ. A Curie–Weiss constant of θ = −0.9 K, was necessary to reproduce the small drop of the χMT product below ∼20 K. The determined strong antiferromagnetic interaction is consistent with the above qualitative description of the thermal dependence of the χMT product of 1.
From Soup: 9 Dc magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed on a powdered microcrystalline sample of 1 in an applied magnetic field of 0.1 T and in the temperature range 250 to 5 K. The results are plotted as the χ M T product vs. T in the top panel of Fig. 2 . The high temperature χ M T value of 2.270 cm 3 K mol −1 is lower than that expected from the spin-only value (3.375 cm 3 K mol −1 ) for non-interacting high-spin Mn( III ) (3d 4 ) and Cu( II ) (3d 9 ) ions, assuming g = 2.

From cou.: 10 In order to determine, by magnetisation measurements, the single-ion axial anisotropy parameter for the Mn(III) centre in 1, variable-temperature-variable-field magnetisation measurements were performed in the T = 2.0–7.0 K and B = 0.5–7.0 T temperature and dc magnetic field ranges, respectively. These experimental data are presented as reduced magnetisation (M/NμBvs. μBB/kT, with N being Avogadro's number and k the Boltzmann constant) in the lower panel of Fig. 2. They were again numerically fitted, by use of the simplex algorithm,13 to spin-Hamiltonian (1), by numerical diagonalisation of the 10 by 10 spin-Hamiltonian matrix. The best fit parameter, keeping J fixed to −33.4 cm−1 (as determined by fitting the χMT product), was DMn = +4.95 cm−1. Forcing the DMn parameter to vary only in the negative-value semi-axis, leads to χ2 values that are two orders of magnitude higher than the ones obtained by letting DMn vary freely to give DMn = +4.95 cm−1. The positive value of DMn is in good agreement with the axially compressed nature of the coordination sphere of the Mn(III) ion.

From cou.: 11 Powder EPR data were collected for complex 1 in order to determine the magnetic anisotropy of the dimer. Given the spin states of the constituent ions (S = 2 and 1/2 for Mn(III) and Cu(II) respectively), one expects a half integer ground state spin of either S = 3/2 or 5/2 for the dimer. The low-energy spectrum should thus consist of either two or three [i.e. (2S + 1)] Kramers doublets, split by any associated magnetic anisotropy. Fig. 3 displays representative frequency-dependent powder EPR spectra for complex 1 collected between 100.6 and 406 GHz at a relatively low temperature of 5 K. All of the labelled resonances persist to the lowest temperatures investigated (not shown), indicating that they involve transitions either within or from the lowest Kramers doublet. At frequencies below 200 GHz, the spectra are dominated by three strong resonance branches that we assign to the x, y and z-transitions within the ground-state Kramers doublet; these are marked by open red, blue and black circles, respectively. As can be seen in the frequency versus field map in Fig. 4, the peak positions corresponding to these transitions each lie on simulated curves (vide infra) that intersect the origin, as expected for intra-Kramers transitions. At frequencies above 200 GHz, additional resonance branches appear at low fields (solid black squares and circles). As can be seen in Fig. 4, these resonances all lie on lines/curves that meet at a unique finite-frequency offset on the zero-field axis. We thus assign them as inter-Kramers transitions, and the intercept on the ordinate corresponds exactly to the zero-field energy splitting between the two lowest Kramers doublets. We note that this splitting of 381 ± 5 GHz is rather substantial for a complex comprised of just Mn(III) and Cu(II) ions. The solid circles in Fig. 4 correspond to the usual Δms = ±1 perpendicular-mode EPR transitions, while the solid squares correspond to Δms = ±2 resonances (see below). The simulations assume that the applied field, B, is parallel to z. However, all three inter-Kramers components (i.e. B//x, y and z) generate Δms = ±1 and ±2 resonances at similar locations, provided the applied field is relatively weak (<3 T), which may account for the appreciable intensity of the lowest field 406.4 GHz peak in Fig. 3.

From cou.: 12 While analysis of susceptibility data enables reliable estimates of the exchange coupling within a simple spin system, especially a dimer, EPR measurements provide much more robust constraints on both the sign and magnitude of the magneto-anisotropy. The EPR data presented in Fig. 4 clearly reveal the presence of a pair of low-energy Kramers doublets. However, they do not rule out the possibility of a third higher-lying doublet. Thus, a determination of the ground state spin from the EPR data is not entirely straightforward. This would require careful analysis of much weaker transitions observed at elevated temperatures, and we do not pursue this here because the susceptibility measurements clearly indicate that the coupling within the dimer is antiferromagnetic. Therefore, in the following analysis, we assume that the ground state spin value is S = 3/2. In doing so, we will see that the obtained anisotropy is quite consistent with expectations, thus providing indirect confirmation of the S = 3/2 ground state spin value.

From cou.: 13 We first turn our attention to the sign of the second-order axial zero-field splitting parameter DS associated with the S = 3/2 ground state. In the presence of easy-plane type anisotropy (DS > 0), the B//x- and y-components of the spectrum associated with the lowest Kramers doublet (red and blue circles, respectively, Fig. 4) possess effective g-values that are substantially larger than 2.00, i.e. slopes that substantially exceed 28 GHz T−1 as B → 0; meanwhile, the B//z-component has an effective g-value (slope) very close to 2.00 (or 28 GHz T−1, denoted by the grey line in Fig. 4). The opposite holds for the easy-axis case (D < 0).14,15 Thus, the powder EPR data clearly support the presence of an easy-plane type anisotropy (D > 0), which one would expect in a JT compressed Mn(III) system, since this represents the main source of anisotropy within the dimer. The magnitude of DS is approximately constrained by the intercept of the inter-Kramers resonance branches. For a purely axial system, this intercept corresponds exactly to 2DS, hence DS ≈ 381/2 GHz = 6.35 cm−1. However, as can clearly be seen from Fig. 3 and 4, there is a considerable splitting between the x and y components of the spectrum, signifying a rhombic distortion and, hence, a rhombic ES parameter. In such situations, DS can only be determined precisely via diagonalisation of the following effective spin Hamiltonian:
From Soup: 13 We first turn our attention to the sign of the second-order axial zero-field splitting parameter D S associated with the S = 3/2 ground state.

For a purely axial system, this intercept corresponds exactly to 2 D S , hence D S ≈ 381/2 GHz = 6.35 cm −1 . However, as can clearly be seen from Fig. 3 and 4 , there is a considerable splitting between the x and y components of the spectrum, signifying a rhombic distortion and, hence, a rhombic E S parameter. In such situations, D S can only be determined precisely via diagonalisation of the following effective spin Hamiltonian:

From cou.: 44 The transverse anisotropy (E) leads naturally to an avoided-crossing between the mS = −3/2 and mS = +1/2 components of the two Kramers doublets, which meet at ∼7 T when B//z. It is this interaction that is the reason for the ∼60 GHz (2 cm−1) gap between the inter- and intra-Kramers z-component resonance branches at ∼7 T in Fig. 4 (solid black lines). Surprisingly, spectra recorded at frequencies close to 200 GHz (e.g. the blue curve in Fig. 3) still show weak resonances in this gapped region of the B//z simulations. Closer inspection of the spectra reveals that the z component appears to consist of a narrow derivative (i.e. a sharp peak followed by a sharp minimum) superimposed on a broad dip; this contrasts the x and y components that each consist of a single feature, i.e. a peak for y and a shoulder for x, as expected for such a powder spectrum. The narrow and broad z-components are separately plotted in Fig. 4 as grey squares and open black circles. The sharp components lie on a straight (grey) line passing through the origin, having a slope corresponding to g = 2.003(2). At most frequencies, the broad dip lies very close to this line. However, one clearly sees that the broad component moves appreciably to the high-field side of the g = 2.003 position (the sharp peak) as the frequency approaches the gapped region; the relevant portion of the 148.8 GHz spectrum has been enlarged in Fig. 3 (green curve) to emphasize this point. Indeed, if one assumes that it is this broad dip that corresponds to the z-component of the dimer spectrum, one finds excellent agreement with the simulations in Fig. 4. Meanwhile, we believe that the sharp component corresponds to an impurity phase within the powder, possibly containing isotropic Mn(II); this is often found to be the case in Mn-containing polynuclear clusters, and explains why a resonance is still observed in the gapped region of the B//z spectrum. In fact, it is notable that the 200 GHz spectrum exhibits only a sharp component, the broad dip appears to be absent, which is why an open circle is not included in Fig. 4 for this frequency.

The projection method gives, whereandare the anisotropy tensors of the ground spin-state and the Mn(III) ion, respectively. Therefore, we estimate that DMn = +4.45 cm−1 and EMn = ±0.41 cm−1. We note that these zero-field interaction parameters obtained via EPR data are in excellent agreement with the parameters obtained via the reduced magnetisation measurements, and are consistent with values found for related single-ion Mn(III) compounds (see Table S3† and references therein).17 Finally, we comment on the g-values obtained from the EPR measurements. Again, using projection methods, one can estimate that. Consequently, the obtained g-values for the S = 3/2 ground spin-state should be dominated by the Mn(III) ion, which is consistent with the obtained values that are very close to 2.00.

From Soup: 76 The spin density values on the Mn( III ) (1.663) and Cu( II ) (0.59) ions clearly indicates strong spin delocalisation to other atoms. The spin densities on the bridging O-atoms (O1 and O3) are found to be positive (0.11 and 0.12) while the N-atoms coordinated to Cu( II ) and Mn( III ) are also found to have positive spin densities. On the other hand, the spin densities on the O-atoms lying in the axial direction are found to be negative ( Fig. 6 ). This is in line with our expectation where the empty d z 2 orbital propagates spin polarization rather than spin delocalization. Such a mixture of delocalization and polarization has been reported previously. 19 c ,22

From Soup: 77 We have also computed the ZFS parameter of complex 1 using the methodology established by Neese et al . 21 We have performed calculations on complex 1 and also on a fictitious {MnZn} model complex of 1 to estimate the S = 3/2 ZFS of 1 and the S = 2 single-ion anisotropy of the Mn( III ) ion, in order to compare to the experimentally extracted parameters. The calculated single-ion anisotropy of the Mn( III ) ion is +1.94 cm −1 , while the cluster anisotropy is computed to be +2.35 cm −1 . The HF-EPR estimates of the ZFS are +4.45 and +6.27 cm −1 , respectively. Our DFT calculations reproduce the sign and the trend correctly, but clearly underestimate the magnitude quite considerably. Such underestimation by DFT methods has been well documented: accurate reproduction demands inclusion of exited state contributions and this is possible only by means of ab initio calculations. 21

From Soup: 78 Analysis of the contributions to the net D -tensor suggest the main source arises from spin–orbit coupling ( D SOC ), while the spin–spin contribution ( D SS ) is found to be small, and significantly less than that reported for complexes in which the Mn( III ) ion is Jahn–Teller elongated. 20,21 The significant contributions to the ZFS are listed in Table 1 . For D SOC the spin-flip excitations account for nearly 65% of the contribution. Multiple contributions to the D -tensor listed in Table 1 reveal some distinct differences between the single-ion and the cluster anisotropy. The α → β (spin-up to spin-down) excitations are pronounced for the Mn( III ) single-ion ( S = 2 state) anisotropy, while other contributions are very small. However for the dinuclear {MnCu} compound ( S = 3/2 ground state), very large β → α and α → α contributions were detected, in addition to the expected α → β spin flip. A large β → α and α → α for the antiferromagnetically coupled dimer is expected due to the mixing of Mn III and Cu II d-orbitals. The mixing is evident from the computed overlap integrals and the discussed spin density distribution. An in depth analysis to understand the contribution of various terms to the ZFS can only be obtained through an ab initio CASSCF/PT2 studies. 17d
 ###### 
From cou.: 79 y
From Soup: 79 Analysing the wave function (see Fig. 5 and related discussion on Δ) reveals that the main reason for the difference is that the Mn( III ) ion has one empty α type orbital (for the S = 3/2 ground state) and this leads to large singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) to virtual molecular orbitals (VMO) contribution. There is also a significant contribution due to doubly occupied orbitals (DOMO) to VMO due to the presence of Cu( II ). These two contributions are minimal for the mononuclear Mn( III ) ions. This is illustrated in Fig. 7 . It is apparent from the break-up contributions given for the {MnCu} complex that the DOMO → VMO excitation which has the largest positive value determines the net sign of the anisotropy. Since this parameter is related to the mixing of Mn and Cu d-orbitals, efforts to vary the ligand field are expected to significantly affect the magnitude of the anisotropy. The computed D -tensor orientation for the {MnCu} complex is shown in Fig. 6 . As expected the D zz axis is aligned along JT axis with a deviation of approximately 5° ( Table 2 ).

Complex 1 is a rare example of a dimeric [Cu( II )Mn( III )] cluster compound and the first example to exhibit a Jahn–Teller compressed Mn( III ) centre. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetisation studies conclude that the exchange in 1 is antiferromagnetic resulting in an isolated S = 3/2 ground spin state, with J = −33.4 cm −1 , g = 2.0 and D Mn(III) = +4.95 cm −1 . High-field, high-frequency EPR studies on powdered samples of 1 corroborate these findings, giving rise to the spin Hamiltonian parameters D Mn(III) = +4.45 cm −1 and E Mn(III) = +0.41 cm −1 . DFT calculations offer insights into the mechanism of magnetic coupling where the origin of the antiferromagnetic interaction is related to the nature of the Jahn–Teller distortion. Calculations also yield a reasonable estimate of the anisotropy for complex 1 and explain how the mixing of the Mn( III ) and Cu( II ) d-based orbitals leads to dramatic changes in the sign as well as the magnitude of the anisotropy for 1 .

From cou.: 91 The spin density values on the Mn(III) (1.663) and Cu(II) (0.59) ions clearly indicates strong spin delocalisation to other atoms. The spin densities on the bridging O-atoms (O1 and O3) are found to be positive (0.11 and 0.12) while the N-atoms coordinated to Cu(II) and Mn(III) are also found to have positive spin densities. On the other hand, the spin densities on the O-atoms lying in the axial direction are found to be negative (Fig. 6). This is in line with our expectation where the empty dz2 orbital propagates spin polarization rather than spin delocalization. Such a mixture of delocalization and polarization has been reported previously.19c,22

From cou.: 92 We have also computed the ZFS parameter of complex 1 using the methodology established by Neese et al.21 We have performed calculations on complex 1 and also on a fictitious {MnZn} model complex of 1 to estimate the S = 3/2 ZFS of 1 and the S = 2 single-ion anisotropy of the Mn(III) ion, in order to compare to the experimentally extracted parameters. The calculated single-ion anisotropy of the Mn(III) ion is +1.94 cm−1, while the cluster anisotropy is computed to be +2.35 cm−1. The HF-EPR estimates of the ZFS are +4.45 and +6.27 cm−1, respectively. Our DFT calculations reproduce the sign and the trend correctly, but clearly underestimate the magnitude quite considerably. Such underestimation by DFT methods has been well documented: accurate reproduction demands inclusion of exited state contributions and this is possible only by means of ab initio calculations.21

From cou.: 93 Analysis of the contributions to the net D-tensor suggest the main source arises from spin–orbit coupling (DSOC), while the spin–spin contribution (DSS) is found to be small, and significantly less than that reported for complexes in which the Mn(III) ion is Jahn–Teller elongated.20,21 The significant contributions to the ZFS are listed in Table 1. For DSOC the spin-flip excitations account for nearly 65% of the contribution. Multiple contributions to the D-tensor listed in Table 1 reveal some distinct differences between the single-ion and the cluster anisotropy. The α → β (spin-up to spin-down) excitations are pronounced for the Mn(III) single-ion (S = 2 state) anisotropy, while other contributions are very small. However for the dinuclear {MnCu} compound (S = 3/2 ground state), very large β → α and α → α contributions were detected, in addition to the expected α → β spin flip. A large β → α and α → α for the antiferromagnetically coupled dimer is expected due to the mixing of MnIII and CuII d-orbitals. The mixing is evident from the computed overlap integrals and the discussed spin density distribution. An in depth analysis to understand the contribution of various terms to the ZFS can only be obtained through an ab initio CASSCF/PT2 studies.17d

From cou.: 94 Analysing the wave function (see Fig. 5 and related discussion on Δ) reveals that the main reason for the difference is that the Mn(III) ion has one empty α type orbital (for the S = 3/2 ground state) and this leads to large singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) to virtual molecular orbitals (VMO) contribution. There is also a significant contribution due to doubly occupied orbitals (DOMO) to VMO due to the presence of Cu(II). These two contributions are minimal for the mononuclear Mn(III) ions. This is illustrated in Fig. 7. It is apparent from the break-up contributions given for the {MnCu} complex that the DOMO → VMO excitation which has the largest positive value determines the net sign of the anisotropy. Since this parameter is related to the mixing of Mn and Cu d-orbitals, efforts to vary the ligand field are expected to significantly affect the magnitude of the anisotropy. The computed D-tensor orientation for the {MnCu} complex is shown in Fig. 6. As expected the Dzz axis is aligned along JT axis with a deviation of approximately 5° (Table 2).

From cou.: 95 Reaction of anhydrous CuCl, Mn(ClO4)2·6H2O and 2,2-biphenol (LH2) in an EtOH/pyridine solvent mixture produces the heterobimetallic complex [Cu(II)Mn(III)(L)2(py)4](ClO4)·EtOH (1·EtOH). Complex 1 is a rare example of a dimeric [Cu(II)Mn(III)] cluster compound and the first example to exhibit a Jahn–Teller compressed Mn(III) centre. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetisation studies conclude that the exchange in 1 is antiferromagnetic resulting in an isolated S = 3/2 ground spin state, with J = −33.4 cm−1, g = 2.0 and DMn(III) = +4.95 cm−1. High-field, high-frequency EPR studies on powdered samples of 1 corroborate these findings, giving rise to the spin Hamiltonian parameters DMn(III) = +4.45 cm−1 and EMn(III) = +0.41 cm−1. DFT calculations offer insights into the mechanism of magnetic coupling where the origin of the antiferromagnetic interaction is related to the nature of the Jahn–Teller distortion. Calculations also yield a reasonable estimate of the anisotropy for complex 1 and explain how the mixing of the Mn(III) and Cu(II) d-based orbitals leads to dramatic changes in the sign as well as the magnitude of the anisotropy for 1.

From cou.: 97 DFT calculations combined with the Broken Symmetry (BS) approach24 were employed to compute the J values. The BS method has a proven record of yielding good numerical estimates of J constants for a variety of complexes.25,26 A detailed technical discussion of the computational details can be found elsewhere.27,28 Here, we have performed most of our calculations using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs with the fragment approach.29 We have employed a hybrid B3LYP functional30 with TZV basis sets on all atoms.31 A very tight SCF convergence was employed throughout. DFT calculations for the estimation of the D-tensor used the ORCA suite of programmes,32 employing the non-hybrid BP86 functional33 using quasi-degenerate theory34 with CP approach.35,36 The Alhrichs TZVPPP basis set was used for the Mn(III) and Cu(II) ions, while for the remaining atoms we have used the TZVP basis set. The RI approximations were considered during calculation with auxiliary TZV/J columbic fitting basis set.37 Increased integration grids (Grid 5 in ORCA convention) along with tight SCF convergence were used.
