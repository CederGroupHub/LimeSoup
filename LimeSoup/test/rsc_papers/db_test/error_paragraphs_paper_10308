From cou.: 1 Diffusion is slow. Thus, diffusion experiments are intrinsically time-consuming and laborious. Additionally, the experimental effort is multiplied for multicomponent systems as the determination of multicomponent diffusion coefficients typically requires several experiments. To reduce the experimental effort, we present the first microfluidic diffusion measurement method for multicomponent liquid systems. The measurement setup combines a microfluidic chip with Raman microspectroscopy. Excellent agreement between experimental results and literature data is achieved for the binary system cyclohexane + toluene and the ternary system 1-propanol + 1-chlorobutane + heptane. The Fick diffusion coefficients are obtained from fitting a multicomponent convection-diffusion model to the mole fractions measured in experiments. Ternary diffusion coefficients can be obtained from a single experiment; high accuracy is already obtained from two experiments. Advantages of the presented measurement method are thus short measurement times, reduced sample consumption, and less experiments for the determination of a multicomponent diffusion coefficient.

From cou.: 2 Diffusion is the most important mass transport process on the micro-scale, both in chemistry and biology.1–4 Therefore, the knowledge of diffusion coefficients is indispensable for the design of microfluidic devices,3,5–12 industrial processes, and environmental phenomena.13 Since most applications contain more than two components, multicomponent diffusion coefficients are usually needed. However, there is a lack of data for multicomponent systems:13–15 to date, diffusion coefficients of less than 300 multicomponent systems are published. Less than 30% of these systems are non-aqueous.16 For comparison: the commercial Dortmund Database contains vapor–liquid equilibrium data on more than 2000 multicomponent mixtures.17 Here, more than 60% of the multicomponent mixtures are non-aqueous.

From cou.: 3 The reason for the sparse diffusion data is that diffusion measurements are time-consuming and laborious. Typical measurements last from about an hour up to several days.18 At the same time, these measurements consume sample volumes ranging from a few mL to several 100 mL.18,19 These limitations already apply to binary diffusion. For multicomponent diffusion, repeated experiments are required for a single data point such that the effort of diffusion measurements increases with (nc − 1), where nc denotes the number of components.20 In practice, several times (nc − 1) experiments are performed.21,22 Thus, ternary diffusion experiments take at least twice the effort of binary experiments.

From cou.: 13 The model-based estimation procedure for the diffusion coefficients is based on a mass transport model. For this purpose, we extend the convection–diffusion model for binary mixtures developed by our group27 to multicomponent mixtures.

This assumption is based on the fact that the channel is flat (W ≫ H, see Fig. 1(C)) and that the magnitude of the Reynolds number Re is of order 1.37

From cou.: 14 The diffusion process is continuous and steady-state. Therefore, the length coordinate s (Fig. 1(A)) is proportional to an average contact time. Convection dominates the mass transport in length-direction s (Péclet number Pe > 100), while diffusion dominates the mass transport in the y–z cross-sectional plane. Furthermore, we average the concentrations over the z-direction because concentrations are smoothed out by diffusion much faster in z-direction than in y-direction due to the high aspect ratio (W ≫ H).

From Soup: 44 The IHM analysis of the binary system cyclohexane + toluene yields a very small root mean square error for the mole fractions RMSE cal ( x i ) = 0.12 mol% as determined from repeated measurements. Typical Raman spectra for the inlet solutions of the system cyclohexane + toluene are shown in Fig. 4(A) , which correspond to mole fractions of x cyclohexane = 58.5 mol% and x cyclohexane = 61.5 mol%. Since the concentration difference between the inlets is reduced during the diffusion process, all spectra obtained in the microchannel lie in-between these spectra. A very low RMSE cal was still achieved as the Raman spectra of cyclohexane and toluene provide several distinctive peaks and the integrated areas of the pure components are of similar size ( Fig. 4(B) ). All bands in the spectral range from 500 cm −1 to 1800 cm −1 were considered in the IHM analysis.

From cou.: 45 i
From Soup: 45 For the ternary system 1-propanol + 1-chlorobutane + heptane, an error of the mole fractions of RMSE cal ( x i ) = 0.5 mol% was obtained within the mole fraction range of 1-propanol and 1-chlorobutane from 30.8 mol% to 35.8 mol%. The spectra at the channel inlets for series A and series B are shown in Fig. 3(A) . The shown spectra are typical for this mole fraction range. The higher uncertainty for the ternary system compared to the binary system results from overlapping characteristic spectral bands of the pure components ( Fig. 3(B) ) and the resulting more difficult assigning of components in the spectral analysis. The spectral analysis by IHM considered all spectral bands from 500 cm −1 to 1600 cm −1 .

From cou.: 46 j
From Soup: 46 The mole fractions x i ,meas are the input to the parameter estimation procedure for the diffusion coefficient D V . The parameter estimation is based on a maximum likelihood procedure. We assume that the standard deviation of the mole fractions σ ( x i ) is independent of the concentration for small mole fraction differences Δ x i . The standard deviations of the mole fractions σ ( x i ) are specific for each system. Still, the standard deviations appear to be similar for components i within one system in this study based on the RMSE cal ( x i ) values determined from calibration. Hence, σ ( x i ) are assumed to be the same for all components of one system, constant and independent. Therefore, unweighted least squares are used in the parameter estimation of the diffusion coefficient:

From cou.: 47 The IHM analysis of the binary system cyclohexane + toluene yields a very small root mean square error for the mole fractions RMSEcal(xi) = 0.12 mol% as determined from repeated measurements. Typical Raman spectra for the inlet solutions of the system cyclohexane + toluene are shown in Fig. 4(A), which correspond to mole fractions of xcyclohexane = 58.5 mol% and xcyclohexane = 61.5 mol%. Since the concentration difference between the inlets is reduced during the diffusion process, all spectra obtained in the microchannel lie in-between these spectra. A very low RMSEcal was still achieved as the Raman spectra of cyclohexane and toluene provide several distinctive peaks and the integrated areas of the pure components are of similar size (Fig. 4(B)). All bands in the spectral range from 500 cm−1 to 1800 cm−1 were considered in the IHM analysis.
From Soup: 47 Here, n exp denotes the number of experiments, n c the number of components, n s the number of observation points, and n R ( o ) the number of Raman spectra along the measurement line at observation point s o . x calc denotes the calculated mole fractions from the convection–diffusion model (1)–(4) . To account for uncertainties in the initial experimental conditions, several experimental parameters are fitted together with the diffusion coefficient: Δ s is an offset of the observation point s 1 to the inlet. One Δ s is adjusted for each experiment; it is typically in the range of 0 μm to 2 μm. The distances between the observation points s 1 to s 4 are fixed. y 0 adjusts the position where the two channel inlets join. One y 0 is adjusted for each experiment; it is typically in the range of −5 μm to 5 μm. The mole fractions x l and x r at the left and right inlet, respectively, are fitted once for each experiment.
 ###### 
From cou.: 48 For the ternary system 1-propanol + 1-chlorobutane + heptane, an error of the mole fractions of RMSEcal(xi) = 0.5 mol% was obtained within the mole fraction range of 1-propanol and 1-chlorobutane from 30.8 mol% to 35.8 mol%. The spectra at the channel inlets for series A and series B are shown in Fig. 3(A). The shown spectra are typical for this mole fraction range. The higher uncertainty for the ternary system compared to the binary system results from overlapping characteristic spectral bands of the pure components (Fig. 3(B)) and the resulting more difficult assigning of components in the spectral analysis. The spectral analysis by IHM considered all spectral bands from 500 cm−1 to 1600 cm−1.
From Soup: 48 The diffusion coefficient D V is positive definite according to the thermodynamics of irreversible processes. 38 The corresponding constraints are directly incorporated into the fitting procedure by a reparameterization proposed in our earlier work (eqn (S4) in the ESI † ). 35
 ###### 
From cou.: 49 The mole fractions xi,meas are the input to the parameter estimation procedure for the diffusion coefficient DV. The parameter estimation is based on a maximum likelihood procedure. We assume that the standard deviation of the mole fractions σ(xi) is independent of the concentration for small mole fraction differences Δxi. The standard deviations of the mole fractions σ(xi) are specific for each system. Still, the standard deviations appear to be similar for components i within one system in this study based on the RMSEcal(xi) values determined from calibration. Hence, σ(xi) are assumed to be the same for all components of one system, constant and independent. Therefore, unweighted least squares are used in the parameter estimation of the diffusion coefficient:
From Soup: 49 For multicomponent diffusion, the diffusion coefficient matrix depends on the order of the components in the estimation procedure. 38 Here, the order of components in the parameter estimation is taken from the first publication of the measured system in the literature 22 to obtain the same Fick diffusion coefficients.

To account for uncertainties in the initial experimental conditions, several experimental parameters are fitted together with the diffusion coefficient: Δs is an offset of the observation point s1 to the inlet. One Δs is adjusted for each experiment; it is typically in the range of 0 μm to 2 μm. The distances between the observation points s1 to s4 are fixed. y0 adjusts the position where the two channel inlets join. One y0 is adjusted for each experiment; it is typically in the range of −5 μm to 5 μm. The mole fractions xl and xr at the left and right inlet, respectively, are fitted once for each experiment.

As expected, the mole fraction gradient decreases with consecutive observation points s 1 to s 4 . Measured and calculated mole fractions are in excellent agreement for all experiments. The deviation between measurement and model has a root mean square error (RMSE fit ) of less than 0.1 mol%. Hence, the RMSE fit is smaller than the RMSE cal of the mole fractions of 0.12 mol% from calibrations.

For the diffusion coefficient D V , a relative standard deviation of σ ( D V ) = 2.4% was obtained (the relative error is related to the mean measured diffusion coefficient).

From Soup: 54 An excellent agreement is found with the measurements of Sanni et al. 48 ( Table 2 ): the deviation between the diffusion coefficients is 0.45%.

As expected, the mole fraction gradient decreases with consecutive observation points s1 to s4. Measured and calculated mole fractions are in excellent agreement for all experiments. The deviation between measurement and model has a root mean square error (RMSEfit) of less than 0.1 mol%.

From Soup: 55 For the system 1-propanol + 1-chlorobutane + heptane, the diffusion coefficient matrix D V was estimated according to eqn (7) by two procedures: in the first procedure, diffusion coefficients were determined for every individual experiment ( n exp = 1) from series A and series B, e.g. , experiment A.1. In the second procedure, diffusion coefficients were determined for all combinations of one experiment from series A with one experiment of series B ( n exp = 2), e.g. , A.1 with B.3.

The plot shows excellent agreement between the measured and the calculated mole fractions: the RMSE fit is less than 0.4 mol%. The agreement between model and experiment retained the same excellent quality independently whether the diffusion coefficient was determined from individual experiments or two independent experiments (Table S5 in the ESI † ). Hence, the convection–diffusion model is suitable to describe the mass transport for multicomponent systems.
 ###### 
From cou.: 57 An excellent agreement is found with the measurements of Sanni et al.48 (Table 2): the deviation between the diffusion coefficients is 0.45%. Thus, the diffusion coefficient from the microfluidic experiment agrees with the value from Sanni et al.48 within the measurement uncertainty.
From Soup: 57 As shown in Fig. 6 , the mole fraction gradient of 1-propanol decreases slowest of all three components. The mole fraction gradient of 1-chlorobutane decreases fastest of all three components ( D 22 > D 11 ). For heptane, the gradient decreases moderately.

From Soup: 59 The estimation of a ternary diffusion coefficient from only one single experiment was successful. The ternary diffusion coefficient matrix D V from individual experiments is shown in the left bars in the matrix of Fig. 7 ( n exp = 1). The numerical data are also given in Table S5. † Although we used few data, reasonable precision and accuracy of the diffusion coefficient D V were achieved. The relative error of the diffusion coefficient σ ( D V ) is less than 33%. Here and in the following, relative errors are related to the geometric mean of the eigenvalues . Main and cross diffusion coefficients are correlated as the diffusion behavior cannot be unambiguously assigned to the four diffusion coefficients based on a single experiment. The results agree with our expectations as moderate measurement precisions for measurements of multicomponent diffusion coefficients from single experiments are predicted from theory. 35 Notably, the averaged diffusion coefficient matrix agrees with literature data 22 within the measurement uncertainty. Altogether, one microfluidic experiment is sufficient to measure a ternary diffusion coefficient. Determining the multicomponent diffusion coefficient D V from only one single experiment is only possible with spectroscopic analysis as this analysis provides all concentrations simultaneously. Hence, the experimental effort can be considerably reduced.

From Soup: 63 The high quality of the fit of the single experiments was retained in the fit of 2 combined experiments (RMSE fit = 0.29 mol%, see Table S5 in the ESI † ). The second experiment in the evaluation reduces cross-correlations between entries of the diffusion matrix D i , j . Thereby, high precision is achieved and the second independent experiment is highly beneficial: the standard deviation decreases by a factor of 10 in comparison to the estimation from single experiments. We assume that the main remaining source of uncertainty is the accuracy of the temperature control as in the case of binary diffusion.

From Soup: 64 A very good agreement with the literature data 22 was achieved. The relative deviations are 2.3% and 3.4% for main diffusion coefficients. The main diffusion coefficients agree with the literature values within the measurement uncertainties. Regarding the cross-diffusion coefficients, deviations of less than 8% from literature were observed. Overall, excellent accuracy, precision, and agreement with literature data were achieved.

Even in this case, the quality of the fit stays very high (RMSE fit = 0.29 mol%, Table S5 in the ESI † ).

From Soup: 66 We have developed a measurement method for multicomponent diffusion coefficients in liquids combining microfluidics with Raman microspectroscopy. All experiments were well described by the multicomponent convection–diffusion model and the measured diffusion coefficients agree with the literature values. Therefore, the assumptions underlying our convection–diffusion model are in agreement with our experimental results. Reliable operation has been proven for binary and ternary systems. Here, the ternary system was used as prototype of multicomponent fluids. As the measurement method provides information on mole fractions of all components simultaneously, the measurement method is expected to provide also diffusion coefficients for systems with more components.

From Soup: 67 In particular, it was shown that one multicomponent experiment suffices to determine ternary diffusion coefficients. For the ternary system, a reasonable accuracy of the diffusion coefficients ( σ ( D V ) = 33%) was already achieved from a single experiment. By combining two independent experiments, excellent precision and accuracy were achieved ( σ ( D V ) = 3.1%). Despite the high spatial resolution of the Raman spectra (2.5 μm), the experiment duration (<1 h) is competitive to the fastest classical diffusion experiments. The sample consumption is less than 5 mL. Furthermore, the number of experiments was reduced in comparison to classical methods.

From Soup: 68 The setup could be used for diffusion coefficient measurements in more complex fluids, e.g. , proteins in solution, as investigated by Loureiro et al. 50 The measurement of diffusion coefficients of nanoparticles in suspension, as used by Chrimes et al. 51,52 should also be possible with corresponding adaptions ( e.g. , to account for the very small diffusion coefficients in the order of 1 × 10 −10 m 2 s −1 to 1 × 10 −11 m 2 s −1 ).The current model assumed negligible excess volumes and negligible change in viscosities between the inlets but these limitations could probably be overcome by expanding the convection–diffusion model. The main limitation of the presented setup is that the studied species have to be Raman active and sufficiently different in the Raman spectra. Spectral analysis might further be complicated by fluorescence interference with the Raman signal. Fluorescence can be handled, e.g. , by using a different laser wavelength or pseudosecond derivatives in the analysis. 46,53–55 If Raman spectroscopy is not suitable for a mixture of interest, other spectroscopic techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 56,57 could be used in the setup as long as they allow for in situ confocal measurements.
