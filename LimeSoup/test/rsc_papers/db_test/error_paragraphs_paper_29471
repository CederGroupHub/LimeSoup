From cou.: 1 The crystal structures and magnetic properties of two novel polyclusters {[Cu3(tci)2(H2O)2]·12H2O}n (1) and {[Cu3(tci)2(H2O)2]·6H2O}n (2) (tci = tris(2-carboxyethyl) isocyanurate) are investigated. The X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that they contain interesting infinite alternating chains of dinuclear paddle-wheel copper and mononuclear copper units arranged in ABBA magnetism exchange mode. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements on the two polyclusters show strong antiferromagnetism couplings between copper ions with exchange interactions J = −181.4 cm−1, zj′ = −0.31 cm−1 for 1, J = −170 cm−1, zj′ = −0.42 cm−1 for 2. With the aim of studying magneto-structural correlation, we synthesized a three-dimensional polymer [Cu3(tci)2(py)4(H2O)2]n (3) based on isolated dinuclear cluster and mononuclear copper units. Fitting the susceptibility data yielded J = −176.1 cm−1, zj′ = −0.084 cm−1 for 3.

From cou.: 2 To date, the design and synthesis of magnetic materials with transition metals and organic bridging ligands continues to be a productive area due to their intriguing structures and potential application as molecular-based materials.1,2 A large and diverse group of magnetic materials are made up of copper(II) with carboxylic acids not only because of the paramagnetic copper ions, but also carboxylic acids which can offer super-exchange pathways to transfer interactions between copper ions.3 Covered by many literatures about copper magnets are individual copper(II) clusters such as dinuclear, trinuclear, tetranuclear and so on,4 as well as uniform copper chains.5 To the best of our knowledge, relatively fewer numbers of examples like alternating copper chains arranged in ABBA magnetism exchange mode,6ABAB mode,7 and AABB mode are known.8

From cou.: 3 The frequent coordination modes of carboxylate groups to transfer magnetism can be divided into two types: one is in μ2-η2 mode, which provides more opportunities for generating ferromagnetism between copper ions;9 the other is in μ2-η1:η1 mode which probably produces antiferromagnetism.10 From this point of view, if copper ions are linked together by more than one carboxyl group in the two modes, alternating polycluster copper chains with more complicated structures and magnetic properties are probably generated. An effective approach for constructing the chains is to use proper flexible multifunctional carboxylic acid ligands,11 which hold multiple coordination sites and diverse coordination modes, and act as bridging or chelating ligands to form alternating chains. Herein, we chose a flexible tripodal carboxylic acid, tris(2-carboxyethyl) isocyanurate (tci), and succeeded in growing single crystals of {[Cu3(tci)2(H2O)2]·12H2O}n (1) and {[Cu3(tci)2(H2O)2]·6H2O}n (2) containing alternating chains arranged in ABBA mode by changing pH values and the ratios of the ligand to copper(II). With the motivation of investigating magneto-structural correlation, we synthesized [Cu3(tci)2(py)4(H2O)2]n (3) containing isolated dinuclear clusters and mononuclear copper units.11g Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements show that the three polyclusters display strong antiferromagnetism coupling intensities between the copper(II) ions.

From cou.: 9 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic system with space groupC2/m. The structure is composed of linear alternating chains arranged by paddle-wheel dinuclear clusters and mononuclear copper units, and shows a three-dimensional porous framework. As can be seen in Fig. 1a, the asymmetric unit of 1 consists of two crystallographically independent Cu(II) ions, one tci ligand and two water molecules. The Cu1 atom lies at a site with 2/m symmetry and Cu2 is on a mirror plane; besides, the tci ligand lies about a mirror plane and the water oxygen O5 is on a two-fold axis. Each tci3− connects three dinuclear cluster units and one mononuclear copper unit in different coordination modes (Scheme 1). The mononuclear Cu1 ion which is located in a square-planar environment is coordinated by two oxygen atoms from a carboxylate group in μ2-η2 mode and two oxygen atoms from water molecules. Cu2 in dinuclear cluster units presents a slightly distorted square-pyramidal geometry with four basal oxygen atoms from carboxylate groups in syn-syn-μ2-η1:η1 coordination mode and one apical oxygen atom from a carboxylate group in μ2-η2 mode with a markedly longer Cu–O distance of 2.181 Å (the distance between Cu and planar O atoms ranges from 1.988 to 1.993 Å) as the result of the Jahn–Teller effect. Adjacent Cu1 and Cu2 are bridged by the carboxylate groups in μ2-η2 mode to generate an alternating chain arranged as -Cu2-(syn-syn-μ2-η1:η1-COO)4-Cu2-(μ2-η2-COO)-Cu1-(μ2-η2-COO)-Cu2-(syn-syn-μ2-η1:η1-COO)4-Cu2- sequence, which can be refined as ABBA mode (Fig. 1b). The intrachain Cu⋯Cu distances are 2.6259 Å (Cu2A⋯Cu2B), and 3.4359 Å (Cu1⋯Cu2A). The minimum interchain Cu⋯Cu distance is 12.8288 Å. The displacement of Cu2 from the basal plane in the square-pyramid is 0.1934 Å (defined as δ).4a The Cu1–O3–Cu2A bond angle is 120°. Such an interesting alternating chain is structurally analogous to MnII chains which has been previously observed.6 So far as we know, most literature reports about Cu chains are uniform chains, while there are no reports on the alternating Cu chains arranged in ABBA mode, which is considered to be the most remarkable feature. Another interesting structural feature is that adjacent alternating chains are associated together by tci ligands to form a layer (Fig. 1b), and then the layers are further connected by tci3− ligands acting as pillars to build a three-dimensional porous framework with the solvent filling in the pore which is schematically represented by Fig. 1c. The network can be best described as a (6·82)(42·64·86·103)(4·62) topology, if we define the mononuclear copper units as two-coordinated nodes, the copper cluster units as six-coordinated nodes and the tci ligands as three-coordinated nodes (Fig. 1d).

From cou.: 10 The X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic system with space groupC2/m. 2 shows a three-dimensional framework, which is also made up of alternating copper chains by the arrangement of dinuclear paddle-wheel cluster and mononuclear copper units. As shown in Fig. 2a, there are two crystallographically independent Cu(II) ions, one tci ligand and two water molecules in the asymmetric unit. Cu1 is on a mirror plane and the Cu2 atom lies at a site with 2/m symmetry; in addition, the tci ligand lies about a mirror plane and the water oxygen O10 is on a two-fold axis. The mononuclear Cu1 stands in the center of a square planar arrangement with two oxygen atoms from carboxylate groups in syn-anti-μ2-η1:η1 mode and two oxygen atoms from water molecules. Each Cu2 atom showing distorted square-pyramidal geometry is ligated by four basal oxygen atoms from four individual bidentate carboxylate groups in syn-syn-μ2-η1:η1 mode and one apical oxygen atom from one carboxylate group in syn-anti-μ2-η1:η1 mode. The δ is 0.2100 with Cu2–Cu2A being 2.6280 Å. Adjacent mononuclear copper and dinuclear cluster units are bridged by one carboxylate group in syn-anti-μ2-η1:η1 coordination mode with a Cu1⋯Cu2 distance of 5.045 Å, which is larger than that in 1. This leads to the formation of a 1D alternating chain along the c axis (Fig. 2b). Although the chain can be also regarded as ABBA mode, the chain is arranged as a significant -Cu2-(syn-syn-μ2-η1:η1-COO)4-Cu2-(syn-anti-μ2-η1:η1-COO)-Cu1-(syn-anti-μ2-η1:η1-COO)-Cu2-(syn-syn-μ2-η1:η1-COO)4-Cu2- sequence different from that in 1, Adjacent chains are interlinked by the mutual parallel tci ligands to form layers which are further connected by ligands to generate a three-dimensional framework (Fig. 2c) with the shortest interchain CuII⋯CuII distance of 11.7 Å. If mononuclear copper units are simplified as two-coordinated nodes, dinuclear copper units as six-coordinated nodes and tci ligands as three-coordinated nodes, we can get the topological structure feature of 2 with the Schläfli symbol of (6·82)(42·64·86·103)(4·62) (Fig. 2d).

From cou.: 11 The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of 1 measured in the range of 2–300 K in an external magnetic field of 2000 Oe is shown in Fig. 3a in the form of χM–T and χMT–T (χM being the molar magnetic susceptibility and T the temperature). The shape of this curve clearly shows typical antiferromagnetic interactions among the copper(II) atoms. When lowering the temperature, the χMT values decreases smoothly. At room temperature, the χMT is 0.96 cm3 K mol−1 which is lower than that of three magnetically isolated copper(II) ions (theoretical value for g = 2, S = 1/2, χMT = 3×(Ng2μB2/3k)S(S + 1) = 1.125 cm3 K mol−1), indicating strong antiferromagnetic interactions in 1.

From Soup: 49 A variable-temperature magnetic study on 2 was carried out in the temperature range of 2–300 K, and the magnetic behavior of 2 is shown in Fig. 3b in the form of χ M – T and χ M T – T . The value of χ M T at room temperature is 1.096 cm 3 K mol −1 , which is lower than the 1.125 cm 3 K mol −1 expected for the three magnetically isolated Cu( II ) ions showing strong antiferromagnetic interactions. Upon lowering the temperature, the χ M T value decreases linearly. Considering that the distance between Cu2 and Cu2 in the paddle-wheel dinuclear units is 2.6280 Å, and the nearest distance between Cu1 and Cu2 is 5.0453 Å (the coupling exchange can be neglected), we can use the classical spin model, the spin Hamiltonian which is H = −2 JS 1 S 2 . The susceptibility equation for such system can be written as follows,

From Soup: 61 In order to study the magneto-structural correlation, 3 11g which is a three-dimensional framework based on isolated dinuclear cluster and mononuclear copper units is introduced in our work. Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility data have been measured from 280 K down to 2 K in an external magnetic field of 2000 Oe ( Fig. 3c ). The magnetic behavior of 3 in the form of the χ M - T and χ M T – T is typical antiferromagnetic interaction between the copper( II ) atoms. The value of χ M T at 280 K is 0.86 cm 3 K mol −1 , which is much lower than the three magnetically isolated Cu( II ) ions. On lowering the temperature, the χ M T values for 3 continuously decrease, clearly indicating the presence of antiferromagnetic interaction. To estimate the magnitude of the antiferromagnetic coupling, the magnetic data were fitted to a susceptibility equation derived from a spin Hamiltonian: H = −2 JS 1 S 2 . The susceptibility equation can be written as follows:

From Soup: 69 It is well known that antiferromagnetic coupling intensities are influenced by the decrease of the distance between copper ions and the increasing number of bridging carboxylate groups. 3,15 In the three polymers , the distances between copper ions in dinuclear copper cluster units are around 2.628 Å, which is close to the shortest Cu⋯Cu in the literature, 16 and the number of carboxylate groups is four. So, strongly antiferromagnetic interactions are observed between Cu( II ) ions in these polymers . Furthermore, the syn-syn -μ 2 -η 1 : η 1 bridging conformation of the carboxylate groups which facilitates the coplanarity of the CuOCOCu and OCO planes yields a strong overlap between the d x 2 − y 2 magnetic orbital of Cu ions in dinuclear clusters to mediate large antiferromagnetic interactions. 17 In addition, the 2p x orbital of the O atoms affords strong super-exchange interaction via the carboxylate's bridge. It is thus not surprising that the fitting results are J = −181.4 cm −1 for 1 , J = −170 cm −1 for 2 , and J = −176.1 cm −1 for 3 , which indicate that there are strong antiferromagnetic interactions between the copper ions in dinuclear clusters of the three polymers . Previous studies have shown that the δ value (defined as the displacement of metal atoms from the basal plane in the square-pyramid arrangement) represents the magnetic coupling magnitudes: a smaller δ implies a stronger magnetic coupling. 4a Here, the values of δ (0.1934 Å for 1 , 0.2100 Å for 2 , and 0.2017 Å for 3 ) just agree with the fitting results.

From Soup: 70 In summary, by using the flexible tripodal tris(2-carboxyethyl) isocyanurate ligand , we have synthesized two novel three-dimensional porous frameworks which present rare alternating chains arranged in magnetism exchange interaction ABBA mode. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements show that the three polyclusters display strong antiferromagnetic properties.
