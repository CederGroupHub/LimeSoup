From cou.: 1 Adhesion is important in many industrial applications including those in the microelectronics industry. Flip-chip assemblies commonly utilize epoxy underfills to promote reliability and the buried interfacial structure of underfills is crucial to device lifetime. Poor adhesion at this interface can cause premature device failure. One method to increase adhesion strength is to plasma treat the substrate attached to underfills, however, the mechanism of this increase in adhesion strength has not been thoroughly investigated at the molecular level in situ, because it is difficult to probe a buried interface where the adhesion occurs. In this work, sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy was utilized to investigate the buried polymer/epoxy resin interface at the molecular level. Plasma treatment was performed on the polymer surfaces and the effects were examined. The buried interfaces between the polymer surface before and after plasma treatment and epoxy were then investigated to understand if the effects of the treatment can be observed using SFG. It was found that the molecular structure of the buried interface of the pristine polymer surface in contact with epoxy is drastically different from the buried interface of the plasma treated surface with epoxy. The buried interface containing the plasma treated polymer surface was found to be considerably more disordered and had much higher adhesion strength. This research elucidates the plasma treatment effects on structures and properties of buried polymer/epoxy interfaces, providing in-depth understanding on the mechanism of adhesion strength increase facilitated by plasma treatment.

From cou.: 2 The microelectronics industry has been evolving rapidly in the past few decades, primarily due to the invention of the integrated circuit (IC), but other improvements in technology have also pushed it forward. One innovation that has revolutionized the field is the flip-chip device, which utilizes solder bumps instead of wires.1 To strengthen the interface and improve reliability, underfill material was introduced, in which the resin is extruded and adheres to both the substrate and die.2 Underfill material greatly increases flip chip joint reliability and improves fatigue endurance, but delamination of underfill/polymer interfaces is still of great concern.3,4 The underfill material greatly improves the lifetime of flip-chip devices and it is still under much research to improve the performance. Currently bisphenol-type epoxy adhesives are the most widely used underfill material in the microelectronics industry due to their fast curing times and strength.5

From cou.: 3 The die and substrate interface with underfill is of paramount importance for package life, as delamination in this region can lead to moisture diffusion or cracking of the interconnection, which will lead to device failure.6 Because of the importance of underfill adhesion for the reliability of the flip-chip assembly, it has been studied extensively. However, most of the studies on such adhesion focused on the macroscale or on a mechanical level. There have not been extensive studies on the molecular structures of buried interfaces in situ involving epoxy or underfill materials.

From cou.: 5 The mechanism of adhesion greatly depends on the molecular interfacial structure, which are directly correlated to the strength of adhesion.14–17 However, studying polymer/epoxy or underfill interfaces on the molecular level is exceptionally challenging. Typically, the interface is separated and the resulting surfaces are inspected by surface sensitive techniques such as XPS,18 SEM,19etc. But when the interface is separated, the interfacial interactions may be altered. Therefore it is difficult to obtain information about molecular interactions at the buried interface using the above methods. An analytical method that can operate in situ is necessary to understand molecular interactions at the buried intact interface.

From cou.: 6 Over the past few years, SFG vibrational spectroscopy has been used extensively as a noninvasive analytical tool to study buried interfaces and surfaces, generating molecular-level detail in situ.20–23 SFG is an optical process thus, any interface that is accessible to laser light can be studied with it. Therefore, SFG can study buried interfaces in situ, without destroying the interface, as is necessary with standard surface sensitive techniques (e.g. XPS). This is why SFG is the best choice in this study because adhesion is related to the buried interfacial structure. SFG spectroscopy can be utilized to investigate surface and interfacial chemical structure, such as coverage, orientation, and orientation distribution of interfacial functional groups. It can probe interfacial molecular interactions, such as interfacial diffusion and interfacial hydrogen bonding networks.24,25 This technique has also been extensively utilized to study polymer systems and buried polymer interfaces.26–33 Research in our group also focuses on SFG spectroscopic studies on model and commercial epoxy systems typically used as underfill material in the microelectronics industry.34–43 We have shown how SFG can investigate the structure–function relationship of complex systems noninvasively.34–36,38,44–50

From cou.: 7 In this study, SFG and ATR-FTIR spectroscopies were implemented to probe buried interfaces between a commercial epoxy, which is primarily composed of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE), and two polymer materials, polystyrene (PS) and poly(pyromellitic dianhydride-co-4,4′-oxydianiline) (PMDA/ODA or PI). Pristine and He plasma treated polymer surfaces were investigated as well as buried polymer (before and after plasma treatment)/epoxy interfaces. In addition to spectroscopic analysis, adhesion testing experiments were performed to measure the adhesion strengths between epoxies and polymers to understand if the plasma treatment increased the adhesion strength. The adhesion measurement data can be interpreted by the molecular structures of the buried interfaces deduced from the SFG results. Contact angle measurements were also performed to see if the polymer surfaces become more hydrophilic after plasma treatment.

ACS reagent grade toluene (>99.5%) and ACS reagent grade ethanol (>99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Contrex powdered labware detergent was bought from Decon Labs (King of Prussia, PA). N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and Poly(pyromellitic dianhydride-co-4,40-oxydianiline) amic acid solution (polyamic acid) as a ∼13 wt% solution in solvent were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The deuterated polystyrene (d8-PS or dPS) was purchased from Polymer Science, Inc., (Monticello, IN) and a solution (2.0 weight%) was made by dissolving it in toluene. Commercial epoxy resin 3302 (CE3302) was obtained from Epoxies Etc. (Cranston, RI). CE3302 base is a proprietary blend, composed predominantly of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether and trace amounts of bis(1,2,2,6,6-pentamethyl-4 piperidinyl)-sebacate and 4-nonylphenol. The CE3302 hardener used was poly(oxypropylenediamine). Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) is produced in the curing process and then reacts further with poly(oxypropylenediamine) to produce a cross-linked structure.36 All pertinent chemical structures can be found in Fig. 1. Compressed He (>99.99%) was obtained from Metro Welding (Detroit, MI). High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS) Standard Tolerance, ASTM D1892 and PEI (Polyetherimide), Standard Tolerance, ASTM D5205 were both purchased (Amazon, Seattle, WA) and utilized for lap shear analysis. Because PS is very brittle, we used HIPS in the adhesion tests. The water contact angle on HIPS (114°) is similar to that measured on the pure PS film surface. We believe that HIPS can serve as a model for PS in the adhesion testing experiment. Optical fiber polishing paper was purchased from Thorlabs (Newtown, NJ) (30 μm, 6 μm, 3 μm, 1 μm, and 0.02 μm grit).

From cou.: 9 Silica or CaF2 prisms were used for SFG experiments. Silica prisms were cleaned first in a concentrated sulfuric acid bath saturated with potassium dichromate followed by a rinse of deionized water and then they were finally dried under a stream of nitrogen. Following the acid cleaning, the substrates were exposed to air plasma (Plasma Etch, Inc., PE-50, Carson City, NV) for 2 minutes prior to polymer film deposition. CaF2 prisms were cleaned by soaking in toluene for 72 hours, rinsing with ethanol, washing with detergent, rinsing with DI water, and then finally exposed to air plasma for 2 minutes. A polymer solution (2% by mass dPS in toluene) was spin-cast on the fused silica or CaF2 substrates at 2500 rpm for 30 s using a P-6000 spin coater (Speedline Technologies, Franklin, MA). In order to remove solvent residue, the samples were heated at 50 °C for 2 hours. For ATR-FTIR measurements, CaF2 prisms were utilized and cleaned as specified above. For the PMDA–ODA film, a poly(pyromellitic dianhydride-co-4,40-oxydianiline) solution was diluted 1:3 by weight in NMP. Polyimide thin films were deposited by spin casting the diluted poly(pyromellitic dianhydride-co-4,40-oxydianiline) solution on prisms at 3000 RPM for 30 s. Cross-linked polyimide films were prepared by curing the poly(pyromellitic dianhydride-co-4,40-oxydianiline) film in a vacuum furnace (STT-1200C-6-12 High Temperature Tube Furnace, Sentro Tech Corp., Strongsville, OH) at 260 °C for 60 minutes, which then produces the cross-linked poly(pyromellitic dianhydride-co-4,4′-oxydianiline) (PMDA/ODA), henceforth referred to as PI. The prepared PS and PI polymer surfaces were then exposed to He plasma for 100 s and then put in contact with the epoxy. For epoxy curing, the mixing ratio for resin to hardener was 2:1 by mass. After vigorously mixing the resin and hardener together, the epoxy was cured on top of the spin-cast polymer films according to manufacturer specifications (2 hours at 52 °C).36

From cou.: 10 Lap shear samples were prepared by sanding a portion of the surface (25 mm × 10 mm) of the adherent (30 mm × 50 mm × 10 mm) with optical fiber polishing paper, going from 30 μm, 6 μm, 3 μm, 1 μm, and finally to 0.02 μm, which should yield a surface that has a roughness on the order of tens of nanometers. Following sanding some of the lap shear adherents were plasma treated for 100 s in helium. Following plasma treatment an edge of the polymer adherent was coated with a ∼3 mm × ∼25 mm rectangle of epoxy prepared as described above. Another polymer adherent was placed on top of the epoxied adherent. The samples were then placed in an oven and cured as described above. All adhesion failures were determined to be adhesive failure at the epoxy/polymer interface, which was determined by a visual comparison of the delaminated area and a control region, which was not exposed to the adhesive.

The fundamental output from the Nd:YAG laser was a 1064 nm beam with a 50 Hz repetition rate and a 30 ps pulse duration. The fixed frequency 532 nm visible input beam and frequency tunable infrared beam (2.3–10.0 μm) were produced from this 1064 nm beam and were over-lapped at the surface of polymer films on solid supports with input angles of 60° and 54° versus the surface normal, respectively. The beam energies for the visible and infrared lasers were 150 and 30 μJ, respectively. Both beam diameters were approximately 500 μm at the polymer film surface. The reflected SFG beam was directed through a monochromator after which the beam intensity was measured using a gated photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu Corp., Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka, Japan). All SFG spectra were collected in the ssp (s-polarized SFG signal, s-polarized input visible, and p-polarized input infrared) and sps polarization combinations by scanning the infrared beam frequency while the monochromator was tuned automatically. For all SFG data collected, prism geometry was utilized, see Fig. 1. We repeated every experiment at least three times and for each time, at least three samples were prepared. The results are very reproducible and each spectrum presented in this work is the average of many SFG spectra with 100 averages per spectral point.

From Soup: 41 The first system that will be discussed is the dPS/epoxy buried interface involving dPS before and after 100 s He plasma. It is well known that plasma treatment can influence the PS surface structure. 60,69 Prior to the plasma treatment the dPS surface gives very strong SFG signal ( Fig. 2 ), showing the surface is well ordered. There are two peaks in the SFG spectrum, at 2275 cm −1 and 2295 cm −1 , which can be assigned to the v 20b and the v 2 vibrational modes, respectively. 64 After the He plasma treatment, the SFG intensity from the dPS surface greatly decreases to nearly zero. SFG signal is proportional to coverage, orientation, and orientation distribution, thus any of these three factors could be changing, which will decrease the SFG intensity. Our previous study indicated that plasma treatment changed the orientation of the surface phenyl group on PS surface, which led to SFG signal intensity decrease. 70 Here no SFG signal detected may be due to the total loss of the surface phenyl groups, or the phenyl completely lying down geometry, or a broader distribution of orientation angles. We refer the latter two cases to “disordered” structure of dPS at the interface. We believe that in this case the dPS surface was more disordered after the plasma treatment, along with some surface phenyl group loss.
 ###### 
From cou.: 42 yzy
From Soup: 42 For this system, we also applied ATR-FTIR spectroscopy to study the entire dPS film before and after He plasma treatment to see whether plasma treatment can remove the PS film or cause substantial bulk structural change ( Fig. 2 ). The theoretical penetration depth of the evanescent wave has been calculated previously as 800 nm, the dPS thin film is approximately 100 nm before plasma treatment, 33 therefore ATR-FTIR spectra can probe the entire dPS film. Fig. 2 shows the ATR-FTIR spectra collected from the dPS polymer film before and after 100 s He plasma, from which four peaks at 2193 cm −1 , 2236 cm −1 , 2272 cm −1 , 2285 cm −1 could be observed, assigned to the methylene sym , methylene asym , and two phenyl ring stretching modes, respectively. 71 The very similar ATR-FTIR spectra observed from dPS before and after He plasma treatment, shown by the subtraction results in Fig. 2 , indicate that the plasma treatment did not remove the dPS film and did not cause substantial bulk structural change. Therefore the plasma treatment could alter the dPS surface structure, but not the bulk structure.
 ###### 
From cou.: 43 asym
From Soup: 43 We then probed the buried polymer/epoxy systems in the dPS C–D stretching and the epoxy C–H stretching regions of the spectrum. The C–D stretching signals should be contributed from dPS because epoxy does not contain any C–D bonds. Prior to plasma treatment on dPS, there is a strong peak at 2290 cm −1 detected from the dPS/epoxy interface, attributed to the v 2 symmetric vibrational mode ( Fig. 3 ). After 100 s He plasma treatment on dPS, this peak was no longer detected from the dPS (with plasma treatment)/epoxy interface ( Fig. 3 ). This shows that the dPS/epoxy interface is well ordered prior to plasma treatment on the dPS surface. After plasma treating the dPS surface, dPS at the dPS/epoxy interface should change orientation and must be much less ordered (either lying down or having a broader orientation distribution or both) and the interface yields no SFG signal.
 ###### 
From cou.: 44 67
From Soup: 44 Fig. 3 also shows the sps and ssp SFG spectra collected from the dPS (before and after 100 s He plasma)/epoxy buried interfaces in the C–H stretching frequency region. Such C–H signals should be contributed from epoxy. As discussed above, plasma can alter the PS surface structure. Here Fig. 3 shows clearly that the SFG spectra collected from the dPS/epoxy buried interfaces before and after plasma treatment are very different in the C–H stretching frequency region, indicating that the He plasma treatment of dPS surface influenced the behavior of epoxy at the buried dPS/epoxy interface.
 ###### 
From cou.: 45 The first system that will be discussed is the dPS/epoxy buried interface involving dPS before and after 100 s He plasma. It is well known that plasma treatment can influence the PS surface structure.60,69 Prior to the plasma treatment the dPS surface gives very strong SFG signal (Fig. 2), showing the surface is well ordered. There are two peaks in the SFG spectrum, at 2275 cm−1 and 2295 cm−1, which can be assigned to the v20b and the v2 vibrational modes, respectively.64 After the He plasma treatment, the SFG intensity from the dPS surface greatly decreases to nearly zero. SFG signal is proportional to coverage, orientation, and orientation distribution, thus any of these three factors could be changing, which will decrease the SFG intensity.

We refer the latter two cases to “disordered” structure of dPS at the interface. We believe that in this case the dPS surface was more disordered after the plasma treatment, along with some surface phenyl group loss.
From Soup: 45 The interface between epoxy and a pristine dPS sample yielded very strong SFG signals in both ssp and sps polarization combinations, while the interface between epoxy and the polymer surface exposed to 100 s He plasma generated much lower SFG intensity. This is similar to what was observed for dPS before and after the He plasma treatment at the dPS/epoxy interface. In the sps spectrum from the dPS (before or after plasma treatment)/epoxy interface in the C–H stretching frequency region, there is one peak present at 2960 cm −1 that can be assigned to the methyl antisymmetric stretch. 34 The ssp spectra can be fitted using five peaks, 2855 cm −1 (CH 2 sym ), 2870 cm −1 (CH 3 sym ), 2915 cm −1 (CH 2 asym ), 2943 cm −1 (Fermi Resonance), and at 2970 cm −1 (CH 3 asym ). In order to perform orientation calculations, all the sps and ssp spectra were fitted. The fitted spectra are plotted in the ESI, † (Fig. S1) along with the fitting parameters (Table S1, ESI † ).
 ###### 
From cou.: 46 For this system, we also applied ATR-FTIR spectroscopy to study the entire dPS film before and after He plasma treatment to see whether plasma treatment can remove the PS film or cause substantial bulk structural change (Fig. 2). The theoretical penetration depth of the evanescent wave has been calculated previously as 800 nm, the dPS thin film is approximately 100 nm before plasma treatment,33 therefore ATR-FTIR spectra can probe the entire dPS film. Fig. 2 shows the ATR-FTIR spectra collected from the dPS polymer film before and after 100 s He plasma, from which four peaks at 2193 cm−1, 2236 cm−1, 2272 cm−1, 2285 cm−1 could be observed, assigned to the methylene sym, methylene asym, and two phenyl ring stretching modes, respectively.71 The very similar ATR-FTIR spectra observed from dPS before and after He plasma treatment, shown by the subtraction results in Fig. 2, indicate that the plasma treatment did not remove the dPS film and did not cause substantial bulk structural change. Therefore the plasma treatment could alter the dPS surface structure, but not the bulk structure.
From Soup: 46 Since SFG signal could be detected from C–H stretching modes of epoxy at the buried dPS/epoxy interface, we know that the epoxy molecules at the interface are ordered. SFG spectroscopy is sensitive to the interface coverage, orientation, orientation distribution (or ordering), therefore the structural change of the dPS surface caused by plasma treatment altered the interfacial epoxy coverage, orientation, or ordering. Plasma treatment is known to increase the strength of adhesion between polymers and underfill materials. 72–74 Such adhesion promotion must be induced by the structural change at the interface.
 ###### 
From cou.: 47 We then probed the buried polymer/epoxy systems in the dPS C–D stretching and the epoxy C–H stretching regions of the spectrum. The C–D stretching signals should be contributed from dPS because epoxy does not contain any C–D bonds. Prior to plasma treatment on dPS, there is a strong peak at 2290 cm−1 detected from the dPS/epoxy interface, attributed to the v2 symmetric vibrational mode (Fig. 3). After 100 s He plasma treatment on dPS, this peak was no longer detected from the dPS (with plasma treatment)/epoxy interface (Fig. 3). This shows that the dPS/epoxy interface is well ordered prior to plasma treatment on the dPS surface. After plasma treating the dPS surface, dPS at the dPS/epoxy interface should change orientation and must be much less ordered (either lying down or having a broader orientation distribution or both) and the interface yields no SFG signal.
From Soup: 47 To further understand the structural difference of the interfaces between pristine and plasma treated dPS and epoxy, we studied orientations of methyl groups of the epoxy at the interface based on the relationships between the SFG measured data and the (CH 3 ) 2 C group orientation ( Fig. 4 ). Here the experimentally measured χ yyz , sym / χ yzy , asym and χ yyz , asym / χ yzy , asym values were used to determine the methyl orientation angle ( Fig. 4 ). 67 The deduced orientation angles are listed in Table 1 . It is feasible to deduce both the average orientation and orientation distribution (assuming a Gaussian distribution) of a surface functional group using SFG if the surface/interfacial coverage of the functional group is known. 54 Unfortunately here we do not know the interfacial coverage of the isopropyl group. Therefore, we utilize a delta orientation distribution and three Gaussian orientation distributions (with a width of 3°, 5°, and 10°) to deduce the average orientation of isopropyl groups at the dPS/epoxy interface. For measured χ yyz , sym / χ yzy , asym value, the delta distribution shows that the (CH 3 ) 2 C groups at the pristine dPS/epoxy interface have a tilt angle from the surface normal of 21.2 ± 0.8°, and at the plasma treated PS/epoxy interface this angle is 50.6 ± 2.3°. For the σ = 3° Gaussian distribution, 22.1 ± 0.8° and 52.8 ± 2.4° were found for the pristine dPS/epoxy and plasma treated dPS/epoxy interface, respectively. For the σ = 5° Gaussian distribution, 21.2 ± 0.8 and 53.2 ± 2.4° were deduced for the two interfaces. For the σ = 10° Gaussian distribution, 16.6 ± 0.6 and 54.9 ± 2.5° were determined. For measured χ yyz , asym / χ yzy , asym value, the delta distribution shows that the (CH 3 ) 2 C groups at the pristine dPS/epoxy interface have a tilt angle from the surface normal of 21.0 ± 0.8° and at the plasma treated dPS/epoxy interface, 46.8 ± 8.4°. For the σ = 3° Gaussian distribution, 20.5 ± 0.8° and 46.8 ± 8.4° were found for the pristine dPS/epoxy and plasma treated dPS/epoxy interface, respectively. For the σ = 5° Gaussian distribution, 19.5 ± 0.8 and 46.9 ± 8.4° were deduced for the two interfaces, respectively. For the σ = 10° Gaussian distribution, 13.9 ± 0.5 and 47.1 ± 8.5° were determined. Since the results from the two independent measurements χ yyz , sym / χ yzy , asym and χ yyz , asym / χ yzy , asym led to similar results, we believe that the assumption of a narrow angle distribution is reasonable. For convenience, here the σ = 10° case will be used, and the average tilt angles measured from the χ yyz , sym / χ yzy , asym and χ yyz , asym / χ yzy , asym ratios will be discussed below. Here the (CH 3 ) 2 C tilt angle at the dPS (prior to He plasma treatment)/epoxy interface is 15.3 ± 0.8, after plasma treating the dPS surface, this tilt angle at the dPS (after plasma treatment)/epoxy interface is larger, 51.0 ± 9.5°. This shows that the (CH 3 ) 2 C group tilts more at the dPS/epoxy interface after the dPS surface was plasma treated ( Fig. 4 ). It is interesting to note that prior to the plasma treatment that both methyl groups in (CH 3 ) 2 C are sticking mostly straight up at the interface, and then after plasma treatment one of the methyl groups is sticking more up and the other one is lying more down at the interface, the entire isopropyl group rotates by 40° after plasma treatment.
 ###### 
From cou.: 48 Fig. 3 also shows the sps and ssp SFG spectra collected from the dPS (before and after 100 s He plasma)/epoxy buried interfaces in the C–H stretching frequency region. Such C–H signals should be contributed from epoxy. As discussed above, plasma can alter the PS surface structure. Here Fig. 3 shows clearly that the SFG spectra collected from the dPS/epoxy buried interfaces before and after plasma treatment are very different in the C–H stretching frequency region, indicating that the He plasma treatment of dPS surface influenced the behavior of epoxy at the buried dPS/epoxy interface.
From Soup: 48 Such orientation changes may decrease the SFG signal intensity. As we presented above, SFG signals detected from epoxy at the dPS (after plasma treatment)/epoxy interface indeed do decrease. The decrease of the SFG signal could also be due to a broader orientation distribution ( i.e. a broader distribution of tilt angles) or a lower number density of methyl groups at the interface in addition to the average orientation angle effect. A more broad distribution of tilt angles means a more randomly orientated or more disordered interface. The lack of order could come from interfacial diffusion, where there is no longer a well-defined boundary at the interface, which has been observed previously. 33,36 The interfacial diffusion will increase the adhesion strength. Unfortunately, here we could not determine the orientation and orientation distribution at the same time. Therefore we could not discuss this effect quantitatively.
 ###### 
From cou.: 49 The interface between epoxy and a pristine dPS sample yielded very strong SFG signals in both ssp and sps polarization combinations, while the interface between epoxy and the polymer surface exposed to 100 s He plasma generated much lower SFG intensity. This is similar to what was observed for dPS before and after the He plasma treatment at the dPS/epoxy interface. In the sps spectrum from the dPS (before or after plasma treatment)/epoxy interface in the C–H stretching frequency region, there is one peak present at 2960 cm−1 that can be assigned to the methyl antisymmetric stretch.34 The ssp spectra can be fitted using five peaks, 2855 cm−1 (CH2sym), 2870 cm−1 (CH3sym), 2915 cm−1 (CH2asym), 2943 cm−1 (Fermi Resonance), and at 2970 cm−1 (CH3asym). In order to perform orientation calculations, all the sps and ssp spectra were fitted. The fitted spectra are plotted in the ESI,† (Fig. S1) along with the fitting parameters (Table S1, ESI†).
From Soup: 49 The SFG signal intensity decrease can also be caused by the reduction in number density of the methyl groups at the interface. Using the known hyperpolarizability components and the deduced orientation (by assuming a certain distribution), by taking the ratio of χ After (2) / χ Before (2) , the ratio of N After / N Before can be determined (Here “After” and “Before” mean after and before plasma treatment). Here two vibrational modes were used, the χ yyz , sym and χ yzy , Asym , to deduce this ratio, yielding 0.72 and 0.71 respectively. The two independent measurements lead to a similar result, showing that there is about a 30% decrease in the methyl group coverage at the interface (if assuming the same orientation distribution). This data suggests that the methyl interfacial coverage at the dPS/epoxy interface is indeed reduced at the dPS/epoxy interface after the dPS surface is plasma treated. From the above discussion, it is clear that the SFG signal intensity decrease at the dPS (after plasma treatment)/epoxy interface is due to the (CH 3 ) 2 C orientation change, a broader distribution, a smaller interfacial coverage, or a combination. As we reported previously, both interfacial disordering and less methyl coverage at the interface led to higher adhesion. 36 We therefore believe that the plasma treatment increases the adhesion strength by creating a more disordered interface with fewer methyl groups at the polymer/epoxy interface. (See below.)
 ###### 
From cou.: 50 Since SFG signal could be detected from C–H stretching modes of epoxy at the buried dPS/epoxy interface, we know that the epoxy molecules at the interface are ordered. SFG spectroscopy is sensitive to the interface coverage, orientation, orientation distribution (or ordering), therefore the structural change of the dPS surface caused by plasma treatment altered the interfacial epoxy coverage, orientation, or ordering. Plasma treatment is known to increase the strength of adhesion between polymers and underfill materials.72–74 Such adhesion promotion must be induced by the structural change at the interface.
From Soup: 50 We also used ATR-FTIR to probe the epoxy bulk near the epoxy/dPS interface. As we discussed above, the ATR-FTIR probes ∼800 nm into the sample, therefore it can probe 700 nm into the epoxy region. 33 The ATR-FTIR spectra collected from the sample of dPS polymer (before and after 100 s He plasma) in contact with epoxy can be found in Fig. 5 . In addition to the four peaks from the dPS film, there are three peaks present in the C–H stretching frequency region at 2870 cm −1 , 2930 cm −1 , and 2965 cm −1 , which can be assigned to the epoxy methyl symmetric stretch, methylene antisymmetric stretch, and methyl antisymmetric stretch, respectively. 75 Before and after plasma treatment of dPS, the same signal was observed from the interfaces, showing that we could not observe any differences from the interfacial region (∼800 nm) between dPS (before and after He plasma treatment) and epoxy. This demonstrated that if there is any adhesion difference, it must be due to the interface effect, caused by the plasma treatment on the dPS surface.
 ###### 
From cou.: 51 To further understand the structural difference of the interfaces between pristine and plasma treated dPS and epoxy, we studied orientations of methyl groups of the epoxy at the interface based on the relationships between the SFG measured data and the (CH3)2C group orientation (Fig. 4). Here the experimentally measured χyyz,sym/χyzy,asym and χyyz,asym/χyzy,asym values were used to determine the methyl orientation angle (Fig. 4).67 The deduced orientation angles are listed in Table 1. It is feasible to deduce both the average orientation and orientation distribution (assuming a Gaussian distribution) of a surface functional group using SFG if the surface/interfacial coverage of the functional group is known.54 Unfortunately here we do not know the interfacial coverage of the isopropyl group. Therefore, we utilize a delta orientation distribution and three Gaussian orientation distributions (with a width of 3°, 5°, and 10°) to deduce the average orientation of isopropyl groups at the dPS/epoxy interface. For measured χyyz,sym/χyzy,asym value, the delta distribution shows that the (CH3)2C groups at the pristine dPS/epoxy interface have a tilt angle from the surface normal of 21.2 ± 0.8°, and at the plasma treated PS/epoxy interface this angle is 50.6 ± 2.3°. For the σ = 3° Gaussian distribution, 22.1 ± 0.8° and 52.8 ± 2.4° were found for the pristine dPS/epoxy and plasma treated dPS/epoxy interface, respectively. For the σ = 5° Gaussian distribution, 21.2 ± 0.8 and 53.2 ± 2.4° were deduced for the two interfaces. For the σ = 10° Gaussian distribution, 16.6 ± 0.6 and 54.9 ± 2.5° were determined. For measured χyyz,asym/χyzy,asym value, the delta distribution shows that the (CH3)2C groups at the pristine dPS/epoxy interface have a tilt angle from the surface normal of 21.0 ± 0.8° and at the plasma treated dPS/epoxy interface, 46.8 ± 8.4°. For the σ = 3° Gaussian distribution, 20.5 ± 0.8° and 46.8 ± 8.4° were found for the pristine dPS/epoxy and plasma treated dPS/epoxy interface, respectively. For the σ = 5° Gaussian distribution, 19.5 ± 0.8 and 46.9 ± 8.4° were deduced for the two interfaces, respectively. For the σ = 10° Gaussian distribution, 13.9 ± 0.5 and 47.1 ± 8.5° were determined. Since the results from the two independent measurements χyyz,sym/χyzy,asym and χyyz,asym/χyzy,asym led to similar results, we believe that the assumption of a narrow angle distribution is reasonable. For convenience, here the σ = 10° case will be used, and the average tilt angles measured from the χyyz,sym/χyzy,asym and χyyz,asym/χyzy,asym ratios will be discussed below. Here the (CH3)2C tilt angle at the dPS (prior to He plasma treatment)/epoxy interface is 15.3 ± 0.8, after plasma treating the dPS surface, this tilt angle at the dPS (after plasma treatment)/epoxy interface is larger, 51.0 ± 9.5°. This shows that the (CH3)2C group tilts more at the dPS/epoxy interface after the dPS surface was plasma treated (Fig. 4). It is interesting to note that prior to the plasma treatment that both methyl groups in (CH3)2C are sticking mostly straight up at the interface, and then after plasma treatment one of the methyl groups is sticking more up and the other one is lying more down at the interface, the entire isopropyl group rotates by 40° after plasma treatment.
From Soup: 51 The next system that will be discussed is the PI surface before and after 100 s He plasma treatment. The PI polymer has no SFG signal in the CH stretching frequency region, but it has very strong signal in the C O stretching frequency region due to the two carbonyl groups. The polymer PI has been well studied by SFG, 44,76,77 but not in the presence of He plasma. The PI surface was studied via SFG and ATR-FTIR (the spectra are in Fig. 6 ). Similar to the PS surface, very strong SFG signal prior to plasma treatment was observed. There are two peaks in the SFG spectrum at 1735 cm −1 and 1775 cm −1 , which correspond to the antisymmetric and symmetric stretching modes for coupled C O groups associated with each imide ring of the PI polymer, respectively. For the plasma treated PI surface there is actually no SFG signal detected, which is corroborated by previous plasma studies with Ar gas, 44 indicating a completely disordered surface or C O groups completely lying down. There are six peaks present in the ATR-FTIR spectrum ( Fig. 6 ) that come from PI, 1776 cm −1 , ν (C O) of imide; 1718 cm −1 , ν (C O) of imide; 1607 cm −1 , C–N/N–H coupled deformation of amide; 1505 cm −1 , breathing mode of aromatic ring; 1454 cm −1 , CH 2 asymmetric deformation; 1378 cm −1 , (C–N–C) of imide. 78 The ATR-FTIR results show that there is PI before and after plasma treatment and there is negligible difference, as shown by the difference ATR-FTIR spectrum ( Fig. 6 ).
 ###### 
From cou.: 52 Such orientation changes may decrease the SFG signal intensity. As we presented above, SFG signals detected from epoxy at the dPS (after plasma treatment)/epoxy interface indeed do decrease. The decrease of the SFG signal could also be due to a broader orientation distribution (i.e. a broader distribution of tilt angles) or a lower number density of methyl groups at the interface in addition to the average orientation angle effect. A more broad distribution of tilt angles means a more randomly orientated or more disordered interface. The lack of order could come from interfacial diffusion, where there is no longer a well-defined boundary at the interface, which has been observed previously.33,36 The interfacial diffusion will increase the adhesion strength. Unfortunately, here we could not determine the orientation and orientation distribution at the same time. Therefore we could not discuss this effect quantitatively.
From Soup: 52 We then investigated the buried PI/epoxy interface and SFG spectra were collected from epoxy/PI (before and after 100 s He plasma) interfaces ( Fig. 7 ). The 1735 cm −1 and 1775 cm −1 peaks from PI correspond to the antisymmetric and symmetric stretch modes for coupled CO groups associated with each imide ring of the PI polymer. Before plasma treatment for both the surface and buried interface the two peaks are very strong, after treatment there is no detected signal, which is corroborated by previous plasma studies with Ar gas. 44 The SFG spectra collected from the PI surface and buried pristine PI/epoxy interface have the same two peaks, but the spectral profiles are different, which could be due to the local environment of the PI/air versus the PI/epoxy interfaces, leading to different orientations of the C O groups. The PI/air and PI/epoxy interfaces have been previously investigated with similar epoxies and it was found that the SFG spectra of PI at air interface and epoxy interface can be drastically different. 44 After the plasma treatment on PI, no SFG signal could be detected from the C O groups on the PI surface in air or PI/epoxy interface. As our analysis on the dPS above, likely C O groups lose surface coverage, or lie down completely or have a random distribution. Again we refer the latter two cases to disordering. Here we believe that the PI molecules are more disordered at the PI (after plasma treatment)/epoxy interface along with some loss of surface coverage.
 ###### 
From cou.: 53 The SFG signal intensity decrease can also be caused by the reduction in number density of the methyl groups at the interface. Using the known hyperpolarizability components and the deduced orientation (by assuming a certain distribution), by taking the ratio of χAfter(2)/χBefore(2), the ratio of NAfter/NBefore can be determined (Here “After” and “Before” mean after and before plasma treatment). Here two vibrational modes were used, the χyyz,sym and χyzy,Asym, to deduce this ratio, yielding 0.72 and 0.71 respectively. The two independent measurements lead to a similar result, showing that there is about a 30% decrease in the methyl group coverage at the interface (if assuming the same orientation distribution). This data suggests that the methyl interfacial coverage at the dPS/epoxy interface is indeed reduced at the dPS/epoxy interface after the dPS surface is plasma treated. From the above discussion, it is clear that the SFG signal intensity decrease at the dPS (after plasma treatment)/epoxy interface is due to the (CH3)2C orientation change, a broader distribution, a smaller interfacial coverage, or a combination. As we reported previously, both interfacial disordering and less methyl coverage at the interface led to higher adhesion.36 We therefore believe that the plasma treatment increases the adhesion strength by creating a more disordered interface with fewer methyl groups at the polymer/epoxy interface. (See below.)
From Soup: 53 SFG spectra were also taken in the C–H stretching frequency region from the buried interface ( Fig. 7 ). As with the dPS/epoxy system, the PI (without plasma treatment)/epoxy interface yields very strong ssp and sps SFG signals, while SFG spectra collected from the PI (with 100 s He plasma treatment)/epoxy interface have greatly reduced intensity. These C–H stretching SFG signals detected are solely due to the epoxy. In each sps spectrum there is one peak present at 2960 cm −1 that can be assigned to the methyl antisymmetric stretch. 34 The ssp spectrum can be fitted using five peaks at 2855 cm −1 (CH 2 sym ), 2870 cm −1 (CH 3 sym ), 2915 cm −1 (CH 2 asym ), 2943 cm −1 (FR), and at 2970 cm −1 (CH 3 asym ). In order to perform orientation calculations, all the sps and ssp spectra were fitted (ESI, † Fig. S2 and Table S2).
 ###### 
From cou.: 54 We also used ATR-FTIR to probe the epoxy bulk near the epoxy/dPS interface. As we discussed above, the ATR-FTIR probes ∼800 nm into the sample, therefore it can probe 700 nm into the epoxy region.33 The ATR-FTIR spectra collected from the sample of dPS polymer (before and after 100 s He plasma) in contact with epoxy can be found in Fig. 5. In addition to the four peaks from the dPS film, there are three peaks present in the C–H stretching frequency region at 2870 cm−1, 2930 cm−1, and 2965 cm−1, which can be assigned to the epoxy methyl symmetric stretch, methylene antisymmetric stretch, and methyl antisymmetric stretch, respectively.75 Before and after plasma treatment of dPS, the same signal was observed from the interfaces, showing that we could not observe any differences from the interfacial region (∼800 nm) between dPS (before and after He plasma treatment) and epoxy. This demonstrated that if there is any adhesion difference, it must be due to the interface effect, caused by the plasma treatment on the dPS surface.
From Soup: 54 Assuming different orientation distributions and using the detected χ yyz , sym / χ yzy , asym ratios, the deduced tilt angles of epoxy isopropyl groups at the PI (without plasma treatment)/epoxy and PI (with 100 s He plasma treatment)/epoxy interfaces are: (1) for delta distribution, 24.9 ± 0.9° and 58.0 ± 3.5°; (2) for the σ = 3° Gaussian distribution, 26.1 ± 1.0° and 60.3 ± 2.7°; (3) for the σ = 5° Gaussian distribution, 25.4 ± 0.9 and 61.2 ± 2.8°; (4) for the σ = 10° Gaussian distribution, 22.1 ± 0.8 and 65.8 ± 3.0°, respectively. Similarly, using the measured χ yyz , asym / χ yzy , asym ratios, such tilt angles are: (1) for delta distribution, 21.0 ± 0.8° and 49.8 ± 5.0°; (2) for the σ = 3° Gaussian distribution, 20.5 ± 0.8° and 49.9 ± 5.0°; (3), for the σ = 5° Gaussian distribution, 19.5 ± 0.8 and 50.0 ± 5.0°; (4) for the σ = 10° Gaussian distribution, 13.9 ± 0.5 and 50.7 ± 5.1°, respectively.

From cou.: 55 The next system that will be discussed is the PI surface before and after 100 s He plasma treatment. The PI polymer has no SFG signal in the CH stretching frequency region, but it has very strong signal in the CO stretching frequency region due to the two carbonyl groups. The polymer PI has been well studied by SFG,44,76,77 but not in the presence of He plasma. The PI surface was studied via SFG and ATR-FTIR (the spectra are in Fig. 6). Similar to the PS surface, very strong SFG signal prior to plasma treatment was observed. There are two peaks in the SFG spectrum at 1735 cm−1 and 1775 cm−1, which correspond to the antisymmetric and symmetric stretching modes for coupled CO groups associated with each imide ring of the PI polymer, respectively. For the plasma treated PI surface there is actually no SFG signal detected, which is corroborated by previous plasma studies with Ar gas,44 indicating a completely disordered surface or CO groups completely lying down. There are six peaks present in the ATR-FTIR spectrum (Fig. 6) that come from PI, 1776 cm−1, ν(CO) of imide; 1718 cm−1, ν(CO) of imide; 1607 cm−1, C–N/N–H coupled deformation of amide; 1505 cm−1, breathing mode of aromatic ring; 1454 cm−1, CH2 asymmetric deformation; 1378 cm−1, (C–N–C) of imide.78 The ATR-FTIR results show that there is PI before and after plasma treatment and there is negligible difference, as shown by the difference ATR-FTIR spectrum (Fig. 6).
From Soup: 55 Similar to the discussion on the dPS/epoxy interfaces presented above, here the average tilt angles measured with two ratios under the distribution of σ = 10° will be used for comparison. The tilt angle of isopropyl groups at the PI (without plasma treatment)/epoxy interface is 18.0 ± 1.0, more or less standing up at the interface. After the PI was treated by 100 s He plasma, the epoxy isopropyl group tilt angle at the PI (plasma treatment)/epoxy interface is much larger, at 58.3 ± 6.4°, lying down more at the interface ( Table 1 has tilt angles listed). The same trend which is seen for the PI/epoxy systems was observed from the dPS/epoxy system, as reported above. Similar tilt angles of epoxy isopropyl group at dPS (without plasma)/epoxy interface (15.3 ± 0.8) and PI (without plasma)/epoxy interface (18.0 ± 1.0) were observed. Also similar tilt angles of epoxy isopropyl groups at dPS (after plasma)/epoxy interface (51.0 ± 9.5°) and PI (after plasma)/epoxy interface (58.3 ± 6.4°) were observed. This shows that the epoxy isopropyl groups likely have a similar interaction with dPS and PI surface before plasma treatment. This is possible because both dPS and PI have aromatic ring structures. Then plasma treated dPS and PI surfaces alter the interaction with epoxy (that are both more disordered) at the polymer (after plasma treatment)/epoxy interface), so at the buried plasma treated polymer/epoxy interfaces, epoxy isopropyl groups lie down more.
 ###### 
From cou.: 56 We then investigated the buried PI/epoxy interface and SFG spectra were collected from epoxy/PI (before and after 100 s He plasma) interfaces (Fig. 7). The 1735 cm−1 and 1775 cm−1 peaks from PI correspond to the antisymmetric and symmetric stretch modes for coupled CO groups associated with each imide ring of the PI polymer. Before plasma treatment for both the surface and buried interface the two peaks are very strong, after treatment there is no detected signal, which is corroborated by previous plasma studies with Ar gas.44 The SFG spectra collected from the PI surface and buried pristine PI/epoxy interface have the same two peaks, but the spectral profiles are different, which could be due to the local environment of the PI/air versus the PI/epoxy interfaces, leading to different orientations of the CO groups. The PI/air and PI/epoxy interfaces have been previously investigated with similar epoxies and it was found that the SFG spectra of PI at air interface and epoxy interface can be drastically different.44 After the plasma treatment on PI, no SFG signal could be detected from the CO groups on the PI surface in air or PI/epoxy interface. As our analysis on the dPS above, likely CO groups lose surface coverage, or lie down completely or have a random distribution. Again we refer the latter two cases to disordering. Here we believe that the PI molecules are more disordered at the PI (after plasma treatment)/epoxy interface along with some loss of surface coverage.
From Soup: 56 Similar to the dPS case, the SFG signal collected from the PI (after plasma)/epoxy interface is weaker compared to that from the PI (before plasma)/epoxy interface. In addition to the orientation effect, orientation distribution can also influence the SFG signal intensity. Therefore the weak signal may indicate a more disordered interface. Certainly the signal decrease can be caused by less interfacial coverage of isopropyl groups. Similar to the dPS/epoxy system, here the number density of isopropyl groups can also be calculated for the PI/epoxy buried interface, assuming the signal change is caused by the different isopropyl interfacial coverages. It was found that the number density of isopropyl groups reduced to 0.57 (based on ssp sym intensity change) and 0.67 (based on sps asym intensity change) at the PI (after plasma)/epoxy interface (assuming 1.00 at the PI (without plasma treatment)/epoxy interface). The average number density of isopropyl group at the plasma treated PI/epoxy interface is 0.62. This indicates that the plasma treatment on PI caused a reduction of ∼40% interfacial coverage of methyl groups at the polymer/epoxy interface, which is similar to the dPS/epoxy system where such a reduction is ∼30%. A more disordered interface or an interface with less methyl coverage may lead to stronger adhesion, as we have published previously. 33,35,36
 ###### 
From cou.: 57 SFG spectra were also taken in the C–H stretching frequency region from the buried interface (Fig. 7). As with the dPS/epoxy system, the PI (without plasma treatment)/epoxy interface yields very strong ssp and sps SFG signals, while SFG spectra collected from the PI (with 100 s He plasma treatment)/epoxy interface have greatly reduced intensity. These C–H stretching SFG signals detected are solely due to the epoxy. In each sps spectrum there is one peak present at 2960 cm−1 that can be assigned to the methyl antisymmetric stretch.34 The ssp spectrum can be fitted using five peaks at 2855 cm−1 (CH2sym), 2870 cm−1 (CH3sym), 2915 cm−1 (CH2asym), 2943 cm−1 (FR), and at 2970 cm−1 (CH3asym). In order to perform orientation calculations, all the sps and ssp spectra were fitted (ESI,† Fig. S2 and Table S2).
From Soup: 57 For this system ATR-FTIR was also performed to verify no polymer loss and that the epoxy bulk structure is the same before and after plasma treatment. Fig. 5 shows the ATR-FTIR spectra collected from the PI (without plasma)/epoxy and the PI (after plasma)/epoxy systems. The ATR-FTIR spectra from the PI film and ∼700 nm epoxy before and after plasma treatment on PI are similar. Therefore the bulk structures of the PI/epoxy system were not altered by the plasma treatment on PI. The difference detected by SFG discussed above due to the plasma treatment is purely the interfacial effect.
 ###### 
From cou.: 58 Assuming different orientation distributions and using the detected χyyz,sym/χyzy,asym ratios, the deduced tilt angles of epoxy isopropyl groups at the PI (without plasma treatment)/epoxy and PI (with 100 s He plasma treatment)/epoxy interfaces are: (1) for delta distribution, 24.9 ± 0.9° and 58.0 ± 3.5°; (2) for the σ = 3° Gaussian distribution, 26.1 ± 1.0° and 60.3 ± 2.7°; (3) for the σ = 5° Gaussian distribution, 25.4 ± 0.9 and 61.2 ± 2.8°; (4) for the σ = 10° Gaussian distribution, 22.1 ± 0.8 and 65.8 ± 3.0°, respectively. Similarly, using the measured χyyz,asym/χyzy,asym ratios, such tilt angles are: (1) for delta distribution, 21.0 ± 0.8° and 49.8 ± 5.0°; (2) for the σ = 3° Gaussian distribution, 20.5 ± 0.8° and 49.9 ± 5.0°; (3), for the σ = 5° Gaussian distribution, 19.5 ± 0.8 and 50.0 ± 5.0°; (4) for the σ = 10° Gaussian distribution, 13.9 ± 0.5 and 50.7 ± 5.1°, respectively.
From Soup: 58 The spectral data suggests that both dPS/epoxy and PI/epoxy interfaces may be more disordered and/or have less methyl groups after plasma treatment on the polymers, which should lead to a greater adhesion strength. To confirm this, adhesion strength between epoxy and polymers before and after plasma treatment was measured. Eight or more samples were prepared for lap shear testing for each of the four systems: PS (before plasma)/epoxy, PS (after plasma)/epoxy, PI (before plasma)/epoxy, and PI (after plasma)/epoxy. Fig. 8 shows the measured adhesion data for these samples. For the PS/epoxy system, before plasma treatment the adhesion strength is 6.8 ± 0.2 MPa and after 100 s of He plasma treatment on PS, the strength increases to 8.8 ± 0.3 MPa (a 20% increase). The PI/epoxy system prior to plasma treatment on PI has an adhesion strength of 11.0 ± 0.4 MPa, and after plasma treatment on PI it increases to 14.4 ± 0.9 (also an increase of 20%). This adhesion testing data shows that if a polymer surface is plasma treated, the adhesion strength between this surface and epoxy will increase. As we stated above, we can correlate this increase in adhesion strength to the more disordered interfacial region and/or less interfacial methyl coverage (as shown by the SFG data). It is also interesting to note that the more hydrophilic polymer, PI has a stronger adhesion strength than the more hydrophobic polymer, PS, which corresponds well to the trend that more polar polymers have stronger adhesion strength than more nonpolar polymers. 33 This could be due to hydrophilic polymers having better wettability which have been shown to have better adhesion strength. 12,13
 ###### 
From cou.: 59 Similar to the discussion on the dPS/epoxy interfaces presented above, here the average tilt angles measured with two ratios under the distribution of σ = 10° will be used for comparison. The tilt angle of isopropyl groups at the PI (without plasma treatment)/epoxy interface is 18.0 ± 1.0, more or less standing up at the interface. After the PI was treated by 100 s He plasma, the epoxy isopropyl group tilt angle at the PI (plasma treatment)/epoxy interface is much larger, at 58.3 ± 6.4°, lying down more at the interface (Table 1 has tilt angles listed). The same trend which is seen for the PI/epoxy systems was observed from the dPS/epoxy system, as reported above. Similar tilt angles of epoxy isopropyl group at dPS (without plasma)/epoxy interface (15.3 ± 0.8) and PI (without plasma)/epoxy interface (18.0 ± 1.0) were observed. Also similar tilt angles of epoxy isopropyl groups at dPS (after plasma)/epoxy interface (51.0 ± 9.5°) and PI (after plasma)/epoxy interface (58.3 ± 6.4°) were observed. This shows that the epoxy isopropyl groups likely have a similar interaction with dPS and PI surface before plasma treatment. This is possible because both dPS and PI have aromatic ring structures. Then plasma treated dPS and PI surfaces alter the interaction with epoxy (that are both more disordered) at the polymer (after plasma treatment)/epoxy interface), so at the buried plasma treated polymer/epoxy interfaces, epoxy isopropyl groups lie down more.
From Soup: 59 Contact angle measurements were performed to see if the polymer surface wettability changes as a function of He plasma. The PS surface was measured first and it was found that the pristine PS surface has a contact angle of 115°, 47° after 5 s of He plasma, 37° after 10 s He plasma, and 26° after 30 s He plasma treatment (see Table 2 ). The PI surface was measured next and it was found that the pristine PI surface had a contact angle of 87°, 32° after 5 s He plasma, 21° after 10 s, and too hydrophilic to measure after 30 s He plasma treatment ( Table 2 ). This data shows that as the polymer surface is plasma treated it becomes more hydrophilic and has better wettability, which we believe is related to the surface ordering/disordering.
 ###### 
From cou.: 60 Similar to the dPS case, the SFG signal collected from the PI (after plasma)/epoxy interface is weaker compared to that from the PI (before plasma)/epoxy interface. In addition to the orientation effect, orientation distribution can also influence the SFG signal intensity. Therefore the weak signal may indicate a more disordered interface. Certainly the signal decrease can be caused by less interfacial coverage of isopropyl groups.

A more disordered interface or an interface with less methyl coverage may lead to stronger adhesion, as we have published previously.33,35,36
From Soup: 60 In addition to the measured data, there is also evidence in the literature that as PS is treated with He plasma, the contact angle decreases and, in addition, there is more oxygen present at the polymer surface. 79 In this reference the contact angle goes from 92° to 36° after 10 s He plasma and 34° after 25 s plasma, which is a similar trend that was found in our work. Differences in the values could be due to different PS samples, e.g. , different Mw and Mn. In addition to contact angle, research also collected XPS data and found that the O/C ratio of the PS surface went from 0.07 before plasma to 0.26 after 10 s He plasma, which stayed the same after 25 s He plasma treatment, showing that even He plasma can increase the O/C ratio of the PS. Because helium is an inert gas, the plasma is not capable of directly reacting with the free radicals generated at the surface of the PS. Thus, all active radicals go unreacted until they are exposed to the ambient atmosphere, at which time reaction with oxygen, carbon dioxide, water and other species can occur. 80 Other studies also showed the surface oxygen content increased. For example, PS surface O content goes from 2 to 10%, 81 PI goes from an O/C ratio of 23% to 26% after 90 s of He plasma. It is clear that the surface has more oxygen after plasma, but is far from the domination of oxygen after the plasma. 82 The C content decrease detected from PS surface after He plasma treatment may indicate phenyl group loss. Therefore, the observed adhesion increase also may be contributed by the increased oxygen content on the polymer surface. This is in addition to the surface disordering and less coverage of interfacial methyl groups, which will be investigated further in the future.
 ###### 
From cou.: 61 For this system ATR-FTIR was also performed to verify no polymer loss and that the epoxy bulk structure is the same before and after plasma treatment. Fig. 5 shows the ATR-FTIR spectra collected from the PI (without plasma)/epoxy and the PI (after plasma)/epoxy systems. The ATR-FTIR spectra from the PI film and ∼700 nm epoxy before and after plasma treatment on PI are similar. Therefore the bulk structures of the PI/epoxy system were not altered by the plasma treatment on PI. The difference detected by SFG discussed above due to the plasma treatment is purely the interfacial effect.
From Soup: 61 Surface modification with plasma treatment is a complex process, involving surface group reorientation, and free radicals and polar groups created by the plasma (which can then recombine to trigger branching and crosslinking). 83 It is generally held that pendant groups at the surface of a polymer will re-orient toward or away from the bulk in order to minimize the interfacial free energy. 84 It was also reported that the surface modification, in the presence of He plasma, can be due to oxidation and/or crosslinking caused by the radicals created on the surface. Oxidation can be proved with XPS, but crosslinking cannot. 79 In one study it was found that the oxygen and nitrogen tend to bond to common carbon atoms, to form amide groups on the PS surface when He plasma is used. 81 In this study, as we discussed, we focused on the He plasma effect on the orientation/ordering change of surface groups.

From cou.: 62 The spectral data suggests that both dPS/epoxy and PI/epoxy interfaces may be more disordered and/or have less methyl groups after plasma treatment on the polymers, which should lead to a greater adhesion strength.

From Soup: 62 In this study, molecular structures at buried polymer/epoxy interfaces were studied in situ and noninvasively, with SFG and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, before and after He plasma treatment on the polymer surfaces. Two polymers, dPS and PI, were studied in this research. PS was investigated as a model polymer and PI as a more industrially relevant polymer that has been widely used in microelectronics. It is worth noting that this is the first report on the relationship of the buried interfacial structure (after plasma treating the original surface) and adhesion. Here we selected He plasma which introduces less complexity and we want to demonstrate the feasibility of the interfacial structure and adhesion relationship study. In the future, it is important to systematically vary the plasma treatment conditions and investigate how to optimize the adhesion. In this research we showed that adhesion failure occurred. Even for adhesion failure, we believe that it is important to probe the buried interface in situ instead of studying the exposed separated surfaces because the buried interfacial structure likely will be different after the interface is broken, because the interfacial interaction was destroyed when separating the materials at the interface.

From cou.: 63 Contact angle measurements were performed to see if the polymer surface wettability changes as a function of He plasma. The PS surface was measured first and it was found that the pristine PS surface has a contact angle of 115°, 47° after 5 s of He plasma, 37° after 10 s He plasma, and 26° after 30 s He plasma treatment (see Table 2).

Differently, for both dPS and PI cases, after the polymer surface was plasma treated, the SFG signals collected from polymer (after plasma treatment)/epoxy interfaces exhibit no polymer signals and much weaker epoxy signals. We showed that such signal decreases are caused by interfacial disordering, interfacial functional group orientation change and/or reduced coverage of methyl groups at the interfaces. Such structural changes lead to interfacial adhesion strength increase, shown by our adhesion testing data. Our ATR-FTIR results demonstrated that the bulk interfacial region (polymer film + hundreds of nanometers into the epoxy material) did not change after plasma treating the polymer surface. Therefore the varied adhesion was solely caused by the interfacial change. In this study, we also quantitatively analyzed the SFG data and deduced the epoxy isopropyl group orientation at both polymer/epoxy interfaces before and after plasma treating the polymer surfaces. For both the dPS and PI cases, epoxy isopropyl tilt angle ( vs. the surface normal) became much larger at the polymer (after plasma treatment)/epoxy interface compared to that of the polymer (before plasma treatment)/epoxy interface. In addition, water contact angle measurements were also performed and it was found that the polymer surfaces have better wettability after He plasma and this could also promote the adhesion strength.

From Soup: 64 As we discussed above, adhesion is a complex phenomenon and many factors could contribute to interfacial adhesion. It is believed that interfacial structure greatly influences adhesion. SFG is a unique and powerful technique which can probe the molecular structures at buried interfaces in situ , without the need to break the interfaces. Here we indeed observed the structural differences of both polymer and epoxy at the buried polymer/epoxy interface before and after the polymer was plasma treated. We believe that such structural differences caused by polymer plasma treatment led to different adhesion between polymer and epoxy.
