From cou.: 1 The application of a genetic algorithm, for optimizing the geometries of stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric MgO clusters, bound by a simple Coulomb-plus-Born–Mayer potential, is investigated. The genetic algorithm is shown to be efficient and reliable for finding, reproducibly the global minima for these clusters. The variation of the structures of MgO clusters are investigated as a function of the formal charges (±q) on the ions—ranging from q=1 to q=2. In agreement with previous studies, lower charges are found to favour compact, rocksalt-like cuboidal clusters, while the higher formal charges favour hollow pseudo-spherical structures. Hexagonal stacks are also found to be stable for small (MgO)N clusters with N=3n. Comparisons are made with experimental mass spectral abundances and the results of previous empirical calculations, as well as with more sophisticated model potential and ab initio calculations. Finally, possible ways in which the genetic algorithm search method could be coupled with more accurate calculation methods are discussed.

From cou.: 2 Ionic clusters are derived from ionic solids—compounds formed between electropositive metals and electronegative non-metals. The bonding in ionic clusters is primarily due to electrostatic interactions, and the simplicity of modelling ionic clusters makes them ideal systems in which to study size-dependent properties.1–3 Ionic clusters also have a growing number of practical applications, such as: silver halides in the photographic process; ZnS clusters as gas sensors; CdS and CdSe clusters as photodetectors; and polar semiconductors made from GaAs and InP clusters. The study of NaCl and NaBr clusters is also important in determining the mechanisms of ozone depletion and pollution in marine environments.

From cou.: 3 There have been many experimental and theoretical studies of clusters of magnesium oxide (MgO), perhaps because it is the simplest ionic oxide species, crystallising in the rock salt (NaCl) structure. It is also hoped that a detailed understanding of the growth of (MgO)N clusters will lead to an improved understanding of epitaxial growth of MgO surfaces. MgO clusters have also been invoked as possible nucleation sites for the formation of particulate matter in oxygen-rich regions of space.

From cou.: 4 In the late 1980s, Saunders published mass spectra and collision-induced fragmentation data for sputtered stoichiometric MgO cluster ions, (MgO)N+ (6≤N≤24), and found magic number peaks for N=6, 9, 12 and 15.4,5 These results were interpreted in terms of clusters built from hexagonal (MgO)3 sub-units. In the early 1990s, Ziemann and Castleman also studied (MgO)N+ clusters (N≤90), which were generated in a gas aggregation source and investigated using laser-ionization time of flight mass spectrometry.6,7 They found magic number clusters for (MgO)N+ at N=2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 27 and 30—again showing a regular gap of 3 MgO “molecules”. For larger clusters, however, Ziemann and Castleman interpreted the mass spectral abundances in terms of MgO clusters having compact cuboidal (rock salt) structures, similar to those observed for alkali-halide clusters,2 and postulated that even the smaller clusters may have structures based on compact packing of Mg4O4 cubes.7

From cou.: 5 By varying the experimental conditions (e.g. by varying the flow rate of the carrier gas in a gas aggregation cluster source), Ziemann and Castleman also detected non-stoichiometric, Mg-rich (MgO)NMg+ (N≤90) and (MgO)NMg2+ (4≤N≤172) cluster ions.6–8 In the case of the (MgO)NMg+ and (MgO)NMg2+ clusters, magic numbers were observed for N=8, 11, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25 and 278 (as well as (MgO)35Mg+). These peaks were attributed to compact cuboidal (or defective cuboidal) structures.7,8

From cou.: 8 It is well known that the oxide anion (O2−) is unstable in the gas phase, because of electron–electron repulsion, spontaneously losing an electron. The oxide ion is stabilized in the bulk crystal by the electrostatic crystal field (the Madelung potential), but it is likely that, especially in small clusters, the oxygen species are not present as formal, rigid O2− ions. Alternative approaches for circumventing this problem are: to introduce partial covalency (electron sharing) by reducing the formal ionic charges; or to include dipole (and possibly higher) polarization terms of the oxide ion, thereby acknowledging that the outer electron density of the O2− ion is easily deformed in a way which depends on the number, and arrangement, of surrounding cations. The polarization of the oxide anion allows for partial screening of the repulsive interactions between cations, as well as lowering the energy of the oxide ions themselves. The polarizability of the much smaller Mg2+ cation is some three orders of magnitude smaller than that of O2− and so can be ignored.22

From cou.: 10 Whether one is using empirical potentials or ab initio theory to describe the bonding in clusters, one of the principal objectives is to find, for a given cluster size, the arrangement of atoms (or ions or molecules) corresponding to the lowest potential energy, i.e. the global minimum (GM) on the potential energy hypersurface. However, as the number of minima rises quasi-exponentially with increasing cluster size, finding the global minimum becomes increasingly difficult23 and traditional Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulated annealing approaches often encounter difficulties finding global minima for particular types of interatomic interactions.24 It is for this reason that genetic algorithms have found increasing use in the area of cluster geometry optimization.

From cou.: 11 The genetic algorithm (GA)25–28 is a search technique based on the principles of natural evolution. It employs operators that are analogues of the evolutionary processes of genetic crossover, mutation and natural selection to explore multi-dimensional parameter spaces. A GA can be applied to any problem where the variables to be optimised (genes) can be encoded to form a string (chromosome), each string representing a trial solution of the problem. The GA operators exchange information between the strings to evolve new solutions. The GA approach operates in a parallel manner—many different regions of parameter space are investigated simultaneously, with information concerning different regions of parameter space being passed between the individual strings by the crossover procedure. In this way, genetic information is disseminated throughout the population.

From cou.: 13 The rigid ion model presents a simple description of the bonding in ionic solids and their clusters, in which the ions are of fixed size and carry fixed charges. The interaction between a pair of ions is given by the sum of the long range electrostatic Coulomb energy and a repulsive Born–Mayer potential (which reflects the short range repulsive energy due to the overlap of the electron density of the ions):where, qi and qj are the charges on ions i and j, rij is the inter-ion distance and Bij and ρij are Born–Mayer energy and distance scaling parameters, respectively.

From cou.: 14 The potential parameters, listed in Table 1, were derived by Lewis and Catlow,35 for formal charges of Mg2+ and O2−. As will be described below, we have also used this potential to study clusters with charges varying between ±1 and ±2. Because we have not reparametrized the potential upon changing the ion charges, the energies of the clusters cannot be directly compared for different charges and we will therefore concentrate on qualitative changes in structures of the global minimum structures. It should be noted that, because of the small size of the cations, there are no repulsive Mg2+–Mg2+ (or Mg+–Mg+) Born–Mayer terms.

From cou.: 18 For a given cluster nuclearity (N), a number of clusters, Npop (typically ranging from 10 to 30) are generated at random to form the initial population (the “zeroth generation”). The real-valued cartesian x, y and z coordinates are chosen randomly in the range [0, N1/3] (and then scaled by the characteristic length, re, of the potential). This ensures that the cluster volume scales correctly with cluster size, i.e. linearly with N. Each cluster is then relaxed by locally minimizing the cluster potential energy as a function of the cluster coordinates.

From cou.: 19 Each cluster is assigned a fitness value, based on its total potential energy (Vclus), such that low energy clusters (more negative Vclus) have high fitness and high energy clusters (less negative Vclus) have low fitness. In this work we have used a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function, with the fitness (Fi) of the ith member of the population (with Vclus=Vi) given by:where dynamic fitness scaling is achieved by introducing the dimensionless quantity ρ:and Vmax and Vmin are the Vclus values of the highest and lowest energy clusters in the current population.

From cou.: 20 The selection of parents for mating is accomplished using a variant of the roulette wheel method.26 A cluster is picked at random and is accepted for mating if its fitness value (Fi) is greater than a randomly generated number between 0 and 1 (i.e. if Fi>R[0,1]). If the candidate cluster is rejected for mating, then another is picked and the process is repeated. In this way, low energy clusters (with high fitness values) are more likely to be selected for mating and, therefore, to pass on their structural characteristics. Although a particular cluster may be chosen more than once for mating, within each pair of parents, the same cluster cannot be chosen twice. Once a pair of parents have been selected for mating, they are subjected to the crossover operation.

From cou.: 21 Crossover is carried out using a modified version of the cut and splice crossover operator of Deaven and Ho.37 In our implementation of the cut and splice operation, as shown schematically in Fig. 2, random rotations (about two perpendicular axes) are performed on both parent clusters and then both clusters are cut horizontally—parallel to the xy plane and complementary fragments are spliced together. For single-element clusters, this is accomplished by ranking the coordinates of the component atoms of each rotated cluster in order of decreasing z coordinate and then selecting the first (highest z) N−M coordinates from the first parent and the last (lowest z) M coordinates from the second parent and combining them to generate a single offspring cluster with N atoms.

From cou.: 22 For heteroatomic clusters, such as ionic clusters, the crossover procedure has been modified in order to preserve the correct number of atoms of each type in the cluster. It is not possible to simply cut and splice the clusters about an arbitrary position as there is no guarantee that the correct stoichiometry would be retained. A weighted splice position, Npos, is instead generated (calculated from the relative fitness values). The first 1 to Npos atoms are copied from the first cluster, irrespective of the atom type. The number of atoms of each type, Ntype1 and Ntype2, copied during this process are counted. The remainder of the cluster is then formed from the Ntype1+1 to Natoms1 atoms of type one and the Ntype2+1 to Natoms2 atoms of type 2 from the second parent.

From cou.: 24 While the mating/crossover operation leads to a mixing of genetic material in the offspring, no new genetic material is introduced. In an attempt to avoid population stagnation (i.e. to maintain population diversity), a mutation operator is introduced. Within our GA, mutation is performed on the set of Nmat offspring, with each offspring cluster having the same probability (Pmut) of being mutated.

From cou.: 26 Rotate mutation involves rotation of the upper half of the cluster relative to the bottom half, by a random angle about the z axis.
From Soup: 26 After mutation, clusters are again locally minimized. The form of the rigid ion potential is such that the potential becomes highly attractive at very short range. If a mating or mutation operation places two atoms of opposite charge very close together, then on minimization of the energy, the cluster collapses due to the attractive −1/ r term overcoming the repulsive Born–Mayer term (which has an exponential form). In the modified program, therefore, if the energy of the cluster is very low after energy minimization, signifying that the cluster has collapsed, then a new cluster is generated at random to replace it. The energy of the new cluster is then relaxed to the nearest local minimum. A brief study of “atom-replacement” mutation (involving randomly moving a small number of atoms 34 ) showed that this mutation scheme was inefficient, as there was too great a tendency to generate structures which collapse upon minimization.
 ###### 
From cou.: 27 Exchange mutation permutes the atom types of a pair of atoms without perturbing the structure of the cluster. Approximately N/3 atom label swaps are performed per cluster mutation.
From Soup: 27 The next stage of the GA involves selecting the N pop lowest energy clusters to form the next generation. The set of N pop “old” clusters (from the previous generation) and N mat “new” clusters (offspring and mutants) are ranked in order of potential energy. The top N pop clusters ( i.e . those with lowest energy) are then selected to constitute the next generation. This selection process is the analogue of natural selection in biological evolution.

From cou.: 30 The whole process of mating, mutation and selection is repeated for a specified number (Ngen) of generations.
From Soup: 30 Fig. 3 shows the percentage efficiency of the GA, measured over 20 different runs of the GA, for clusters of 20 to 70 ions ( i.e . (MgO) 10 –(MgO) 35 ), for formal charges of Mg + and O − (see following discussion). The success of the GA was assessed according to how often the lowest energy (assumed global minimum) structure was found. For these calculations, the GA parameters were: roulette wheel selection, with the tanh fitness function and fitness-weighted crossover; N pop = 20; N mat = 16; and both exchange and rotate mutations were compared (with P mut = 0.05). The GA was run for a maximum of N gen = 200 generations.

From cou.: 31 Graphical representations and atomic coordinates of the clusters found as global minima by our GA search program (some of which are discussed below) can be found on the Birmingham Cluster Web page.38
From Soup: 31 As can be seen in Fig. 3 , the efficiency of the GA lies in the range 70–100% for all of the cluster nuclearities considered, with two exceptions—for 50 ((MgO) 25 ) and 54 ((MgO) 27 ) ions. The GA results are also generally very reproducible. The global minimum of the 50-ion cluster has a 5 × 5 × 2 cuboidal structure, while the slightly higher energy (metastable) isomers of (MgO) 25 have structures based on the more cubic 4 × 4 × 3 48-ion cluster. It is difficult for the GA operators to construct the 5 × 5 × 2 structure from those based on the 4 × 4 × 3 structure, which is reflected in the relatively low efficiency (5%, i.e . only once in 20 runs) of the GA in locating the 5 × 5 × 2 structure. Of course, this reduces the confidence with which we can say that we have found the GM for (MgO) 25 . The low efficiency of the GA in locating the 54-ion global minimum cluster (25% or 45%, depending on the mutation operator) has a similar origin, as this structure has a 6 × 3 × 3 cuboidal configuration, which again is significantly different from the structures of clusters based on the 4 × 4 × 3 structure. Doye and Wales have carried out a detailed study of the dynamics of the (NaCl) 35 Cl − cluster, showing that interconversion between different family of rock salt cuboids can be a slow process. 39–41 Different isomers of charged NaCl clusters have also been detected and distinguished by Dugourd, Jarrold and co-workers, on the basis of their differing mobilities in drift tube experiments. 42 These workers have also studied the dynamical interconversion of NaCl cluster isomers. 43

From cou.: 32 Fig. 3 shows the percentage efficiency of the GA, measured over 20 different runs of the GA, for clusters of 20 to 70 ions (i.e. (MgO)10–(MgO)35), for formal charges of Mg+ and O− (see following discussion). The success of the GA was assessed according to how often the lowest energy (assumed global minimum) structure was found. For these calculations, the GA parameters were: roulette wheel selection, with the tanh fitness function and fitness-weighted crossover; Npop=20; Nmat=16; and both exchange and rotate mutations were compared (with Pmut=0.05). The GA was run for a maximum of Ngen=200 generations.
From Soup: 32 Fig. 3 also shows that changing the mutation operator has little effect on the efficiency of the GA, in fact the graphs overlap for most nuclearities. This is probably because structures with adjacent ions of the same charge are strongly discriminated against on energy (and hence fitness) grounds, so that the exchange mutation operation is very unlikely to lead to low energy mutants. We have found, however, that this mutation operation is useful in determining the global minima of mixed-metal alloy clusters, where there is no repulsive interaction between species of the same type. 34,44
 ###### 
From cou.: 33 As can be seen in Fig. 3, the efficiency of the GA lies in the range 70–100% for all of the cluster nuclearities considered, with two exceptions—for 50 ((MgO)25) and 54 ((MgO)27) ions. The GA results are also generally very reproducible. The global minimum of the 50-ion cluster has a 5×5×2 cuboidal structure, while the slightly higher energy (metastable) isomers of (MgO)25 have structures based on the more cubic 4×4×3 48-ion cluster. It is difficult for the GA operators to construct the 5×5×2 structure from those based on the 4×4×3 structure, which is reflected in the relatively low efficiency (5%, i.e. only once in 20 runs) of the GA in locating the 5×5×2 structure. Of course, this reduces the confidence with which we can say that we have found the GM for (MgO)25. The low efficiency of the GA in locating the 54-ion global minimum cluster (25% or 45%, depending on the mutation operator) has a similar origin, as this structure has a 6×3×3 cuboidal configuration, which again is significantly different from the structures of clusters based on the 4×4×3 structure. Doye and Wales have carried out a detailed study of the dynamics of the (NaCl)35Cl− cluster, showing that interconversion between different family of rock salt cuboids can be a slow process.39–41 Different isomers of charged NaCl clusters have also been detected and distinguished by Dugourd, Jarrold and co-workers, on the basis of their differing mobilities in drift tube experiments.42 These workers have also studied the dynamical interconversion of NaCl cluster isomers.43
From Soup: 33 The ions in MgO have formal charges of Mg 2+ and O 2− , but, following the approach of Ziemann and Castleman, 7 we have used the cluster GA to optimize the geometries of stoichiometric (MgO) N clusters ( N = 10–35), with formal ionic charges of Mg + O − , as well as Mg 2+ O 2− . The same GA parameters were used as in the first study, though only the rotate mutation operation was adopted.

From cou.: 34 Fig. 3 also shows that changing the mutation operator has little effect on the efficiency of the GA, in fact the graphs overlap for most nuclearities. This is probably because structures with adjacent ions of the same charge are strongly discriminated against on energy (and hence fitness) grounds, so that the exchange mutation operation is very unlikely to lead to low energy mutants. We have found, however, that this mutation operation is useful in determining the global minima of mixed-metal alloy clusters, where there is no repulsive interaction between species of the same type.34,44
From Soup: 34 The binding energies per ion ( E b ) of these clusters are listed in Table 2 and the structures of the Mg + O − and Mg 2+ O 2− clusters are shown in Fig. 4 and 5 , respectively, for 10 to 35 ion pairs. The lowest energy Mg + O − clusters can be seen to be compact cuboidal structures based on the NaCl structure (the structure of bulk MgO), whereas the Mg 2+ O 2− clusters are more spherical, hollow, cage-like structures with square, hexagonal and octagonal faces. The shorter equilibrium bond length of a pair of doubly charged ions forces all ions closer together in the cluster, which increases the repulsion between like ions. The repulsion is much greater between ions of like charges in the Mg q + O q − clusters with q = 2, compared with those with q = 1. This causes the cluster structures to open out from highly coordinated cuboids for q = 1 to hollow cages for q = 2. 7
 ###### 
From cou.: 35 The ions in MgO have formal charges of Mg2+ and O2−, but, following the approach of Ziemann and Castleman,7 we have used the cluster GA to optimize the geometries of stoichiometric (MgO)N clusters (N=10–35), with formal ionic charges of Mg+O−, as well as Mg2+O2−. The same GA parameters were used as in the first study, though only the rotate mutation operation was adopted.
From Soup: 35 The rigid ion potential does not contain any terms to describe the polarization of ions in a system, and, as the O 2− ions are highly polarizable and the Mg 2+ ions are strongly polarizing, the rigid ion model provides a poor description of Mg 2+ O 2− clusters. The effect of polarization will be to reduce the effective charges of both ions, thereby reducing the repulsion felt between like ions. This will lead to the more highly coordinated (bulk-like) cuboidal structures being preferred over the cage like structures, due to the higher degree of bonding present. The rigid ion model calculations used singly charged ions in order to mimic, partially the effect of polarizability. Calculations using potentials that include explicit terms for the polarizability of the cluster ions 17 and ab initio 13–16 calculations predict cubic structures to be the group state configurations of MgO clusters, at least for clusters of upwards of 20–30 ion pairs. It should be noted, however, that the ab initio calculations have, by necessity, involved searching rather small regions of configuration space, close to bulk-like geometries or those produced from more exhaustive rigid ion model searches.
 ###### 
From cou.: 36 The binding energies per ion (Eb) of these clusters are listed in Table 2 and the structures of the Mg+O− and Mg2+O2− clusters are shown in Fig. 4 and 5, respectively, for 10 to 35 ion pairs. The lowest energy Mg+O− clusters can be seen to be compact cuboidal structures based on the NaCl structure (the structure of bulk MgO), whereas the Mg2+O2− clusters are more spherical, hollow, cage-like structures with square, hexagonal and octagonal faces. The shorter equilibrium bond length of a pair of doubly charged ions forces all ions closer together in the cluster, which increases the repulsion between like ions. The repulsion is much greater between ions of like charges in the Mgq+Oq− clusters with q=2, compared with those with q=1. This causes the cluster structures to open out from highly coordinated cuboids for q=1 to hollow cages for q=2.7
From Soup: 36 As mentioned in the introduction, the experimental mass spectra of Ziemann and Castleman 6–8 showed magic number clusters (corresponding to relatively intense peaks): for (MgO) N + at N = 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 27, and 30; for (MgO) N Mg + at N = 8, 11, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, and 27; and for (MgO) N Mg 2+ at N = 8, 11, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, and 27. These results have been interpreted in terms of clusters with compact cuboidal (rock salt) structures, as predicted by the rigid ion model for ionic charges of +1 and −1, 7 though Wilson and others have postulated that some of the magic numbers ( i.e. those with N = 3 n ) may be due to hexagonal stacks or “ nanotubes ”. 15,17
 ###### 
From cou.: 37 The rigid ion potential does not contain any terms to describe the polarization of ions in a system, and, as the O2− ions are highly polarizable and the Mg2+ ions are strongly polarizing, the rigid ion model provides a poor description of Mg2+O2− clusters. The effect of polarization will be to reduce the effective charges of both ions, thereby reducing the repulsion felt between like ions. This will lead to the more highly coordinated (bulk-like) cuboidal structures being preferred over the cage like structures, due to the higher degree of bonding present. The rigid ion model calculations used singly charged ions in order to mimic, partially the effect of polarizability. Calculations using potentials that include explicit terms for the polarizability of the cluster ions17 and ab initio13–16 calculations predict cubic structures to be the group state configurations of MgO clusters, at least for clusters of upwards of 20–30 ion pairs. It should be noted, however, that the ab initio calculations have, by necessity, involved searching rather small regions of configuration space, close to bulk-like geometries or those produced from more exhaustive rigid ion model searches.
From Soup: 37 Ziemann and Castleman have also performed calculations based on the rigid ion model, 7 using two different Born–Mayer repulsive potentials and formal charges of q = 1 and 2. They found similar trends in the structures to those produced by our GA optimization: namely cuboidal structures for q = 1 and cage structures for q = 2. For singly charged ions with fewer than 20 or 50 ions, however (depending on which Born–Mayer potential was used), structures based on stacked hexagons or octagons were found to be competitive with the cuboidal geometries, which is consistent with the calculations of Wilson. 17 In fact, Wilson has stated that the occurrence of low-lying hexagonal stack structures makes the MgO clusters more similar to those of LiF or NaI, rather than NaCl or KCl. 17 The occurrence of hexagonal structures for LiF and NaI clusters has been attributed to polarization effects. 17 In the case of NaI, this is due to the relatively high polarizability of the large iodide anion. For LiF clusters, however, although the fluoride anion is significantly less polarizable than the heavier halide anions , the polarizing effect of the small Li + cation is much larger than that of Na + or K + .
 ###### 
From cou.: 38 As mentioned in the introduction, the experimental mass spectra of Ziemann and Castleman6–8 showed magic number clusters (corresponding to relatively intense peaks): for (MgO)N+ at N=2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 27, and 30; for (MgO)NMg+ at N=8, 11, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, and 27; and for (MgO)NMg2+ at N=8, 11, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, and 27. These results have been interpreted in terms of clusters with compact cuboidal (rock salt) structures, as predicted by the rigid ion model for ionic charges of +1 and −1,7 though Wilson and others have postulated that some of the magic numbers (i.e. those with N=3n) may be due to hexagonal stacks or “nanotubes”.15,17
From Soup: 38 As shown in Fig. 4 , for (MgO) N clusters (with N in the range 10–35) the cluster GA found clusters with complete cuboidal lattice structures for Mg + O − ) N clusters with N = 12 (4 × 3 × 2), 15 (5 × 3 × 2), 16 (4 × 4 × 2), 18 (4 × 3 × 3), 20 (5 × 4 × 2), 24 (4 × 4 × 3), 25 (5 × 5 × 2), 27 (6 × 3 × 3), 30 (5 × 4 × 3) and 32 (4 × 4 × 4)). Most of these match the magic numbers observed experimentally by Ziemann and Castleman. 7
 ###### 
From cou.: 39 Ziemann and Castleman have also performed calculations based on the rigid ion model,7 using two different Born–Mayer repulsive potentials and formal charges of q=1 and 2. They found similar trends in the structures to those produced by our GA optimization: namely cuboidal structures for q=1 and cage structures for q=2. For singly charged ions with fewer than 20 or 50 ions, however (depending on which Born–Mayer potential was used), structures based on stacked hexagons or octagons were found to be competitive with the cuboidal geometries, which is consistent with the calculations of Wilson.17 In fact, Wilson has stated that the occurrence of low-lying hexagonal stack structures makes the MgO clusters more similar to those of LiF or NaI, rather than NaCl or KCl.17 The occurrence of hexagonal structures for LiF and NaI clusters has been attributed to polarization effects.17 In the case of NaI, this is due to the relatively high polarizability of the large iodide anion. For LiF clusters, however, although the fluoride anion is significantly less polarizable than the heavier halide anions, the polarizing effect of the small Li+ cation is much larger than that of Na+ or K+.
From Soup: 39 The structures found by the GA for the global minima of (Mg 2+ O 2− ) N clusters (see Fig. 5 ) are very similar to those found by Ziemann and Castleman, 7 though there are some differences, notably for (MgO) 13 , where their structure has a basket-plus-handle geometry, with two ions having only two neighbours, while ours is more compact. This may be due to their having used a different Born–Mayer repulsive potential, although it is possible that their search algorithm (which is essentially a random search procedure) did not find the true global minimum for some of these clusters. On the basis of previous work, however, it should be said that the structures produced for the rigid ion model, with formal charges of ±2 are incompatible with the observed mass spectra and are, therefore, unlikely to represent the true structures of MgO clusters.

From cou.: 40 As shown in Fig. 4, for (MgO)N clusters (with N in the range 10–35) the cluster GA found clusters with complete cuboidal lattice structures for Mg+O−)N clusters with N=12 (4×3×2), 15 (5×3×2), 16 (4×4×2), 18 (4×3×3), 20 (5×4×2), 24 (4×4×3), 25 (5×5×2), 27 (6×3×3), 30 (5×4×3) and 32 (4×4×4)).

From Soup: 43 The largest peaks in the second difference plot for Mg + O − clusters correspond to structures having complete i × j × k cuboidal lattice structures (see Fig. 4 ), as such structures maximise the number of attractive cation –anion contacts. The peaks in E 2nd correspond to the peaks in dissociation energy (for loss of MgO units) calculated by Ziemann and Castleman for (Mg + O − ) N clusters, within the rigid ion model, 7 both being in good agreement with the most intense peaks in the mass spectrum of MgO clusters.

From Soup: 44 It should be noted that the lowest energy structure for (Mg + O − ) 21 ( N ions = 42) is not a 7 × 3 × 2 cuboid, but rather it has a step structure. This may be because the very aspherical cuboidal structure has too high a surface area and hence a lower binding energy. This may also explain the relatively low binding energy of (Mg + O − ) 25 ( N ions = 50), since the 5 × 5 × 2 cuboid is very flat and again has a high surface energy, though apparently, for this geometry there is no alternative geometry of lower energy.

From cou.: 46 3.2.1 Enantiomeric clusters.
From Soup: 46 For many of the cluster geometries found by the GA, enantiomers (non-super-imposable mirror-image structures) exist, due to the loss of mirror planes of symmetry in clusters composed of two distinct species. The enantiomers of the GM (Mg 2+ O 2− ) 30 structure are shown in Fig. 7 . Of course, these enantiomers have identical binding energies.

From Soup: 47 Evolutionary progress plots (EPPs), 45 showing the convergence of the GA on the lowest energy (MgO) 30 clusters, with formal charges of ±1 and ±2 are shown in Fig. 8 . The figure shows that the GA required 74 generations to find the lowest energy structure of (Mg 2+ O 2− ) 30 but only 7 generations to find the lowest energy structure of (Mg + O − ) 30 . In both cases the minimum, maximum and average energies converge, indicating that the GA has converged on a single solution. The GA converges in 27 generations for q = 1 and in 100 generations for q = 2. These results are typical of the other cluster nuclearities studied. The rigid-ion potential with formal charges of ±2 is shorter ranged and the potential energy surface is therefore likely to have more local minima for the GA to search, leading to greater difficulty in finding the global minimum.

From Soup: 48 It should be noted that population convergence does not always signify that the GA has found the true GM, as premature convergence (stagnation), on a sub-optimal solution (a local minimum), is also possible. Population convergence corresponds to a loss of population diversity. Although premature convergence cannot be seen in Fig. 8 (assuming that we have found the true GM in both cases), previous studies have shown that premature convergence is not necessarily disastrous for our GA, 33,34 since diversity can be reintroduced into a population either by mutation or by crossover. The nature of the Deaven and Ho crossover operation, for example, means that, even for two identical parents, a variety of distinct offspring can be generated.

From Soup: 49 As noted above, MgO clusters with formal ionic charges of ±1 and ±2 have different structures. To investigate the dependence of structure on charge further, we have studied the effect, on the lowest energy structures of small (Mg q + O q − ) N clusters, of varying the magnitude of the charge ( q ) in incre-ments of 0.1 from 1.0 to 2.0. In the following discussion, our results are compared with work by de la Puente et al. , 15 who studied neutral MgO clusters of between 6 and 13 ion pairs using HF (Hartree–Fock) and CHF (Coulomb–Hartree–Fock 46 ) ab initio techniques. The CHF method is a “perturbed ion” approach which includes intra-ion electron correlation corrections. Reference will also be made to the work of Recio et al. , 13 who performed HF and HF + MP2 (inclusion of second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory to account for electron correlation) calculations on MgO clusters. It should be noted, however, that these ab initio calculations were restricted to a number of assumed geometries, as an exhaustive search of the potential energy surface is ruled out due to excessive computational requirements. Finally, some comparison will be made with the rigid ion model calculations of Ziemann and Castleman. 7

Both of these structures are found to be low energy configurations for both sets of calculations by de la Puente, with the HF calculations predicting the cage structure to be the global minimum. The HF calculations of Recio also find the cage-like structure to be lowest in energy, with an alternative structure, based on a hexagonal prism with a vertical, rather than horizontal edge bridged by an MgO unit, lying at slightly higher energy. The rigid ion model calculations of Ziemann and Castleman predict a monocyclic ring geometry for (Mg 2+ O 2− ) 7 , 7 as opposed to the stacked ring structures found for the N = 6 and N = 8 clusters. This is presumably a consequence of the inefficient search method adopted.

Two more open structures can both be generated by lengthening different Mg–O contacts in the 4 × 2 × 2 cuboid.

The structure found when the charges are equal to 1.0 is a 4×3×2 lattice, the structure found when the charges are between 1.1 and 1.5 consists of 4 stacked MgO hexagons and the structure found when the charge is 1.6 or higher is the pseudo-spherical truncated octahedron, formed from MgO squares and hexagons. These three different structures are the three lowest energy isomers published by de la Puente for (MgO)12 clusters, with the truncated octahedron being the ground state configuration, for both HF and CHF calculations. The HF calculations of Recio predicted the hexagonal stack to lie lower in energy than the 4×3×2 cuboid — though they did not investigate the more spherical truncated octahedron, which was also found to be most stable by Ziemann and Castleman, within the rigid ion model, for q=2.
From Soup: 57 As shown in Fig. 15 , the geometry of the (MgO) 13 cluster, for q = 1.0–1.5 is that of a 3 × 3 × 2 lattice with an octagonal Mg 4 O 4 ring stacked above one of the 3 × 3 faces. This structure has an oxide ion at the centre. An alternative way of viewing this structure is as an O-centred 3 × 3 × 3 cube, with a Mg ion missing from the centre of one of the 3 × 3 cube faces, which then distorts to form an octagon. The ground state structure calculated by de la Puente, at both the HF and CHF levels, has the same oxide -ion centred geometry, with an analogous Mg-centred structure at higher energy. The lowest energy structure calculated by Recio et al. is an O-centred 3 × 3 × 3 cube, with a corner, rather than a face, (Mg) ion missing. The HF and CHF calculations of de la Puente et al. indicate, however, that this structure is higher in energy than the face-defect structure, which implies that Redo et al. did not search enough of the configuration space. When the charge is raised to 1.6 (or above) the resulting structure is a cage with square, hexagonal and octagonal faces. The lowest energy structure predicted by Ziemann and Castleman for (Mg 2+ O 2− ) 13 has a basket-shaped geometry, corresponding to a truncated octahedron, with one of the cluster edges replaced by an Mg–O unit.

From Soup: 58 It is interesting to note that these calculations have shown structures with oxide ions in the centre to be lower in energy than those with Mg ions in the centre. De la Puente et al. have attributed this to the enhanced electrostatic interaction stabilising highly charged anions in more highly coordinated sites, 15 although later arguments, based on anion polarizability, appear to contradict this. 19,20

From Soup: 59 Recio et al. have extracted effective (Mulliken) ionic charges from their HF calculations, 13 showing that the charges range from ±0.81 in the MgO molecule to +1.45(Mg) and −1.34(O) for the 5-coordinate ions in (MgO) 12 . Average ionic charges in (MgO) 12 are ±1.19, with the corresponding calculated charges of the 6-coordinated ions in bulk MgO (with the NaCl structure) being ±1.85.

From Soup: 60 De la Puente and colleagues have shown that the effect of introducing electron correlation is to stabilize the hexagonal structures relative to cuboidal structures, 15 so that the transition to bulk-like rock salt structures is shifted to higher nuclearities, a situation which is reversed relative to alkali halide clusters. These hexagonal structures correspond to those found for the rigid ion model, with relatively high ( i.e. close to ±2) formal charges. Ion polarization, on the other hand, tends to favour more compact, cuboidal structures, corresponding to rigid ion model calculations for low ( i.e. close to ±1) charges. The existence of approximately equi-energetic hexagonal and cuboidal families of clusters, explains the experimental mass spectra of MgO clusters 4–7 well.

From Soup: 61 As mentioned in the Introduction, in addition to stoichiometric MgO cluster, the experiments of Saunders 4,5 and of Ziemann and Castleman 6–8 also resulted in the generation of non-stoichiometric (MgO) N Mg + and (MgO) N Mg 2+ clusters. The GA was therefore used to search for the global minima of non-stoichiometric (Mg q + O q − ) N Mg q + clusters with N in the range 5–29, for q = 1 and q = 2.

The GA was therefore used to search for the global minima of non-stoichiometric (Mgq+Oq−)NMgq+ clusters with N in the range 5–29, for q=1 and q=2.
From Soup: 62 The trends in the geometries of the clusters are similar to those seen in the geometries of the stoichiometric clusters: clusters with ions of charges ±1 tend to be cuboidal structures and those with ions of charges ±2 are cage-like. This is to be expected as the same factors influence the geometries of the stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric clusters modelled with the rigid ion potential. The same cluster geometries are found for N = 12 and N = 13 (MgO) N Mg q + clusters, for both singly and doubly charged ions. The N = 12 cluster has a Mg 4 O 5 3 × 3 square array of ions with two Mg 4 O 4 rings stacked above it. The N = 13 cluster is a 3 × 3 × 3 cube. The ab initio (perturbed ion plus polarization) calculations of Aguado et al . on non-stoichiometric (MgO) N Mg 2+ clusters, 19 indicate that the additional Mg 2+ cation stabilises cuboidal geometries relative to hexagonal stacks. Such cuboidal structures are consistent with some of the intense mass spectral peaks measured by Ziemann and Castleman. 7,8 The preference for cuboidal structures, even at low nuclearities may be because these clusters have an odd number (2 N + 1) of ions, allowing complete cuboidal clusters ( i , j , k ) to be constructed when the product i × j × k is odd, whereas hexagonal prismatic clusters must possess an even number of ions. It has also been shown that the excess charge in these non-stoichiometric (or “defect”) clusters is screened more effectively in cubic clusters. 19

From Soup: 63 The second differences in the binding energies, calculated using the rigid ion model for (Mg + O − ) N Mg + clusters, are shown in Fig. 16 . The most stable clusters, corresponding to large second difference peaks, are those with 27 and 45 ions ( i.e. N = 13 and 22). The rigid ion model calculations of Ziemann and Castleman (with q = 1) also predict these clusters to be particularly stable with respect to loss of MgO molecules. 7 Both of these clusters have cuboidal lattice structures: the 27-ion cluster being an O-centred 3 × 3 × 3 cube and the 45-ion cluster being a 5 × 3 × 3 cuboid, as shown in Fig. 17 . These clusters were found to be magic number clusters by Ziemann and Castlemann. 7

From Soup: 64 It is interesting to note that the ab initio perturbed ion plus polarization calculations of Aguado et al. do not find complete cubes or cuboids to be most stable for (MgO) N Mg 2+ clusters with N = 13 and 22. 19 Instead they find flatter defective cuboids in this size range. They have attributed this finding to the fact that the 3 × 3 × 3 and 5 × 3 × 3 complete cuboids possess one and two central (bulk-like) oxide anions, respectively, which are octahedrally coordinated by six Mg cations . Although there is a greater electrostatic (Madelung) stabilization of the oxide anion in this environment, such a configuration is higher in energy than structures in which the oxide ions are all on the surface of the cluster. Oxide ions in low-coordination (and low-symmetry) surface sites have greater polarizabilities, leading to a greater stabilising polarization contribution to the cluster binding energy. Both the 3 × 3 × 3 cube and the 5 × 3 × 3 cuboid have Mg cations at the low-coordinate corner sites. Aguado et al. argue that greater polarization stabilization is gained if these sites are occupied by the much more polarizable oxide anions. This conclusion is supported by the fact that Aguado's calculations predict the Mg-deficient clusters (MgO) 13 O 2− and (MgO) 22 O 2− to have 3 × 3 × 3 and 5 × 3 × 3 structures, respectively, with oxide ions at the corners and fewer 6-coordinate oxides . 19,20 Considering larger (MgO) N Mg 2+ clusters, Aguado et al. predict that bulk-like (more 3-dimensional) cuboids, with a greater number of internal oxide ions, begin to dominate after N = 24. 19

From Soup: 65 It should be noted that these results of Aguado et al. 19,20 (although giving good agreement with experimental magic numbers and dissociation energies) are in marked disagreement with the earlier findings of the same group 15 and may reflect an over-estimation of the polarization contribution to cluster cohesion. Further studies of the structures and fragmentation patterns of stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric MgO clusters, at a higher level of theory, may help to determine the true structures of these clusters.

From Soup: 67 We have found that the GA, in combination with the rigid ion potential, is able to predict geometries of small MgO clusters that agree reasonably well with the geometries predicted on the basis of ab initio calculations. The cage-like structures predicted by the GA and the rigid-ion model for MgO clusters with formal charges of ±2, however, do not, in general, agree with experimental evidence or higher level ab initio calculations. If the formal charges are reduced towards ±1 then the structures predicted by the GA are in agreement with experimental evidence and higher level ab initio calculations. These alternative structures are either cuboidal structures, based on the bulk NaCl structure, or hexagonal stacks. Complete i × j × k cuboidal structures and hexagonal stacks are consistent with magic numbers found in the mass spectra of MgO clusters. 4–7 As there is always some ambiguity in the interpretation of mass spectral data, alternative information, such as is afforded by ion mobility measurements, 42 may enable the determination of the actual structures of (MgO) N and (MgO) N Mg q + clusters, as a function of size. In this way, some of the disagreements between ab initio , as well as empirical, calculations may be cleared up.

From Soup: 68 The deficiency in the rigid ion model that leads to the prediction of the incorrect structures of clusters formed from doubly charged Mg and O ions is the lack of inclusion of the polarizability of the ions (especially that of the oxide anion). The effect of polarizability can be partially mimicked by reducing the formal charges of the cluster ions, and this was shown, in some cases, to give rise to clusters with the correct structures. As Wilson has pointed out, however, the use of partial charges is not desireable if one wishes to produce models which are transferable over a wide range of nuclearities and conformations. 17 In his study of MgO clusters, Wilson adopted a compressible ion model, 47 with coordination number-dependent ionic polarizabilities, which were parametrized to HF calculations. 17 This model is evidently superior to the polarizable ion shell model adopted by Ziemann and Castleman, 7 which was found to lead to little improvement in the agreement between calculated and experimental cluster abundances for high (±2) formal charges.

From Soup: 69 Wilson's search of configuration space was not exhaustive, being limited to pre-determined “plausible” structures (cuboids, hexagonal stacks etc. ). 17 In future, it would be desirable to combine this model with a robust search algorithm, such as the GA, described here, to explore the potential energy surface of MgO clusters more fully. The global minima from these polarizable ion model calculations could then be investigated by correlated ab initio molecular orbital calculations. An alternative approach, developed by Hartke, 48–50 would be to couple empirical and ab initio calculations, within a GA framework, with a limited number of ab initio data points being used to reparametrize the empirical potential “on-the-fly”.

From Soup: 70 Investigation of clusters with intermediate, non-integer charges was found, in many cases, to lead to alternative, low-energy structures, some of which were also found to be low in energy by ab initio calculations. However, there appears to be no well-defined point (value of q ) at which a change in geometry occurs and some geometries remain unchanged across the entire charge range (at least from q = 1–2). As the Coulomb plus Born–Mayer potential of Lewis and Catlow 35 constrains MgO to adopt the NaCl structure in the bulk limit, it would be interesting to study the size at which bulk-like structures take over from hexagonal or cage-like structures, for formal charges of ±2 and to compare these results with the polarizable ion model and ab initio calculations.
