From Soup: 0 Preparation and characterization of the new ligand 3,5-diacetyl-1,2,4-triazol bis(4N-p-chlorophenylthiosemicarbazone), H5L1, and its bimetallic complexes [Pd(μ-H3L1)]2 and [Pt(μ-H3L1)]2, are described. The molecular structure of the complexes, determined by single crystal X-ray crystallography, reveals that each ligand coordinates, in an asymmetric dideprotonated form, to the metal ions in a square planar geometry. The new compounds synthesized have been evaluated for antiproliferative activity in vitro against NCI-H460, T-47D, A2780 and A2780cisR human cancer cell lines. The cytotoxicity data suggest that these compounds may be endowed with important antitumor properties, especially H5L1, since they exhibit excellent antiproliferative activity surpassing the activity of cisplatin against three of the four tumor cell lines studied. The DNA binding ability of H5L1 and [Pt(μ-H3L1)]2 with calf thymus DNA in Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH = 7.2) was explored by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and viscosity measurements. These data indicated that both compounds bind to DNA by a groove binding mode.

From Soup: 1 Cisplatin is one of the most active chemotherapeutic agents available for the treatment of a number of solid tumors. The main cellular target of the drug is assumed to be DNA, specifically the formation of 1,2-intrastrand cross-link adducts that force the DNA to kink toward the major groove. These DNA distortions can effectively block the cell division and finally trigger cell death. 1–3

From Soup: 2 Unfortunately the clinical utility of cisplatin is restricted due to the frequent development of drug resistance, the limited spectrum of tumors against which this drug is active and also the severe normal tissue toxicity. These disadvantages have driven the development of improved platinum-based anticancer drugs whose structure and mode of action differ from that of cisplatin, especially those that interact with specific molecular targets as for example are the processes associated with DNA: transcription, replication and repair. 4–8

From Soup: 3 In this regard, of particular interest are compounds targeting ribonucleotide reductase (RR), an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, which are the building blocks for the de novo DNA synthesis in all living cells. Cancer cells require increased RR activity to meet the demand for deoxyribonucleotides that are needed to support their rapid proliferation. Thus inhibition of RR activity leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair, and also induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. 9–11

From Soup: 4 The α-(N)-heterocyclic thiosemicarbazones have been reported to be among the most effective RR inhibitors identified yet. They constitute an important and versatile class of chelate ligands with highly interesting biological properties due to the important number of free ligands and derived metal complexes that have shown antimicrobial, antiviral or antitumor activity. 12–16 For thiosemicarbazone metal complexes multiple antitumor mechanisms of action have been proposed which in addition to the inhibition of RR include (a) covalent binding to the nitrogen bases of DNA hindering or blocking base replication, (b) creation of lesions in DNA strands by oxidative rupture and (c) binding with DNA through non-covalent interactions such as H-bonding, intercalation, electrostatic interactions or groove binding. 17–21

From Soup: 11 The infrared spectral bands most useful for determining the mode of coordination of this ligand are the ν(C N) iminic and ν(C S) thioamide IV vibrations. However, the high delocalization and the asymmetric coordination only induce minor changes in these bands hindering the IR analysis. Specifically, in the spectra of metal complexes the ν(C N) band appears slightly shifted to higher wavenumbers and the ν(C S) thioamide IV band has decreased in intensity.

From Soup: 12 The 1H NMR spectrum of the free ligand shows various peaks at low fields: δ = 14.75 ppm assigned to the triazolic proton, δ ∼ 11.3 ppm assigned to the >C N–2NH– protons and δ ∼ 10 ppm assigned to the –C(S)–4NH– protons. In the 1H NMR spectra of the complexes the absence of any signals above 13 ppm together with the presence of only one signal assigned to >C N–2NH– protons is consistent with the asymmetric dideprotonation of the ligands.

From Soup: 15 This neutral Pd(II) complex crystallizes in the monoclinic P21/n space group with Z = 4 and its crystallographic analysis reveals unambiguously a dimeric structure, which results from the pairing of two metal centers through two thiosemicarbazone bridging moieties.

From Soup: 16 Each Pd(II) center is four-coordinated with a [N2S2] donor environment, via one triazole nitrogen atom and the azomethine nitrogen, one sulfur atom belonging to the deprotonated arm of a ligand, and a sulfur atom from the neutral arm of the other ligand. Thus, the deprotonated thiosemicarbazone arm behaves as bidentate and the neutral one behaves as monodentate, so that the ligand acts as a bridge.

From Soup: 17 The bond angle data ( Table 1 ) indicate that the stereochemistry around each palladium(II) ion is almost planar. The angles deviate slightly from that expected for a regular square planar geometry, although this distortion may be attributed to the restricted bite angle of the tridentate moieties. Coordination results in the formation of two five-membered (PdSCNN and PdNCCN) chelate rings for each palladium(II) ion, which are coplanar with the deprotonated triazole ring.

The C–N and N–N bond distances are intermediate between formal single and double bonds, pointing to extensive delocalization over the entire 3,5-diacetyl-1,2,4-triazole bis(thiosemicarbazone) skeleton.

From Soup: 19 Interestingly, the flexibility of the ligand originating from the free rotation of the two thiosemicarbazone arms allows each ligand the coordination to two metal ions in a twisted conformation generating two parallel coordination planes. The interplanar separation between the two triazole moieties is 3.302 Å, which is considered optimal for π–π interactions (intramolecular stacking). 27 This arrangement is reinforced by double intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the 2NH of the bridging thiosemicarbazone moieties and the uncoordinated triazole nitrogen atoms.

From Soup: 30 Of particular relevance is the value of the resistance factor RF (defined as IC50 in A2780cisR/IC50 in A2780) of 1.1 versus 8.8 for cisplatin. An RF value of <2 is considered to denote non-cross-resistance and therefore this compound is able to circumvent cisplatin resistance. 28,29 This ability to overcome cisplatin resistance in A2780cisR cells is in agreement with our previous studies on H5L3 suggesting that the mechanisms of resistance to cisplatin – most likely reduced drug transport, enhanced DNA repair and elevated GSH levels – are scarcely effective toward these 3,5-diacetyl-1,2,4-triazol bis(4N-substituted-thiosemicarbazones). Upon complexation, the [Pt(μ-H3L1)]2 complex demonstrated a moderate inhibitory effect against A2780 and T-47D cells while the related [Pt(μ-H3L3)]2 retained the activity in the four cell lines assayed. Interestingly, H5L1, H5L3 and [Pt(μ-H3L3)]2 compounds were more cytotoxic than cisplatin against T-47D cells.

From Soup: 34 The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the typical B-form DNA exhibits a characteristic π→π* band at 260 nm as a consequence of the chromophoric groups in purine and pyrimidine moieties. Compounds binding with DNA through intercalation are consistent with hypochromism (decrease in DNA band absorption), resulting from a stacking interaction between the aromatic ligand chromophore and the base pair of DNA. In the case of compounds binding with DNA through external contact (including groove binding and electrostatic attraction) usually hyperchromism (increase in DNA band absorption) is observed which is attributed to contraction and overall damage of the secondary structure of DNA. 30

As shown in Fig. 4 and 5 , when the concentration of H5L1 or [Pt(μ-H3L1)]2 is gradually increased a significant increase in absorption of the DNA band occurs with the percentage of hyperchromism observed [% hyperchromism = (ADNA bound − ADNA free)/ADNA bound] about 22% for H5L1 and 37% for [Pt(μ-H3L1)]2.

From Soup: 36 The observed hyperchromic effect suggests that both compounds bind to CT-DNA by external contact. 31 These characteristics are comparable to those previously reported for various neutral bis(thiosemicarbazone)palladium and platinum complexes and for which a non-covalent binding along outside of the DNA helix surface (major or minor groove) was proposed. 24,32

Thus, in order to determine the intrinsic binding constant (Kb), absorption titration experiments were performed by maintaining a constant concentration of the desired compound while gradually increasing the concentration of CT DNA and monitoring the change in the absorption intensity of one of the intraligand charge transfer bands (for the H5L1 ligand the band at λmax 320 nm was used whereas for [Pt(μ-H3L1)]2 with less resolved bands the band at λmax 255 nm was chosen). While measuring the absorption spectra, an equal amount of CT DNA was added to both the test solution and the reference solution to eliminate the absorbance of CT DNA itself.

From Soup: 38 A plot of [DNA]/(εa − εf) versus [DNA] gives a slope of 1/(εb − εf) and a Y-intercept equal to 1/{Kb(εb − εf)}. The intrinsic binding constant Kb is calculated as the ratio of the slope to the Y-intercept.
 ######

From Soup: 39 The UV spectra of H5L1 and [Pt(μ-H3L1)]2, Fig. 6 and 7 respectively, display an increase in the absorptivity upon addition of increasing amounts of CT DNA (0–50 μM), which is indicative of interactions between the electronic states of the ligand chromophores with that of DNA bases.
 ###### 
From cou.: 40 A
From Soup: 40 This change in absorbance values was used to calculate the magnitude of the intrinsic binding constant, Kb, for H5L1 and [Pt(μ-H3L1)]2 compounds, the values are 8.06 × 103 M−1 (correlation coefficient R2 = 0.97) and 1.51 × 105 M−1 (correlation coefficient R2 = 0.99) respectively.
 ###### 
From cou.: 41 ε
From Soup: 41 The higher value of Kb obtained for [Pt(μ-H3L1)]2 in comparison with that calculated for the free ligand, H5L1, suggests that the coordination to Pt(II) ions enhances significantly the ability to bind to CT DNA. On the other hand, no significant shift is observed in the UV absorption band of the [Pt(μ-H3L1)]2 complex indicating that there is no change of the coordination environment of the metal ion and this consequently discards covalent binding.
 ###### 
From cou.: 42 ε
From Soup: 42 The Kb values obtained here are lower than that reported for double-stranded DNA intercalators while they are comparable to other classical groove binders. 34,35 Therefore, these findings support the interaction of both compounds with DNA via groove binding.

From Soup: 45 Hydrodynamic methods such as determination of viscosity, which are fairly sensitive to the change of the length of DNA, are also an important tool to study the nature of binding of compounds to the DNA. Thus, the potential interaction of H5L1 and [Pt(μ-H3L1)]2 compounds with DNA was examined further by viscosity measurements. Specifically, the relationship between the relative viscosity and the contour length is of the form L/L0 = (η/η0)1/3, where L0 and η0 denote the apparent DNA molecular length and the solution viscosity, respectively, in the absence of the tested compound.

From Soup: 46 A classical intercalator molecule like ethidium bromide causes a significant increase in the viscosity of the DNA solution due to an increase in the separation of base pairs at the interaction site and an increase in the overall double helix length, whereas a groove binder agent like Hoechst 33258 does not appreciably lengthen the DNA helix and therefore causes less pronounced changes (positive or negative) or no changes in the viscosity of DNA solutions. On the other hand, cisplatin, which is known to fold DNA through covalent binding, causes a decrease in the relative viscosity of the DNA solution. 36

Both compounds exhibit similar patterns: initially, at a low concentration of the compound, a clear diminution of the viscosity is observed suggesting a bending of the DNA chain probably due to strong hydrogen bonding interactions; however, when the concentration of the compound increases, a slight increase of the viscosity is observed pointing to groove binding interactions as the dominant DNA interactions. 37,38 Thus, these results provide further support for the groove binding mode between these compounds and DNA.

 ###### 
From cou.: 68 Cell proliferation was evaluated by the sulforhodamine B assay. Cells were plated in 96-well sterile plates at a density of 1.5 × 104 (for NCI-H460), 4 × 103 (for A2780 and A2780cisR) or 0.5 × 103 (for T-47D) cells per well with 100 μL of medium and were then incubated for 24 h (A2780, A2780cisR and NCI-H460) or 48 h (T-47D). After attachment to the culture surface the cells were incubated with various concentrations of the tested compounds freshly dissolved in DMSO (1 mg mL−1) and diluted in the culture medium (DMSO final concentration 1%) for 48 h (for NCI-H460) or 96 h (for A2780, A2780cisR and T-47D). The cells were fixed by adding 50 μL of 30% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) per well.
From Soup: 68 These experiments were carried out at the Unidad de Evaluación de Actividades Farmacológicas de Compuestos Químicos (USEF), Universidad de Santiago de Compostela.
 ###### 
From cou.: 69 The plates were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h and then washed five times with distilled water. The cellular material fixed with TCA was stained with 0.4% sulforhodamine B dissolved in 1% acetic acid for 10 min. The unbound dye was removed by rinsing with 0.1% acetic acid. The protein-bound dye was extracted with 10 mM unbuffered Tris base for determination of the optical density (at 515 nm) using a Tecan Ultra Evolution spectrophotometer.
From Soup: 69 CT-DNA stock solution was prepared by dissolving the lyophilized sodium salt in Tris-buffer (NaCl 50 mM, Tris-HCl 5 mM, pH was adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH 0.5 M) by stirring for 5 hours. The CT-DNA solution was standardized spectrophotometrically 42 by using its known molar absorption coefficient at 260 nm (6600 M−1 cm−1). The ratio of the UV absorbance at 260 and 280 nm, A260/A280, was ca. 1.9, indicating that the DNA was sufficiently free of proteins. The stock solution was kept frozen until the day of the experiment.

From Soup: 71 To investigate the binding mode, spectrophotometric titrations were performed, at a fixed DNA concentration equal to 5.45 × 10−5 M, with increasing concentrations of compounds (R = [CT-DNA]/[compound]) and the absorbance change was monitored at the wavelength maximum of 260 nm after incubation (10 min at 37 °C).
 ###### 
From cou.: 72 C
From Soup: 72 To calculate the binding parameters, spectrophotometric titrations were performed with increasing concentrations of DNA (0–50 μM) at a fixed compound concentration equal to 5 μM and the absorbance change was monitored in one characteristic charge transfer band of the compound after incubation (10 min at 37 °C).
 ###### 
From cou.: 73 The inhibitory potential of compounds was measured by calculating concentration–percentage inhibition curves, these curves were fitted to the following equation:
From Soup: 73 The viscosity experiments were carried out, at a constant temperature of 25.0 ± 0.1 °C in a thermostated water bath using a water jacket accessory, at a fixed DNA concentration equal to 5.45 × 10−5 M with increasing concentrations of compounds to ratios (1/R = [compound]/[CT-DNA]) in the range 0–0.7. For all of the experiments, the desired concentration of the compound was achieved by dilution with Tris-buffer and DMSO to give homogeneous solutions containing a final concentration of 2.0% of DMSO.

From Soup: 76 Investigation of potential biological properties (cytotoxicity and DNA binding studies) of the newly synthesized compounds indicated that H5L1 showed the strongest antiproliferative activity surpassing the activity of the conventional standard cisplatin against three of the four tumor cell lines assayed. However the [Pt(μ-H3L1)]2 complex exhibited better binding with CT-DNA which was inferred from the greater magnitude of the binding, in the range of classical groove binders. Thus our results suggest that non-covalent interactions with DNA are not the unique molecular target for these compounds.
