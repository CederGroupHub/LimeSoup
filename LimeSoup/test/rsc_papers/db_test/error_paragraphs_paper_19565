From cou.: 1 The absorption and resonance Raman (RR) properties of the [(tbbpy)2Ru(tpphz)PdCl2]2+ photocatalyst have been investigated by means of time-dependent density functional theory calculations. With the intention of evaluating the accuracy of the computations, three different exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, namely B3LYP, B3LYP-35 and CAM-B3LYP, have been considered and the effects of the solvent have been described within the polarizable continuum model. It is demonstrated that the inclusion of the solvent effects within the simulations is mandatory to obtain a correct description of the excited states contributing to the first absorption band. The RR spectra of the complex have been simulated for several excitation wavelengths and have allowed an assignment of all the intense experimental bands. The calculations succeed in reproducing several aspects of the experimental absorption and RR spectra, but it is also seen that the choice of the XC functional can lead to significant differences in the simulated spectra and that none of the considered functionals succeed in reproducing all the experimental features.

From cou.: 3 In this respect, the use of resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy in conjunction with absorption spectroscopy has demonstrated to provide interesting information about the initially photoexcited state.8–10 However, the interpretation and understanding of the experimental results can be hampered by the complexity of the electronic and vibrational structures of the complexes. In that way, the use of theoretical calculations, which allow the determination of the structural and electronic properties of the compound, can in principle provide a clear connection between the spectroscopic results and the molecular properties of the complexes and, consequently, allow for an unambiguous interpretation of the experiment. However, the design of suitable computational strategies for the calculation of RR intensities is still under development. Indeed, several studies11–20 have reported simulations of RR spectra for different types of compounds and have investigated how the accuracy of the RR intensities depends on the computational method and on the inclusion of environmental effects, like a solvent. Furthermore, it was shown21,22 that the simulation approach should also be able to describe the dependence of the RR intensities with respect to the excitation wavelength. Indeed, such an effect is particularly significant in organometallic complexes, in which several electronic excited states are usually in resonance with the incoming laser frequency.

From cou.: 4 The most commonly employed method to investigate the excited state properties of organometallic complexes is time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) because of its good compromise between accuracy and computational cost. However, due to the fact that excitation in many complexes involves charge transfer, it is expected that the calculated absorption and RR properties depend on the approximated exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Therefore, in order to design an appropriate computational strategy, it is necessary to investigate how the choice of the XC functional affects the ability of the simulations to predict the spectroscopic results. In the case of absorption spectra, it has been shown4,23–26 that the use of hybrid XC functionals in association with a description of the solvent (usually using a polarizable continuum model) provides a reasonable reproduction of the absorption band-shapes and positions. However, the influence of the XC functional on the RR spectra of organometallic complexes has been less investigated in the literature22,27 and it is not clear whether an overall good reproduction of the absorption spectrum is sufficient to obtain accurate RR intensities.

From cou.: 5 In this study, three different XC functionals are considered, namely the conventional B3LYP functional, B3LYP-35 and the so-called Coulomb-attenuated B3LYP functional (CAM-B3LYP). B3LYP-35 is a modified version of the B3LYP functional that contains 35% of Hartree–Fock exchange. This functional was recently applied to a monometallic ruthenium complex22 as well as to a push–pull chromophore14 and it has shown to provide a proper description of RR spectra. The CAM-B3LYP functional28 is a hybrid long-range corrected functional and is expected to improve the description of CT states. The performance of B3LYP, B3LYP-35 and CAM-B3LYP functionals on the structures and properties of electronically excited chromophores in solution was discussed recently by Mennucci et al.29 Therefore, it is meaningful to investigate how the RR properties of organometallic complexes can be reproduced by these three XC functionals. To this aim, the present work focuses on the study of the absorption and RR properties of the ruthenium–palladium [(tbbpy)2Ru(tpphz)PdCl2]2+ complex (Fig. 1). This photocatalyst was already characterized by different experimental techniques.7,9,10 Thus, it is an ideal compound to examine theoretically, for which computational simulations can provide interesting information in order to help understanding its photophysical properties.

From Soup: 43 A program developed locally is employed to calculate the RR cross-sections and absorption spectra . This is performed through the evaluation of eqn (1) and (7) and requires the computation of the dimensionless displacements Δ e , l for all normal coordinates of each contributing electronic excited state. Because the potential energy surfaces correspond to displaced harmonic oscillators, the displacements Δ e , l were determined from the partial derivatives of the excited states electronic energy ( E e ) along the mass-weighted normal coordinates ( Q l ) evaluated at the ground state equilibrium geometry. These derivatives were obtained from the analytical derivatives of the excited state electronic energy ( E e ) along the non-mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates according to the relation where M is the matrix containing the atomic masses, L is the orthogonal matrix obtained from the solution of the ground state normal mode eigenvalue problem and it connects the mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates to the mass-weighted normal coordinates, (∂ E e /∂ Q ) 0 and (∂ E e /∂ x ) 0 are column vectors containing the derivatives along the normal coordinates and Cartesian coordinates, respectively.

Because the potential energy surfaces correspond to displaced harmonic oscillators, the displacements Δe,l were determined from the partial derivatives of the excited states electronic energy (Ee) along the mass-weighted normal coordinates (Ql) evaluated at the ground state equilibrium geometry.These derivatives were obtained from the analytical derivatives of the excited state electronic energy (Ee) along the non-mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates according to the relationwhere M is the matrix containing the atomic masses, L is the orthogonal matrix obtained from the solution of the ground state normal mode eigenvalue problem and it connects the mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates to the mass-weighted normal coordinates, (∂Ee/∂Q)0 and (∂Ee/∂x)0 are column vectors containing the derivatives along the normal coordinates and Cartesian coordinates, respectively.
From Soup: 44 Quantum chemical calculations were performed with the GAUSSIAN 09 program, 34 which provides the structural and electronic data necessary for the simulation of the RR and absorption spectra . The geometry, vibrational frequencies, and normal coordinates of the ground state were obtained by means of density functional theory (DFT) using the XC functional B3LYP. 35,36 The 28-electron relativistic effective core potential MWB 37 was used with its basis set for the ruthenium and palladium atoms, that is, 4s, 4p, 4d and 5s electrons are treated explicitly, whereas the three first inner shells are described by the core pseudopotential. The 6-31G(d) double-ζ basis set was employed for the ligands. To correct for the lack of anharmonicity and the approximate treatment of electron correlation, 38 the harmonic frequencies were scaled by the factor 0.97. The vertical excitation energies, electronic transition dipole moments and analytical Cartesian energy derivatives ( eqn (9) ) were obtained from TDDFT calculations within the adiabatic approximation with the same pseudopotential and basis set. Three different XC functionals were considered, namely B3LYP, B3LYP-35 and CAM-B3LYP. B3LYP-35 is a modified version of the Becke three parameters hybrid XC functional 35 that contains 35% of Hartree–Fock exchange. The CAM-B3LYP XC functional 28 is a hybrid long-range corrected functional, which contains different amount of Hartree–Fock exchange at short-range and at long-range. The effects of the interaction with a solvent ( acetonitrile , ε = 35.688, n = 1.344) on the geometry, frequencies, excitation energies and excited state derivatives were taken into account by the integral equation formalism of the polarizable continuum model 39 (IEFPCM). The nonequilibrium procedure of solvation was used for the calculation of the excitation energies and of the excited state derivatives, which is well adapted for processes where only the fast reorganization of the electronic distribution of the solvent is important. Finally, it should be mentioned that the four tert- butyl groups of the original catalyst ( Fig. 1 ) were approximated in the calculations by methyl groups. This allows a reduction of the computational cost of the simulations without affecting the spectroscopic properties of the complex.

From Soup: 45 The present investigation considers the RR properties for excitation wavelengths in resonance with the first absorption band of the complex. Therefore, only the electronic excited states contributing to this band need to be included in the simulations.

Therefore, only the electronic excited states contributing to this band need to be included in the simulations. Additionally, the excited states with an oscillator strength lower than 0.02 were neglected, because they provide a negligible contribution to the absorption and RR spectra.
From Soup: 46 The most intense states in the first absorption band are given in Table 1 and the simulated absorption spectra are reported in Fig. 2 together with the experimental spectrum . 9 It should be mentioned that the theoretical spectra obtained in Fig. 2 with B3LYP in vacuum, B3LYP in acetonitrile , B3LYP-35 and CAM-B3LYP need to be shifted to lower energies by 0.10, 0.14, 0.62 and 0.60 eV, respectively, so that the experimental and theoretical maxima coincide. Such an adjustment is performed in order to correct the systematic overestimation of the excited state energies. Moreover, this is necessary to ensure that the simulation of the RR spectra for different excitation wavelengths is realized under the same conditions of resonance with the first absorption band as in the experiment. Thus, it is seen that B3LYP reproduces the position of the absorption maximum with an accuracy of about 0.1 eV. This is the best precision one can expect at this level of approximation and is in agreement with previous theoretical studies on organometallic complexes. 4,40 In contrast, B3LYP-35 and CAM-B3LYP significantly overestimate the position of the absorption band by about 0.6 eV. This shows that the long-range corrected functional CAM-B3LYP does not improve the excited state energies of the complex in comparison to B3LYP and leads to a similar overestimation of the energies than the one obtained with B3LYP-35. This is also in agreement with recent studies, 22,41 which showed that B3LYP-35 and CAM-B3LYP overestimate the excitation energies in organometallic complexes.

From Soup: 47 Not only the energy position of the spectral band but also a proper reproduction of its shape is necessary, because it affects the dependency of the RR intensities with respect to the excitation wavelength. According to Fig. 2 , it is seen that the B3LYP calculations in vacuum and acetonitrile give a reasonable agreement with experiment, even if an overestimation of the intensity is found at longer wavelengths. However, B3LYP-35 presents a too intense shoulder arising from a strongly allowed excited state at about 500 nm. Finally, the spectrum obtained with CAM-B3LYP shows a band-shape in very good agreement with experiment.

From Soup: 48 All contributing excited states correspond to metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excitations involving transitions from d orbitals of the ruthenium atom to π* orbitals of the tpphz and tbbpy ligands, except state S 40 (B3LYP, vacuum), which involves transitions from two orbitals localized on the palladium and chlorine atoms to π* orbitals of the tpphz and tbbpy ligands ( Table 1 ). No state with comparable character to S 40 is found at low energies in the calculations including the effects of the solvent . Nevertheless, similar states appear at higher energies and are more likely assigned to the experimental bands observed between 250 and 400 nm. 9 Moreover, the presence of an excitation involving a CT from the palladium and chlorine atoms to the tpphz ligand at about 500 nm is in strong disagreement with recent experimental results, 9,10 showing an increase of the catalytic efficiency of the complex for laser excitations spanning the low-energy part of the MLCT absorption band. Such an effect cannot be associated with a CT excitation from the palladium and chlorine atoms to the tpphz ligand. Therefore, it is concluded that TDDFT calculations performed in vacuum strongly underestimate the energy of state S 40 and thus it is necessary to incorporate the interaction with the solvent in the simulations to get a correct description of the excited states contributing to the first absorption band. This conclusion is corroborated by the fact that excitations involving a CT from the palladium and chlorine atoms to the tpphz ligand are also present when using the CAM-B3LYP functional in vacuum (see Fig. S1 in the ESI † ). Moreover, an additional effect of the solvent in the calculations is that it reduces the number of low-energy states appearing with negligible oscillator strengths.

From Soup: 49 Besides the changes obtained between calculations in vacuum and with solvent , noticeable differences are also found in the calculations in acetonitrile using different XC functionals. These differences concern the number of states contributing to the first absorption band, their relative energy positions, their oscillator strengths and their orbital decomposition ( Table 1 ). Yet, the three calculations in acetonitrile provide a comparable picture concerning the orbitals involved in the excitations. Indeed, several MLCT states involving a CT to the tpphz ligand are found at shorter wavelengths, with mainly transitions to π* orbitals either localized on the center of the tpphz ligand (π* tpphz (231)) or on the aromatic cycles bonded to the ruthenium atom (π* tpphz (235) for B3LYP). The high-energy part of the simulated spectra is dominated by MLCT states mainly involving transitions to two π* orbitals localized on the tbbpy ligands (π* tbbpy (236) and π* tbbpy (237)). Finally, the orbital π* tpphz (232) provides also a noticeable contribution to several states with a smaller oscillator strength in the B3LYP and B3LYP-35 calculations.

Indeed, several MLCT states involving a CT to the tpphz ligand are found at shorter wavelengths, with mainly transitions to π* orbitals either localized on the center of the tpphz ligand (π*tpphz(231)) or on the aromatic cycles bonded to the ruthenium atom (π*tpphz(235) for B3LYP). The high-energy part of the simulated spectra is dominated by MLCT states mainly involving transitions to two π* orbitals localized on the tbbpy ligands (π*tbbpy(236) and π*tbbpy(237)). Finally, the orbital π*tpphz(232) provides also a noticeable contribution to several states with a smaller oscillator strength in the B3LYP and B3LYP-35 calculations.
From Soup: 50 In the case of B3LYP-35, it is seen that the differences in the excited state pattern lead to an overestimation of the band-shape width, which arises from the large oscillator strength of state S 6 . However, despite significant differences in the excited state energies and oscillator strengths, almost similar band-shapes are obtained with B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP. This suggests that even if a reasonable agreement is found between the simulated and experimental band-shapes, some important differences in the calculations can be overshadowed by the large broadening of the absorption band. Such effects might hamper the understanding of the photochemical properties of the complex if theoretical calculations are employed to interpret experimental results. However, the calculation of RR intensities allows to unravel the vibrational signatures of each contributing state. Additionally, their comparison with experimental spectra enables a better estimation of the accuracy of a given theoretical method. Furthermore, the simulation of RR spectra also allows for an evaluation whether accurate excited state properties can be obtained with B3LYP-35 and CAM-B3LYP, once the overall overestimation of the MLCT band energy is corrected to fit the experimental conditions.

From Soup: 52 The RR spectra calculated for several excitation wavelengths with B3LYP, B3LYP-35 and CAM-B3LYP are presented in Fig. 3 (for comparison, the normal Raman spectrum at 1064 nm calculated with B3LYP in acetonitrile is displayed in Fig. S2 of the ESI † ). The RR bands corresponding to vibrational modes located on the tpphz and tbbpy ligands are given in magenta and blue, respectively. It is seen that a strong increase of the RR intensities is found with all theoretical methods, when the excitation wavelength is approaching the experimental maximum of absorption at 444 nm. This emphasizes the need of a reasonable description of the absorption band-shape and band-position to obtain the correct dependency of the RR cross-sections with respect to the excitation wavelength.

From Soup: 53 The effects of the solvent on the RR intensities can be assessed by comparing the RR spectra calculated with B3LYP in vacuum and in acetonitrile . In both environments, the RR spectrum at 514 nm shows tpphz and tbbpy bands of equivalent intensity, whereas the intensity of the tbbpy vibrations is significantly enhanced with respect to the tpphz vibrations when the excitation gets closer to the maximum of absorption. It is seen that this effect is more marked in acetonitrile due to the larger contributions of the states S 15 , S 17 and S 19 , which involves a CT to the tbbpy ligands ( Fig. 2 ). The RR spectra in vacuum and acetonitrile present also some differences in their vibrational signatures. In particular, two tbbpy vibrations are RR active in acetonitrile at about 1485 cm −1 and the relative intensities of several tpphz bands are modified going from vacuum to acetonitrile . Nevertheless, the RR spectra calculated in both environments show also several similarities, as can be seen for example for the tbbpy bands. However, the tpphz intensities obtained in vacuum are certainly questionable, because they result to a large part from the contribution of state S 40 (see discussion in Section 3.1). Therefore, the RR spectrum in vacuum will no longer be discussed hereafter.

From Soup: 54 The effects of the XC functional on the RR intensities are significant, as it can be seen by comparing the spectra obtained with B3LYP with those calculated with B3LYP-35 and CAM-B3LYP. Unlike B3LYP, B3LYP-35 provides RR spectra dominated by tpphz bands, in which the tbbpy bands have only a weak intensity. This can be explained from the fact that the considered excitation wavelengths are predominantly in resonance with the strongly allowed state S 6 and that the contributions of CT transitions to the tbbpy ligands are less pronounced for this XC functional. Moreover, the RR spectra calculated with CAM-B3LYP present a rather intermediate situation between B3LYP and B3LYP-35, in which the contributions of the tpphz and tbbpy vibrations are almost equivalent. The differences between the three XC functionals also concern the most intense band at about 1485 cm −1 , which corresponds to a superposition of two tbbpy bands for B3LYP and to an additional tpphz band for B3LYP-35 and CAM-B3LYP. Furthermore, the intensity pattern in the 1250–1475 cm −1 wavenumber range is significantly different, with CAM-B3LYP showing more RR active tpphz vibrations rather than tbbpy vibrations when compared to B3LYP. Finally, it can be noticed that the relative intensities of the tbbpy and tpphz vibrations obtained at different excitation wavelengths with CAM-B3LYP are nearly constant. This is in contrast to the B3LYP and B3LYP-35 RR spectra , which show a faster increase of the tbbpy band intensities in comparison to the tpphz bands, when the excitation wavelength approaches the maximum of absorption. This difference can be understood from the distribution of the excited states contributing to the absorption band. Indeed, while B3LYP and B3LYP-35 show transitions mainly to the tbbpy ligands in the center of the absorption band and to the tpphz ligand at longer wavelengths, the CAM-B3LYP RR intensities are mainly arising from the contributions of the states S 7 and S 8 . Due to the fact that these states are close in energy, the band intensities associated with the tpphz and tbbpy ligands evolve in a similar manner when the excitation wavelength is changed.

From Soup: 56 Finally, the effects of inhomogeneous broadening and of incorporating the FC factors have been investigated. To this aim, only the absorption and RR spectra obtained with the B3LYP functional in acetonitrile have been considered. The spectra including the FC factors were calculated using eqn (5) with a damping factor Γ equal to 2000 cm −1 . Thus, it is seen in Fig. 4 that the absorption spectrum incorporating the FC factors is very close to the spectrum in which these factors are neglected. Additionally, inhomogeneous broadening effects were described by averaging the imaginary part of Φ e ( ω L ) and the Raman tensors invariants ( eqn (2) ) over a Gaussian distribution of vertical excitation energies with a FWHM equal to 2 Γ Inhomo . In order to evaluate the importance of this effect, the experimental broadening was simulated by a set of parameters ( Γ = 500 cm −1 , Γ Inhomo = 1750 cm −1 ) including a large amount of inhomogeneous broadening. Using these parameters, it is seen in Fig. 4 that the absorption spectrum including inhomogeneous broadening is very similar to the one neglecting this effect, except for the low-energy part of the spectrum . Next, the effects of FC factors and of inhomogeneous broadening were investigated on the RR spectra for the two excitation wavelengths of 458 and 496 nm ( Fig. 5 ). It is found that both effects are very small for an excitation close to the maximum of absorption (458 nm) but are larger for an excitation in the low-energy part of the absorption spectrum (496 nm). However, even for an excitation at 496 nm, the effects of incorporating FC factors and inhomogeneous broadening remain small in comparison to the differences obtained between the RR spectra calculated from different XC functionals. Therefore, such effects were not considered hereafter.

From Soup: 59 From Fig. 6 and 7 it can be seen that the simulated RR spectra are in reasonable agreement with experiment. This allows us to make an assignment of the most intense experimental bands at both excitation wavelengths. In particular, the two experimental bands at 1484 and 1490 cm −1 can be assigned to two tbbpy vibrations at 1485 and 1487 cm −1 , as well as to a tpphz vibration at 1482 cm −1 , respectively. Additionally, the three experimental bands at 1264, 1283 and 1318 cm −1 were assigned to tbbpy vibrations at 1272, 1283 and 1311 cm −1 , respectively. These assignments are also supported by experimental results on related complexes. 9 However, several RR active vibrations in the simulated spectra were not assigned to experimental bands. For example, the two tpphz vibrations at 1354 and 1356 cm −1 might be hidden in the experiment by the strong solvent band at 1375 cm −1 . Moreover, it can also be noticed that an additional tbbpy band at 1614 cm −1 is RR active in the simulated spectra . This band is not present in the experimental spectrum of [(tbbpy) 2 Ru(tpphz)PdCl 2 ] 2+ , but appears in the RR spectrum 9 of [Ru(tbbpy) 3 ] 2+ at a wavenumber of 1617 cm −1 . Similarly, the tpphz vibration calculated at a wavenumber of 1279 cm −1 can be associated with an experimental band of [(tbbpy) 2 Ru(tpphz)] 2+ at 1275 cm −1 .

From Soup: 60 By comparing the performance of the XC functionals it is seen that B3LYP mainly underestimates the contribution of the tpphz vibrations at both excitation wavelengths, whereas B3LYP-35 shows too weak tbbpy intensities. However, CAM-B3LYP provides the best agreement with experiment in the 1425–1610 cm −1 wavenumber range, but fails to reproduce the tbbpy intensities at 1272 and 1311 cm −1 , which are better obtained with B3LYP. Moreover, as can be seen from Fig. 3 , the overall decrease of the experimental RR intensities going from 458 to 496 nm is well reproduced by the three XC functionals, except for the tpphz bands at 1448 and 1459 cm −1 , which remain intense in the experimental RR spectra at both excitation wavelengths. More importantly, it is seen in experiment that going from an excitation of 458 to 496 nm, the RR intensities associated with the tbbpy vibrations decrease faster than the RR intensities associated with the tpphz vibrations. For example, this is clearly visible by comparing the relative intensities of the tbbpy bands at 1484 and 1540 cm −1 with the intensities of the four tpphz bands in the 1550–1610 cm −1 wavenumber range. This behavior can be interpreted from the simulated absorption spectra ( Fig. 2 ), which show a distribution of excited states involving more CT excitations to the tpphz ligand in the low-energy part of the spectrum and to the tbbpy ligands close to the maximum of absorption. It can be mentioned that in a recent work 10 this effect was demonstrated to be of fundamental importance for the understanding of the photocatalytic efficiency of the complex. Therefore, it is interesting to see that B3LYP and B3LYP-35 correctly reproduce the dependency of the tpphz and tbbpy relative intensities, whereas CAM-B3LYP provides almost unchanged relative RR intensities at both excitation wavelengths. This disagreement of the CAM-B3LYP spectra with the experiment highlights the fact that a good reproduction of the absorption band-shape is not sufficient to obtain an accurate dependency of the RR intensities with respect to the excitation wavelength and that a correct description of the excited state relative energies and of their excitation characters is also important.

From Soup: 61 The absorption and RR properties of the [(tbbpy) 2 Ru(tpphz)PdCl 2 ] 2+ photocatalyst have been investigated by means of DFT and TDDFT calculations employing the XC functionals B3LYP, B3LYP-35 and CAM-B3LYP. The effects of the solvent acetonitrile have been described with the IEFPCM approach. It is found that the inclusion of the solvent effects within the simulations is mandatory to obtain a proper description of the excited states contributing to the first MLCT band. Indeed, whereas calculations performed in vacuum show a low-energy excited state mainly involving a transition from the palladium and chlorine atoms to the tpphz ligand, the simulations performed in acetonitrile only show MLCT transitions from the ruthenium atom, with mainly CT transitions to the tbbpy ligands close to the maximum of absorption and to the tpphz ligand in the low-energy part of the spectrum . Next, it is found that B3LYP-35 and CAM-B3LYP overestimates the position of the absorption band by about 0.6 eV, whereas B3LYP is in excellent agreement with an overestimation of only 0.14 eV in comparison to experiment. The absorption band-shape is well reproduced by B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP, while B3LYP-35 yields a band-shape with a too strong shoulder at about 500 nm. Furthermore, the comparison between the simulated RR spectra and the experiment allows for an assignment of all the intense bands. This comparison shows also that a correct dependency of the relative tpphz and tbbpy intensities with respect to the excitation wavelength is obtained with B3LYP and B3LYP-35, whereas CAM-B3LYP provides almost unchanged relative intensities at both excitation wavelengths.

From Soup: 62 Even if the calculations succeed in reproducing several aspects of the absorption and RR spectra , it is also seen that the choice of the XC functional and in particular of the amount of Hartree–Fock exchange, can lead to significant differences in the simulated spectra and that none of the considered functionals succeed in reproducing all the experimental features. Furthermore, such differences are also likely to be dependent on the system. 22 Therefore, additional studies on related systems, which combine theoretical and experimental results, are necessary in order to have a broader view concerning the performance of TDDFT calculations. Such investigations should allow in the future a more accurate prediction of the RR intensities of organometallic complexes.
