From cou.: 1 Copper(II) complexes of a polydentate tripodal ligand L × 3HCl (L = N,N′,N′′-tris(5-pyrazolylmethyl)-cis,cis-1,3,5-triaminocyclohexane) were characterized in both solution and solid states. Combined evaluation of potentiometric, UV-VIS, and EPR data indicated the formation of two mononuclear (CuHL, CuL) and three trinuclear (Cu3H−xL2, x = 2, 3, 4) complexes. The high stability and spectroscopic properties of the CuL species indicate a coordination of two pyrazole rings in addition to the three secondary amino groups of L in a square pyramidal geometry. In parallel with the formation of trinuclear species, intense charge transfer bands appear at around 400–500 nm, which indicate the formation of pyrazolate-bridged complexes. The crystal structure of [Cu3H−4L2](ClO4)2·5H2O (1) reveals the formation of a unique trinuclear complex that features a tetra(pyrazolate)-bridged linear tricopper(II) core. The Cu⋯Cu interatomic distances are around 3.8 Å. The two peripheral copper(II) ions have a slightly distorted square pyramidal geometry. The four pyrazole rings bound to the peripheral copper(II) ions are deprotonated and create a flattened tetrahedral environment for the central copper(II), i.e. the formation of the trinuclear complexes is under the allosteric control of the two peripheral copper(II) ions. The triply deprotonated trinuclear complex is an efficient catechol oxidase mimic with a surprisingly low pH optimum at pH = 5.6. Since the mononuclear CuL species is not able to promote the oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol, we assume that the central copper(II) ion of the trinuclear complex with an unsaturated coordination sphere has a fundamental role in the binding and oxidation of the substrate. The experimental and structural details were further elaborated by a series of hybrid density functional theory calculations that support the presence of an antiferromagnetically coupled ground state. However, the magnitude and the pattern of spin coupling are dependent on the composition of the functionals. The optimized theoretical structures highlight the role of the crystal packing effects in inducing asymmetry between the two peripheral copper(II) sites.

From cou.: 2 Oligonuclear metallocenters are widespread in metalloenzymes, since the metal ions may act cooperatively to accomplish a given chemical function. Some of the functional models designed to mimic the oligonuclear motif of metalloenzymes were demonstrated to be far more active than their mononuclear counterparts.1–3 We also developed a few highly active binuclear enzyme mimics.4–11 On the other hand, a great number of low molecular weight enzyme models studied also emphasized the importance of an adequate and preorganized structure around the metal ions, which is trivially present in enzymes. Although a large number of metal complexes formed with linear/acyclic ligands were reported to possess important catalytic activity,4–6,12,13 tripodal compounds may have several advantages over the linear ones, such as a preorganized structure, a higher metal binding ability and facial coordination.14 Tripodal ligands, such as cis,cis-1,3,5-triaminocyclohexane (tach) and related compounds (1,3,5-triamino-1,3,5-trideoxy-cis-inositol (taci) and its N-methylated derivatives), are versatile ligands with several unique coordination properties.15 We and others demonstrated the important hydrolytic activity of their copper(II) complexes towards both amide16 and phosphodiester bonds.8–11,17–19

From cou.: 3 Hexadentate ligands obtained by N-substitution of tach draw considerable attention due to their ideal donor sets for metal ion coordination. The [3N3O] donor set of cis,cis-1,3,5-tris{(2-hydroxybenzyl)aminomethyl}cyclohexane forms highly stable lipophilic complexes with M(III) metal ions,20,21 and the substitution of the benzyl-ring provided a series of Mn-SOD models with tunable reduction potentials.22 Tachpyr (N,N′,N′′-tris(2-pyridylmethyl)-cis,cis-1,3,5-triaminocyclohexane) and its close derivatives also form very stable [6N] complexes with a range of transition metal ions.23–25 It is worth noting that the cytotoxicity of tachpyr is probably related to its significant metal ion binding ability.26

From cou.: 4 Derivatization of the legs of tripodal platforms provides additional donor site(s), which may influence the steric environment around the metal center, as well as help introduce additional functions, such as substrate binding or activation. The preorganization of the tripodal scaffold can be substantially increased by allosteric metal ion(s), which may create high affinity binding site(s) for the catalytic metal ion(s). In order to develop such type of oligonuclear core by allosteric interaction, the N-substituted tach ligand needs to accommodate additional metal binding site(s), for which purpose pyrazole-substituted tach derivatives are appropriate candidates. Pyrazolate-bridged metal complexes have received significant attention over the last few decades, among others, due to their unique ability to self-assemble into supramolecular architectures. Pyrazolate moieties are well suited to position two metal ions in close proximity,27,28 and such centers may efficiently mimic the function of both hydrolase29 and oxidoreductase enzymes.30

From cou.: 5 Our aim was to explore the combined advantages of the preorganized structure of tripodal scaffolds and the metal bridging ability of pyrazole rings in order to develop a new oligometallic core under allosteric control, which may potentially mimic the function of oxidase enzymes. Accordingly, we synthesized the ligand N,N′,N′′-tris(5-pyrazolylmethyl)-1,3,5-cis,cis-triamino-cyclohexane (L, tachpyz) and studied its complexes formed with copper(II) both in solution and solid states. Spectroscopically calibrated, hybrid DFT calculations were used to gain deeper insights into the electronic structure and spin-coupling scheme by considering both ferro- and antiferromagnetic ground states. To screen the enzyme mimetic properties of the copper(II) complexes their catecholase activity was studied by using 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol (H2dtbc) as a model substrate.

From cou.: 7 Tach × 3HBr (1.008 g, 2.708 mmol) was dissolved in H2O (4 mL) with NaOH (0.325 g, 8.125 mmol) to form a clear solution. Benzene (70 mL) was added and the water was removed by azeotropic distillation using a Dean-Stark trap. After cooling, the solution was rotary evaporated to a white solid. The residue was dissolved in MeOH (50 mL) and 1-H-pyrazole-5-carboxaldehyde (0.7808 g, 8.1 mmol) was added. The mixture was refluxed for 8 h. After cooling the solution, NaBH4 (0.68 g, 17 mmol) was added to reduce the Schiff-base formed. The solution was stirred for 24 h after which the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The residue was taken up in EtOH (30 mL) and the pH was set to 2 with concentrated HCl to precipitate the boric acid derivatives. After filtering, the filtrate was treated with a dry HCl gas, which resulted in precipitation of the pure L × 3HCl (Scheme 1). The product was washed with dry EtOH (50 mL) and dry Et2O (50 mL).

From cou.: 8 Crystallographic and experimental details of data collection and refinement of the structure of [Cu3H−4L2](ClO4)2·5H2O (1) are reported in Table 1. The brown complex 1 was crystallized by slow evaporation from water containing copper(II) and tachpyz in a 1.4/1 ratio at pH 8.0 held at room temperature for about 1 week. Several batches of crystals were studied by the single crystal X-ray diffraction method. XRD data collection was carried out at 293 K using Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) with a Burker-Nonius MACH3 diffractometer equipped with a point detector. Unexpectedly, the crystals diffracted rather poorly that resulted only small intensity peaks with a point detector. Several datasets were collected and merged. However, as the quality of the structure determination was still low, new datasets were collected using an Agilent SuperNova diffractometer equipped with a CCD detector at 100 K using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å). The structure was solved by the SIR-92 program32 and refined by the full-matrix least-squares method on F2. Non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters using the SHELX package.33 Disorder of the perchlorate ion could be modelled but orientation of some of the water molecules remained ambiguous resulting in checkcif errors but this does not influence the overall structure determination of the complex and only the hydrogen bond web remained somewhat uncertain. Altogether five solvent water molecules were found and one of them is distributed in two places with equal occupancy of 0.5. The hydrogen atoms of these disordered water molecules could not be located. Alternative atom type assignments in the non-bound C11–C15 and C61–C65 pyrazole rings are possible, i.e. N12 and N13 can be replaced with C15 and C14 and similarly N62 and N63 can be replaced with C65 and C64, and the locations of the pyrazole protons are also tentative. Publication material was prepared with the WINGX-suite.34 Hydrogen atoms were treated with a mixture of independent and constrained refinements. Hydrogens of the methylene and amine groups, as well as aromatic hydrogens were placed according to the ideal geometric position. Hydrogen atoms of water molecules were placed in the difference electron density map but the distances of hydrogen and oxygen atoms were restrained in the final stage of the refinement. All crystallographic data are deposited in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre under CCDC 1410354.

The complex formation constants were evaluated from seven independent titrations (∼90 data points per titration). The metal-to-ligand ratios were 2 : 1, 3 : 2, 1 : 1, and 1 : 2. At 2 : 1 and 3 : 2 ratios precipitates were observed above pH 6 and 9, respectively. Therefore, the data collected above these pH values were not used in our calculations.

From Soup: 22 The 2-electron oxidation of 3,5-di- tert -butylcatechol (H 2 dtbc, Scheme 2 ) in the presence and absence of the copper( II )–tachpyz system was monitored spectrophotometrically on a Unicam Helios α spectrophotometer by following the increase of the 3,5-di- tert -butyl- o -benzoquinone (dtbq) absorption band at 406 nm ( ε = 1900 M −1 cm −1 ). Due to the low solubility of dtbq in water, our experiments were performed in an O 2 -saturated 50% (m/m) ethanol–water mixture. A mixture of dioxygen and argon saturated solutions was used to determine the dependence of the rate on the dioxygen concentration. For the determination of the pH in this mixed solvent, the glass electrode was calibrated by standard aqueous buffer solutions at pH = 4.0, 7.0, and 10. The actual pH was calculated by subtracting 0.21 units from the pH-meter reading according to the Bates method. 39 A p K w value of 14.84 was used for the auto-ionization constants of water in 50% (m/m) ethanol–water. 40 The auto-oxidation of 3,5-di- tert -butylcatechol was also determined for each substrate concentration and the pH value was subtracted from the overall effect in order to obtain the extent of oxidation solely catalyzed by copper( II )–tachpyz complexes. Kinetic studies were carried out by the method of initial rates (if the reaction was sufficiently fast, the data between 2–5% conversion was used), but in some cases the integral method (up to 90% conversion) was used. The reported data are averages of the three parallel experiments. The maximum deviation from the main value did not exceed 10%.

From cou.: 23 The 2-electron oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol (H2dtbc, Scheme 2) in the presence and absence of the copper(II)–tachpyz system was monitored spectrophotometrically on a Unicam Helios α spectrophotometer by following the increase of the 3,5-di-tert-butyl-o-benzoquinone (dtbq) absorption band at 406 nm (ε = 1900 M−1 cm−1).

From Soup: 23 Given the sensitivity of the electronic structure of copper( II ) complexes with respect to the composition of density functionals and the quality of the basis set employed, 41 we evaluated the electronic structure of the copper( II )–tachpyz system using a range of hybrid GGA functionals. These included pure DFT functionals of BP86, 42 the commonly used B3LYP 43 hybrid functionals, and systematically varied composition with 18%, 38%, 75%, 100% HFX and Becke88 exchange 42a with Perdew86 correlation 42b functionals. The hybrid functional B(38HF)P86 was already shown to be spectroscopically calibrated for a series of copper( II ) containing bioinorganic complexes and metalloprotein active sites. 44 A hybrid functional with 18% HF exchange was chosen to evaluate the effect of correlation functionals between B(18HF)P86 and B3LYP functionals. The basis set employed (def2TZVP 45 ) is larger than needed for the saturation limit as defined earlier. 44,46

From Soup: 24 The desired spin coupling scheme among the three copper( II ) sites in the [Cu 3 H −4 L 2 ] 2+ complex was achieved by using the generalized ionic fragment approach (GIFA 47 ). First, the well-defined electronic structures of the copper( II ) ion and the deprotonated tachpyz ligand were generated at the HF level. The relaxed electronic structures of these fragments were merged into an initial guess of the molecular orbital for the [Cu 3 H −4 L 2 ] complex, as an ionic limit for the electronic structure without covalent interactions. This was sequentially relaxed in a more and more covalent calculation as the amount of HF exchange was decreased from 100% to 0% and in parallel the DF exchange was increased from 0% to 100% at the pure GGA level.

From Soup: 25 The brown complex 1 was crystallized by slow evaporation from water containing copper( II ) and tachpyz in a 1.4/1 ratio at pH 8.0 held at room temperature for about 1 week. A representative set of bond lengths, interatomic distances, and bond angles of 1 are listed in Table 2 (the full list of data are collected in Table S2, see the ESI † ). Fig. 1 shows a PLUTO representation of 1 including a partial numbering scheme. The crystal structure confirms the existence of a unique trinuclear complex that features a tetra(pyrazolato) bridged linear tricopper( II ) arrangement. The peripheral Cu1–central Cu2 and central Cu2–peripheral Cu3 interatomic distances are 3.773 Å and 3.828 Å, respectively. The two peripheral copper( II ) ions have a slightly distorted square pyramidal geometry ( τ = 0.093 (Cu1) and 0.070 (Cu3)). 48 Their basal planes are formed by two secondary amino groups and two pyrazolato nitrogens. The copper( II )–nitrogen bond lengths fall in the range of 1.931–1.973 and 2.031–2.262 Å for the pyrazolato and secondary amino nitrogens, respectively. As expected, the Cu–N bond lengths of the apically bound third secondary amino nitrogens are more elongated (2.219(4) and 2.262(4) Å for Cu1 and Cu3 sites, respectively). The four deprotonated pyrazole rings bound to the peripheral copper( II ) ions create a tetrahedral environment for the central Cu2, resulting in the formation of four pyrazolate bridges. The average central Cu2–N distance is 1.967 Å. The tetrahedron around Cu2 is considerably flattened as the bond angles around the central Cu2 are between 95.7(2)° and 136.5(2)°, while the angle between the N21–Cu2–N31 and N71–Cu2–N81 chelate planes is ω = 61.2°. The distortion of the tetrahedral geometry towards a square planar is facilitated by the steric hindrance of the two bis-bidentate pyrazolate chelates, and the Jahn–Teller distortion force due to the 3d 9 electron configuration of copper( II ) ions. Search of the Cambridge Structural Database 49 (version 5.36 update May, 2015) revealed no similar trinuclear pyrazolate-bridged copper( II ) complex. Expanding the search for other metal ions only the tetra(pyrazolato) bridged trinuclear mixed-valent complex [Co III (L′)Co II (L′)Co III (Cl) 4 ] (where H 2 L′ = 1,3-bis(3-methyl-5-formylpyrazolylmethinimino)-propane-2-ol) has a similar structure, where the C3 carbons of the pyrazolato bridges are methyl-substituted, therefore the tetrahedron around the central cobalt( II ) is only slightly flattened ( ω = 84°). 50

From Soup: 28 The trinuclear copper( II ) complex can adapt multiple spin states due to various spin coupling schemes among the three 3d 9 copper( II ) sites. A conceptually correct electronic structure description can be determined for the ferromagnetically coupled (FC) S t = 3/2 state in the collinear spin approximation with each copper( II ) site having an m s = +1/2 spin state. Formally, the spin momentum can be flipped to be m s = −1/2 for one of the copper( II ) sites either at the central or one of the peripheral positions. This results in an antiferromagnetically coupled (AFC) S t = 1/2 state, which can be approximated by the broken-symmetry formalism within DFT. In the latter calculation, the result of the computation is a combination of all possible M s = 1/2 levels from the S t = 1/2 and the S t = 3/2 states. Using the expectation value of the spin operator for the S t = 3/2 state and the broken-symmetry M s = 1/2 state, the spin polarized S t = 1/2 energy levels can be estimated. 51

In both states the optimized structure shows a symmetric environment with respect to the two peripheral ends, which is different from what is seen in the crystal structure. This suggests that there are considerable crystal packing forces that can induce asymmetry between the two ends of the complex. Due to the high symmetry of the calculated structures, we do not differentiate between the two peripheral Cu sites in the computational results.

From Soup: 30 The calculated Cu spin densities, spin expectation values, and energy differences between the FC and AFC coupled structures are summarized in Table 3 . In all calculations independent of the composition of the hybrid functionals, we found the AFC state to be energetically lower relative to the FC state. The energy difference between the two spin states is greatly dependent on the nature of the density functional. At the most ionic level, the coupling between the sites is negligible since the energy gap between the FC and AFC states is 16 cm −1 . Inclusion of electron correlation in the form of Perdew's 1986 correlation functional increases the gap to 50 cm −1 . This increases to close to 2000 cm −1 for the pure GGA function, BP86. It is interesting to note that the B3LYP functional gives an energy gap about the same as the spectroscopically calibrated B38HFP86 functional despite the fact that it has about the same amount of DF exchange than the B18HFP86 functional. This emphasizes the influence of the nature of the correlation functional in addition to the mixing of HF and DF exchange functionals. The calculated energy gap between the FC and AFC states shown in Table 3 after spin projection can be used to estimate the J coupling value of −4(Δ E (FC − AFC)) between the two m s = ±1/2 sites. For the BS calculations of the AFC state, the central copper( II ) site with the tetrapyrazolato coordination environment (formally 2 negative charge) prefers to have the m s = −1/2 spin state, while the peripheral copper( II ) ions have m s = +1/2. As a function of DF exchange vs . HF exchange the energy gap increases from 11 cm −1 at HF to 767 cm −1 at the BP86 level. There was a peculiar switch in the preference of the spin coupling scheme at the B3LYP level where the central copper( II ) is preferred to have the m s = +1/2 state while the peripheral has m s = −1/2 with an unreasonably large energetic preference of 4469 cm −1 .

From Soup: 31 Despite the energetic differences between the FC and AFC states at the B38HFLYP/def2TZVP level there are negligible structural differences for the optimized structures, therefore Fig. 2 only shows the lowest energy AFC state in comparison with the B3LYP/def2TZVP structure. However, there are some notable differences between the B3LYP and B38HFLYP structures with the exception of the axial Cu–N interaction at the peripheral sites and the Cu⋯Cu vectors that are practically identical within a few hundreds of Ångströms. Furthermore, negligible differences can be seen in Fig. 2 among the angles between the two functionals. This is a stark warning against using only geometric information for evaluation of the electronic structure and/or accuracy of the level of theory.

From Soup: 32 The calculated peripheral and central Cu ion distances are in the range of 3.83–3.89 Å and 3.83–3.94 Å for the FC and AFC states, respectively as a function of the amount of HF exchange in the hybrid density functional. This is about 0.03–0.11 Å longer on average than the experimental value from the XRD structure (3.830 Å and 3.767 Å see above). ESI (Tables S6 and S7 † ) shows that the HF method gives the longest distance, as expected; however, by adding full DF correlation functional, the Cu⋯Cu distances become the shortest. Gradually adding more DF exchange functionals elongates this distance to practically the same distance at the pure GGA level as in the HF method. The long Cu⋯Cu distances correlate well with the small coupling constants between the paramagnetic sites (see above), which indicate that insertion of another atom between the two paramagnetic metal sites reduces the strength of the M⋯L⋯M super-exchange pathway and pushes the metals far enough to diminish the possibility for M⋯M direct exchange. The former tends to stabilize the antiferromagnetic state, while the dominance of the latter is responsible for the preference of the ferromagnetic state. The Cu–N distances around the central copper( II ) ions are in the range of 1.99–2.01 Å for the hybrid functionals and 2.07–2.08 Å at the HF level, which clearly highlights the drastic effect of correlation functional. The corresponding bond lengths for the peripheral Cu( II ) ions is about 0.1 Å longer with the same differences between DFT and HF calculations for the central copper( II ) ions. This is a reasonable agreement with the experimental Cu( II )–N distances of 1.904–1.973 and 2.014–2.247 Å for the pyrazolato and secondary amino nitrogens, although some of the distances are up to 0.05 Å and 0.12 Å longer than experimental values, respectively. The flattened tetrahedral coordination of the central Cu is again reasonably well reproduced with bond angles 94–100° and 137–141° relative to the experimental values of 95.68(15)° and 135.86(15)° at the B38HFP86/def2TZVP level.

From Soup: 33 The negligible structural differences among the computed structures shown in Fig. 2 are in contrast with the calculated atomic spin density distributions in Table 3 where there is about 0.1 e difference in the Cu atomic spin densities. As expected, the B3LYP results with less HF exchange are more covalent than the B38HFP86 functional. The large variation in the atomic spin densities between the HF method, the hybrid GGA, and pure GGA functional, while there are insignificant differences among the Cu–N and Cu⋯Cu distances and N–Cu–N angles, suggest that the covalent interactions do not play a dominant role in the overall chemical bonding and ionic interactions determine the overall structure and thus the complex stability. It is also interesting to note that the central Cu ion has a greater spin density than the peripherals in all calculations. This means that the tetrapyrazolato coordination in a flattened tetrahedral arrangement corresponds to a less covalent bonding than the peripheral copper( II ) ions involved with smaller spin density. This could be rationalized by the difference between the Cu ← N(amine) and Cu ← N(pyrazolato) charge transfer. The former transfers less electron density to the peripheral Cu ions, which in turn allow for the latter to dominate covalent Cu–N bonding. For the central Cu ion, the four strong donors compete to saturate the electrophilicity of the Cu ion, which results in an overall less covalent bonding and more N⋯N ligand/ligand repulsion. This electronic structural feature may prepare the central copper( II ) ion to be the site for catecholate substrate coordination as discussed below.

From Soup: 35 The interaction of copper( II ) with tachpyz was studied at Cu( II )/tachpyz ratios of 1/2, 1/1, 3/2 and 2/1. The combined evaluation of pH-potentiometric and UV-Vis spectrophotometric data indicated the formation of two mononuclear (CuH L , Cu L ) and three trinuclear (Cu 3 H −2 L 2 , Cu 3 H −3 L 2 and Cu 3 H −4 L 2 ) complexes in the copper( II )–tachpyz system. Their distribution curves are depicted in Fig. 3 . In equimolar Cu( II ): L solution, the highly stable Cu L complex is the dominant species between pH 4–7. Considering the protonation constants (log β 0 x 1 , x = 1, 2, 3) of the free ligand from Table 4 , the nearly complete formation of Cu L at pH 4 indicates that all the three secondary amines are coordinated. Nevertheless, log β 101 is more than five orders of magnitude greater than that of the related Cu(tach) complex ( Table 4 ), which suggests additional coordination of 2–3 pyrazole rings. The electronic and EPR spectra were used to the determine the coordination geometry around copper( II ) in Cu L . The two absorption bands observed on the visible/near IR spectrum of Cu L at 634 and 970 nm ( Fig. 4 and S5 in the ESI † ) clearly indicate a square pyramidal geometry around the metal ion with a relatively strong apical coordination, similarly to the copper( II ) complexes of several related tach derivatives. 25,52 This conclusion is also supported by the EPR parameters related to the species Cu L ( g o = 2.1141, A o = 64.6 G, g x / y / z = 2.040/2.060/2.225, A x / y / z = 20/15/170 G, Fig. 5 ). Consequently, the square pyramidal coordination environment created by three secondary amines and two pyrazole N(1) nitrogens in Cu L is similar to the peripheral copper( II ) ions in 1 .

From cou.: 36 The interaction of copper(II) with tachpyz was studied at Cu(II)/tachpyz ratios of 1/2, 1/1, 3/2 and 2/1. The combined evaluation of pH-potentiometric and UV-Vis spectrophotometric data indicated the formation of two mononuclear (CuHL, CuL) and three trinuclear (Cu3H−2L2, Cu3H−3L2 and Cu3H−4L2) complexes in the copper(II)–tachpyz system. Their distribution curves are depicted in Fig. 3. In equimolar Cu(II):L solution, the highly stable CuL complex is the dominant species between pH 4–7. Considering the protonation constants (logβ0x1, x = 1, 2, 3) of the free ligand from Table 4, the nearly complete formation of CuL at pH 4 indicates that all the three secondary amines are coordinated. Nevertheless, logβ101 is more than five orders of magnitude greater than that of the related Cu(tach) complex (Table 4), which suggests additional coordination of 2–3 pyrazole rings. The electronic and EPR spectra were used to the determine the coordination geometry around copper(II) in CuL. The two absorption bands observed on the visible/near IR spectrum of CuL at 634 and 970 nm (Fig. 4 and S5 in the ESI†) clearly indicate a square pyramidal geometry around the metal ion with a relatively strong apical coordination, similarly to the copper(II) complexes of several related tach derivatives.25,52 This conclusion is also supported by the EPR parameters related to the species CuL (go = 2.1141, Ao = 64.6 G, gx/y/z = 2.040/2.060/2.225, Ax/y/z = 20/15/170 G, Fig. 5). Consequently, the square pyramidal coordination environment created by three secondary amines and two pyrazole N(1) nitrogens in CuL is similar to the peripheral copper(II) ions in 1.
From Soup: 36 Above pH 7 the potentiometric data indicated further deprotonation and the formation of the trinuclear Cu 3 H −4 L 2 complex. Considering the structure of tachpyz, such processes should involve either copper( II ) promoted deprotonation of water molecules or pyrazole N(2)H protons. During the formation of Cu 3 H −4 L 2 the colour of the solution also changes from blue to reddish, due to the development of intense charge transfer (CT) bands between 400–600 nm ( Fig. 4 ). Such CT bands are consistent only with copper( II ) promoted deprotonation of pyrazole rings, i.e. the formation of a pyrazolate-bridged trinuclear core in Cu 3 H −4 L 2 . Accordingly, besides the identical composition and the protonation state, the structure of Cu 3 H −4 L 2 is also analogous to the crystallographically characterized complex 1 .

From Soup: 37 At room temperature, the formation of the trinuclear species causes a gradual decrease of the EPR signal intensity between pH 7–10 ( Fig. 5 ), due to the antiferromagnetic interaction between the copper( II ) centres, mediated by the bridging pyrazolate rings. However, at 77 K, a wide singlet ( g iso = 2.094, A iso = 25 G) appears in the EPR spectra (that overlaps with the spectrum of the residual Cu L species), which is in accordance with a coupled trinuclear core with a total spin of S = ½. This is also confirmed by the single-crystal EPR spectra of 1 measured at room temperature, which exhibit a broad quasi-anisotropic signal at g iso ∼ 2.1 (Fig. S6 in the ESI † ).

From Soup: 38 The complete transformation of Cu L into Cu 3 H −4 L 2 in equimolar Cu( II ): L solution is noteworthy, especially considering that its formation results in the liberation of a bound ligand 3Cu L = Cu 3 H −4 L 2 + L + 4H + , despite the high stability of Cu L . Therefore, the formation of the trinuclear complex is thermodynamically highly favoured above pH 7, and can be regarded as a pH-driven self-assembly. Since the coordination of copper( II ) ions to pyrazole N(1) nitrogens is a pre-requisite for the deprotonation of N(2)H protons at around the neutral pH range, the formation of the trinuclear complex is under the allosteric control of the two terminal copper( II ) ions.

From Soup: 39 The unique charge transfer bands observed between 400–600 nm, related to the pyrazolate-bridged trinuclear core, also appear at metal ion excess ([Cu 2+ ]/[tachpyz] = 3/2); however, their development is shifted to the lower pH range (pH 4–7, Fig. 4 ) as compared to the equimolar Cu( II ): L solutions. At copper( II ) excess, our pH-potentiometric data support the formation of three trinuclear species with different protonation states, i.e. containing different number of pyrazolate-bridges. The individual UV-Vis spectra of these species (Fig. S7 in ESI † ) show continuous intensity increase and blue shift of the CT bands with increasing number of pyrazolate bridges. The complex Cu 3 H −2 L 2 is always a minor compound between pH 4–6 ( Fig. 3 ), the formation of Cu 3 H −3 L 2 is more pronounced and shows a maximum around pH 5.5, while the already mentioned Cu 3 H −4 L 2 , the aqueous equivalent of the crystallographically characterized complex 1 , becomes the unique species above pH 7. Accordingly, the copper( II ) promoted deprotonation of the neutral pyrazole units, i.e. the formation of pyrazolate-bridged complexes, starts around pH 4 at a 3/2 metal-to-ligand ratio. This is in good agreement with some other pyrazolato-bridged copper( II ) complexes. 29

From Soup: 40 Since dioxygen activation at ambient conditions has been an attractive research goal, a large number of reports on biomimetic models of catechol oxidase have appeared in the literature. 28,53 3,5-Di- tert -butylcatechol (H 2 dtbc, Scheme 2 ) is a widely used substrate to study catechol oxidase activity of copper( II ) complexes, 54–64 since the bulky substituents hinder further oxidation of the product 3,5-di- tert -butyl-1,2-benzoquinone (dtbq).

A difference was found only in the formation of trinuclear complexes being shifted to the lower pH range (see insert in Fig. 6 ), according to the lower polarity of the solvent.

From Soup: 42 In the case of catecholase models, the electrochemistry of the complexes has a crucial role, since their reduction potentials should permit the oxidation of catechol derivatives and the subsequent re-oxidation of the reduced copper centers by molecular oxygen to maintain the catalytic cycle.

The relatively well developed reduction peak at E pc = 0.26 V ( vs .

From Soup: 43 The profile of the rate constant of H 2 dtbc oxidation versus pH at a 1.4/1 Cu( II )/tachpyz ratio is a distorted bell-shaped curve ( Fig. 7 ) with a surprisingly low pH optimum around pH 5.6. This observation suggests the formation of the reactive species between pH 4 and 5.6, then its subsequent transformation into an inactive one at higher pH. This pH rate constant profile is not directly comparable with the speciation of the binary complexes, since the oxidation of H 2 dtbc promoted by the copper( II ) complexes requires the formation of a complex–dtbc ternary adduct. The formation of this adduct is obviously a pH-dependent process, therefore the presence of a strong metal ion binder H 2 dtbc may substantially alter the complex formation processes.

From Soup: 44 In order to obtain some information about the above mentioned ternary species, and on the binding mode of the substrate H 2 dtbc, we studied the interaction of 4-nitrocatechol (H 2 4NC) with the trinuclear complexes. The oxidation of this electron-poor catechol derivative is hindered, and it is a useful chromophoric probe to mimic catechol–metal ion interaction. 67–69 In a 50% (m/m) ethanol–water mixture containing H 2 4NC : tachpyz : Cu( II ) in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 3, an absorption peak at λ max = 446 nm develops above pH ∼ 4 ( Fig. 8 ), nearly in parallel with the observed catalytic activity for H 2 dtbc oxidation (see the insert in Fig. 8 ). The intensity of this band levels off around the pH of the maximum catalytic activity (pH = 5.6). Since the p K 1 of 4-nitrocatechol under these conditions is 7.1 ± 0.1 (this study), at pH 5.6 only a small percentage of non-coordinated 4-nitrocatechols are deprotonated. Consequently, the band at 446 nm is related to the copper( II )-bound 4-nitrocatechol, since the interaction of H 2 4NC with the copper( II ) complexes results in its deprotonation at considerably lower pH (pK ∼ 4.6). The binding mode of 4-nitrocatecholate dianion to the trinuclear complexes is not clear. Although, the bidentate η 2 or bridging η 2 :η 1 coordination mode to copper( II ) complexes exhibits a similar CT band at λ max = 440–470 nm, 68,69 the ca. 3.8 Å distance between the central and terminal copper( II ) ions would allow η 1 :η 1 bridging coordination of catechol derivatives, too. 70,71

From Soup: 45 The appearance of a plateau around pH 5.6 in the absorbance versus pH profile ( Fig. 8 ) indicates that the formation of the ternary complex(es) reached a maximum. The increase of absorbance at 446 nm above pH 6 is due to the deprotonation of the unbound 4-nitrocatechol ( λ max of H4NC − is at 432 nm ( ref. 67 )). In parallel with this process, the oxidation of H 2 dtbc promoted by the trinuclear copper( II ) complexes diminishes (insert in Fig. 8 ). These observations suggest that the formation of the highly stable Cu 3 H −4 L 2 species, having a compact coordination sphere around the metal ions, hinders the coordination possibility of the catechol derivatives, which renders the complex unable to promote the oxidation of H 2 dtbc.

From Soup: 46 Since the kinetically active species has a trinuclear core, in principle, more than one catechol derivative may be coordinated to the metal ions. Therefore, we followed the changes on the UV-Vis spectra at pH 5.7 with increasing concentration of H 2 4NC ( Fig. 9 ). The absorbances at 446 nm as a function of the [H 2 4NC]/([Cu( II )]/3]) ratio (insert in Fig. 9 ) show a breakpoint around one equivalent of 4-nitrocatechol. The experimental data can be well reproduced by assuming the formation of a single ternary species with a 1 : 1 ratio of 4-nitrocatechol and the trinuclear complexes. The calculated apparent association constant for this adduct [(Cu 3 H − y L 2 )(4NC)], where y = 2 and 3, is K app = (4.9 ± 0.2) × 10 4 (see the solid line in the insert of Fig. 9 ), which confirms the high coordinating ability of catechol derivatives to the less deprotonated trinuclear core. Under our conditions and at [H 2 4NC]/([Cu( II )]/3]) = 1, ca . 54% of 4-nitrocatechol is bound. This is in good agreement with the plateau observed between pH 5.3 and 6 in Fig. 8 . The increasing absorbance at 446 nm after adding one equivalent of 4-nitrocatechol is related to the completion of adduct formation and to the absorbance of the free 4-nitrocatechol itself. These observations suggest only one strongly bound (4-nitro)catechol to the trinuclear complexes. Fragmentation of the trinuclear complex upon catecholate binding could also be considered, but the loss of catechol oxidase activity above pH 6 suggests that the trinuclear complex remains intact.

From Soup: 49 Under anaerobic conditions a stoichiometric redox reaction was observed between the substrate and the trinuclear complexes (Fig. S9 † ), leading to the formation of dtbq and copper( I ). The formation of hydrogen peroxide during the catalytic process was monitored using the reaction with iodide and TiOSO 4 , after the extraction of dtbq by CH 2 Cl 2 , but only negligible amount of H 2 O 2 was detected, and its accumulation was not observed. On the other hand, the presence of added H 2 O 2 has clearly affected the reaction rate of the catalytic process.

From Soup: 50 The above kinetic data can be interpreted by a mechanism similar to that proposed by Casella et al. ( Scheme 2 ). 73 Complex Cu 3 H −4 L 2 , the solution equivalent of the crystallographically characterized complex 1 , which is the dominant species at neutral pH, is inactive. Since the doubly deprotonated Cu 3 H −2 L 2 is only a minor species in aqueous solution, we suggest that the observed catalytic activity is mainly related to the triply deprotonated Cu 3 H −3 L 2 . It forms a stable ternary complex with H 2 dtbc in a fast pre-equilibrium, and a two-electron transfer process results in the formation of dtbq and copper( I ) centres. Upon product dissociation, the copper( I ) centres are re-oxidized by dioxygen. Since the accumulation of H 2 O 2 was not observed during the catalytic process, according to several earlier proposals, 53 we suggest the formation of a peroxo-bound trinuclear complex, which in turn reacts with a further H 2 dtbc to recover the original triply deprotonated trinuclear species ( Scheme 2 ). In an alternative reaction path, the reduced complex can also be re-oxidized by hydrogen peroxide.

Since the doubly deprotonated Cu3H−2L2 is only a minor species in aqueous solution, we suggest that the observed catalytic activity is mainly related to the triply deprotonated Cu3H−3L2. It forms a stable ternary complex with H2dtbc in a fast pre-equilibrium, and a two-electron transfer process results in the formation of dtbq and copper(I) centres. Upon product dissociation, the copper(I) centres are re-oxidized by dioxygen. Since the accumulation of H2O2 was not observed during the catalytic process, according to several earlier proposals,53 we suggest the formation of a peroxo-bound trinuclear complex, which in turn reacts with a further H2dtbc to recover the original triply deprotonated trinuclear species (Scheme 2). In an alternative reaction path, the reduced complex can also be re-oxidized by hydrogen peroxide.
From Soup: 51 Since the fully deprotonated Cu 3 H −4 L 2 and the mononuclear Cu L , which has a similar coordination environment to the peripheral copper( II ) ions in 1 , have not been able to promote the oxidation of H 2 dtbc, we assume that the central copper( II ) ion, with an unsaturated and unusual pyrazolate-bound coordination sphere, has a fundamental role in binding and oxidation of catechols. At higher pH, where the four pyrazolato rings are bound to the central copper, the reaction is inhibited, since the substrate is no longer able to coordinate to the trinuclear core.

From Soup: 52 A new polydentate tripodal ligand with pyrazole-containing legs ( L × 3HCl) has been prepared on the basis of cis , cis -1,3,5-triaminocyclohexane, and its interaction with copper( II ) was studied. Mononuclear (CuH L , Cu L ) and three trinuclear (Cu 3 H − x L 2 , x = 2, 3, 4) complexes were identified in solution by combined evaluation of potentiometric, UV-VIS, and EPR data. The mononuclear Cu L complex is highly stable, nevertheless it transforms into trinuclear complexes even in an equimolar Cu( II ): L solution. In parallel with the development of trinuclear complexes, intense charge transfer bands appear around 400–500 nm, indicating the formation of pyrazolate-bridged complexes. The crystal structure of [Cu 3 H −4 L 2 ](ClO 4 ) 2 ·5H 2 O ( 1 ) reveals the formation of a unique trinuclear complex that features a tetra(pyrazolate)-bridged linear tricopper( II ) core. The two peripheral copper( II ) ions have a slightly distorted square pyramidal geometry. The four pyrazole rings bound to the two peripheral copper( II ) ions are deprotonated and create a Jahn–Teller distorted flattened tetrahedral environment for the central copper( II ). Hybrid DFT calculations provided additional details about the geometric and electronic structures of the trinuclear complex showing a preference for the antiferromagnetically coupled ground state with the S t = 1/2 ground state. The triply deprotonated trinuclear complex is an efficient catechol oxidase mimic, which shows a surprisingly low pH optimum around pH = 5.6. Since the mononuclear Cu L species is not able to promote the oxidation of 3,5-di- tert -butylcatechol, we assume that the central copper( II ) ion with an unsaturated coordination sphere has a fundamental role in binding and oxidation of the substrate.
