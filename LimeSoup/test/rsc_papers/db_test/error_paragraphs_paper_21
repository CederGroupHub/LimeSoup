From Soup: 0 Buxing Han was born in 1957. He completed a BS in chemical engineering in 1982 (Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang), an MS in inorganic chemistry in 1985 (Applied Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun) and a PhD in physical chemistry from the Institute of Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing in 1988. After a year as an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Chemistry, he took up a post-doctoral position in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada. He returned to the Institute of Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1991 and was promoted to Associate Professor in the same year. He has been a full Professor since 1993.
