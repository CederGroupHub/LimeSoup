From Soup: 0 Two new high-nuclearity mixed-valence Mn clusters, Mn19 and Mn21, were synthesised utilising an alkylamine-based flexible ligand with five alkoxo-bridging groups, 1,3-bis-diethanolamino-2-propanol (H5bdp). They were obtained from the reaction of Mn(O2CPh)2·2H2O with H5bdp·2HCl·H2O and Et3N in a 4 : 1 : 7 molar ratio in CH3CN/CH3OH mixed solution. The X-ray crystal structures revealed {MnII8MnIII10MnIV} and {MnII6MnIII15} mixed-valence cores composed around {Mn7O8} corner-shared double cubanes. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on both complexes indicated dominant intramolecular antiferromagnetic interactions between Mn ions. No clear SMM behaviour was observed above 1.8 K due to the non-parallel alignment of magnetic anisotropy axes of the MnIII ions.

From Soup: 1 Polynuclear transition metal complexes attract substantial attention due to their physical properties arising from the synergistic effects between metal ions. 1 Such complexes are nano-sized materials, commonly synthesised through a combination of informed molecular design and serendipitous self-assembly, and exhibit significantly different physico-chemical properties from bulk materials or nanoparticles. Furthermore, control of their structural topology and the oxidation states of their constituent metal ions can be attained by chemical modification of the supporting organic ligands.

From Soup: 2 In the study of transition metal complexes, nuclearity is one of the most important metrics, as it can directly influence the magnetic and electronic properties of the cluster. 2 Similarly important is the manner in which metal centres are connected, as the properties of the cluster depend upon the degree to which the electronic or magnetic states of neighbouring metal centres are correlated. 3 Small ionic ligands can mediate strong electronic or magnetic cooperativity between metal centres. For example, cyanide bridges can allow stimuli-responsive electron transfers in heterometal systems, 4 and oxo bridges can mediate spin dependent electron delocalization in manganese clusters. 5 While the directional nature of linear or 1D bridging ligands such as cyanide, azide and pyrazole allows their use in a controlled, or building block-type approach to the synthesis of high nuclearity clusters, the monoatomic nature of the oxo dianion ensures that the targeted generation of oxo-bridged clusters remains a challenging goal.

From Soup: 3 With the exception of polyoxometalates 6 (POMs; discrete anionic metal–oxide species based on high valent V, Mo and W), which have been reported with nuclearities up to [Mo368], 7 the synthesis of molecular metal oxide species is hampered by the harsh conditions required in such reactions, which can often yield bulk metal oxide and/or amorphous metal hydroxide. For this reason, the chemistry of transition metal oxide clusters is relatively under-developed, although in recent years there have been an increasing number of publications on their syntheses. 8

From Soup: 16 In both 1 and 2, the Mn oxide core is based around a corner-sharing double cubane, which consists of seven Mn atoms, six μ4-oxo and two μ3-oxo groups ( Fig. 3 ). It is interesting to note that while cubane and double-cubane units are common structural motifs in manganese cluster chemistry, the previous examples of 19- and 21-nuclear Mn clusters have generally been based on open or defective cubane-type topologies. 8a In 1, the central octahedral Mn1 atom of the double cubane is MnIV and is coordinated by six bridging oxo ions with an average bond distance of 1.915(4) Å. The remaining Mn ions that constitute the double cubane (Mn2, Mn3 and Mn4) are trivalent and exhibit Jahn–Teller distorted octahedral coordination environments with axial (Mn–Oax) and equatorial (Mn–Oeq) Mn–O bond distances in the range of 2.114(4)–2.326(4) Å and 1.901(4)–1.985(4) Å, respectively. In contrast, all Mn atoms in the double cubane at the core of complex 2 (Mn1–Mn4B) are trivalent and exhibit Jahn–Teller distorted octahedral coordination environments with Mn–Oax and Mn–Oeq bond distances in the range of 2.116(5)–2.440(5) Å and 1.853(4)–2.053(5) Å, respectively. The double cubanes of both 1 and 2 are capped by MnIII/MnII mixed-valence shells through a combination of inorganic oxo and hydroxo ions, the alkoxo groups of the capping ligands and the carboxylate moieties of the benzoate ions. In addition to these ligands, the two H4bdp* ligands formed during the reaction period act as a bridge between the double cubane core and the mixed-valence shell in complex 2.

From Soup: 19 Temperature dependent dc magnetic susceptibilities were measured for 1·4H2O and 2·7H2O in the temperature range of 1.8–300 K, and the results are plotted in Fig. 4 . At 300 K, the χT value of 1·4H2O is 49.7 emu K mol−1, which is much smaller than the spin only value of 66.9 emu K mol−1 expected for the uncorrelated spins of eight MnII, ten MnIII and one MnIV ion. As the temperature is lowered, the χT value decreases gradually at first, and then rapidly to reach a minimum value of 1.53 emu K mol−1 at 1.8 K, indicating dominant antiferromagnetic interactions are operative between the metal centres. For 2·7H2O, the χT value is 38.8 emu K mol−1 at 300 K, which is much smaller than the spin only value of 71.3 emu K mol−1 expected for the uncorrelated spins of six MnII and fifteen MnIII ions. The χT value decreases with decreasing temperature, reaching a plateau at about 20 K with a value of ∼11.6 emu K mol−1 (corresponding to a S = 10/2 or 8/2 ground spin state, depend on the g value). On further cooling below 5 K, the χT value again decreases to a minimum value of 10.5 emu K mol−1 due to zero-field splitting and/or weak intermolecular antiferromagnetic interactions (the shortest intermolecular Mn⋯Mn distance is ∼8.1 Å). Although both complexes have Mn–oxide cores based around a similar corner-shared double cubane, {Mn7O8}, the magnetic behaviour of the two complexes is different, suggesting that different magnetic interactions are operative between Mn ions. Such magnetic pathways are very sensitive to bridging bond angles and electronic configuration. Furthermore, the relative positions of the Jahn–Teller axes of the MnIII ions are a key factor in the determination of the magnetic interaction pathways. 19 As shown in Fig. 3 , the distortion of the double cubane and the relative alignments of the Jahn–Teller axes of the MnIII ions are significantly altered by the inclusion of the MnIV ion in 1 in place of the MnIII ion in 2. Hence, there is a substantial difference in the magnetic interactions in 1 and 2. The magnetization curves of both complexes, neither of which reach saturation up to 5 T, are shown in Fig. S3. † Low temperature ac magnetic measurements indicate no clear SMM behaviour above 1.8 K for either 1·4H2O or 2·7H2O (Fig. S4 and S5 † ), possibly due to the small molecular magnetic anisotropy, D, resulting from the non-parallel alignment of the Jahn–Teller axes of the MnIII ions.

From cou.: 20 Temperature dependent dc magnetic susceptibilities were measured for 1·4H2O and 2·7H2O in the temperature range of 1.8–300 K, and the results are plotted in Fig. 4. At 300 K, the χT value of 1·4H2O is 49.7 emu K mol−1, which is much smaller than the spin only value of 66.9 emu K mol−1 expected for the uncorrelated spins of eight MnII, ten MnIII and one MnIV ion. As the temperature is lowered, the χT value decreases gradually at first, and then rapidly to reach a minimum value of 1.53 emu K mol−1 at 1.8 K, indicating dominant antiferromagnetic interactions are operative between the metal centres. For 2·7H2O, the χT value is 38.8 emu K mol−1 at 300 K, which is much smaller than the spin only value of 71.3 emu K mol−1 expected for the uncorrelated spins of six MnII and fifteen MnIII ions. The χT value decreases with decreasing temperature, reaching a plateau at about 20 K with a value of ∼11.6 emu K mol−1 (corresponding to a S = 10/2 or 8/2 ground spin state, depend on the g value). On further cooling below 5 K, the χT value again decreases to a minimum value of 10.5 emu K mol−1 due to zero-field splitting and/or weak intermolecular antiferromagnetic interactions (the shortest intermolecular Mn⋯Mn distance is ∼8.1 Å). Although both complexes have Mn–oxide cores based around a similar corner-shared double cubane, {Mn7O8}, the magnetic behaviour of the two complexes is different, suggesting that different magnetic interactions are operative between Mn ions. Such magnetic pathways are very sensitive to bridging bond angles and electronic configuration. Furthermore, the relative positions of the Jahn–Teller axes of the MnIII ions are a key factor in the determination of the magnetic interaction pathways.19 As shown in Fig. 3, the distortion of the double cubane and the relative alignments of the Jahn–Teller axes of the MnIII ions are significantly altered by the inclusion of the MnIV ion in 1 in place of the MnIII ion in 2.

From Soup: 20 High nuclearity mixed-valence Mn oxide clusters, [MnII8MnIII10MnIVO10(OH)4(Hbdp)2(O2CPh)18] (1) and [MnII6MnIII15O12(OH)4(bdp)2(Hbdp*)(H2bdp*)(O2CPh)14] (2) were synthesised utilizing alkylamine based multidentate ligands with multiple alkoxo bridging groups. The cores of both complexes were constructed similar corner-shared double cubanes {Mn7O8} with the only difference in the oxidation state of the central Mn ions. 1 and 2 show dominant antiferromagnetic interactions between Mn ions and no SMM behaviour was observed above 1.8 K due to the non-parallel alignment of MnIII magnetic anisotropy axes.
