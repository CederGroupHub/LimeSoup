From Soup: 0 The research field of crystal engineering has grown over recent years and now lies at the forefront of many areas of chemistry, pharmaceutical and materials science. The fundamental importance of understanding and trying to control to growth of crystalline materials underpins so many research directions that a wider appreciation of the complexity of the field has emerged amongst scientists. It is perhaps unsurprising therefore that such an important field as crystal engineering regularly greets new and emerging scientists.

From Soup: 1 This themed issue of CrystEngComm, dedicated to emerging talent in the field, demonstrates the diversity of crystal engineering and how it lies at the heart of so much research endeavour. With contributions from across the world the studies contained herein make contributions to the fundamental understanding of nucleation processes, theoretical understanding of intermolecular interactions and crystal structure prediction. The issue also highlights many of the most topical themes of crystal engineering including the development of new materials including one of the most ubiquitous areas of chemical study, metal–organic frameworks or MOFs.
