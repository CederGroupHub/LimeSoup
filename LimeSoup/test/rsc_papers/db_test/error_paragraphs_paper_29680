From cou.: 1 The fragments of rat amylin rIAPP(17–29) (Ac-VRSSNNLGPVLPP-NH2), rIAPP(17–22) (Ac-VRSSNN-NH2), rIAPP(19–22) (Ac-SSNN-NH2) and rIAPP(17–20) (Ac-VRSS-NH2) together with the related mutant peptides (Ac-VASS-NH2 and Ac-VRAA-NH2) have been synthesized and their copper(II) complexes studied by potentiometric, UV-Vis, CD and EPR spectroscopic methods. Despite the lack of any common strongly coordinating donor functions some of these fragments are able to bind copper(II) ions in the physiological pH range. The longest fragment rat amylin(17–29) keeps one equivalent copper(II) ion in solution in the whole pH range, while two other peptides Ac-VRSSNN-NH2 and Ac-SSNN-NH2 are also able to interact with copper(II) ions in the slightly alkaline pH range. According to the spectral parameters of the complexes, the peptides can be classified into two different categories: (i) the tetrapeptides Ac-VRSS-NH2, Ac-VASS-NH2 and Ac-VRAA-NH2 can interact with copper(II) only under strongly alkaline conditions (pH > 10.0) and the formation of only one species with four amide nitrogen coordination can be detected; (ii) the peptides Ac-VRSSNNLGPVLPP-NH2, Ac-VRSSNN-NH2 and Ac-SSNN-NH2 can form complexes above pH 6.0 with the major stoichiometries [CuH−2L], [CuH−3L]− and [CuH−4L]2−. These data support that rIAPP(17–29) can interact with copper(II) ions under physiological conditions and the SSNN tetrapeptide fragment can be considered as the shortest sequence responsible for metal binding. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide some information on the possible coordination modes of Ac-SSNN-NH2 towards the copper(II) ion and suggest that for [CuH−2L], [CuH−3L]− and [CuH−4L]2−, the binding of two, three and four deprotonated amide nitrogens, with NH− of the side chain of asparagine as anchoring group, is probable. Moreover, these data reveal that peptides can be effective metal binding ligands even in the absence of anchoring groups, if more polar side chains are present in a specific sequence.

From cou.: 2 Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is a peptide hormone consisting of 37 amino acid residues which is co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic islet β-cells.1–3 Although the physiological role of hIAPP is still not well established, several functions have been associated with the soluble form of hIAPP including the control of hyperglycemia by regulating glucose homeostasis.4 The formation of hIAPP aggregates is strongly associated with β-cell degeneration in type 2 diabetes, because more than 95% of patients exhibit hIAPP amyloid upon autopsy.5–7 Besides humans, only a few species of animals are known to develop islet amyloid, these include non-human primates,8 cats9 and raccoons.9 Rat amylin (rIAPP) does not show tendency for self-aggregation and is not toxic to islet cells. Rat amylin is highly homologous to human amylin, but differs in six amino acids (Table 1) resulting in a non-amyloidogenic peptide.10–13

From cou.: 3 It has been reported that species-specific amino acid differences in the 20–29 region of IAPP may be important in determining these differences in amyloidogenicity. Single substitutions at several positions in human IAPP(20–29) (with amino acid residues of rodents) negatively influenced amyloid fibril formation. However, exchanging the serine residue at position 28 for proline most dramatically inhibited the aggregation of the peptide into fibrils.10

From cou.: 4 hIAPP amyloid formation follows the nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism and proceeds via a conformational transition of soluble hIAPP into aggregated β-sheets. It has been reported that the penta- and hexapeptide sequences, hIAPP(23–27) (FGAIL) and hIAPP(22–27) (NFGAIL) are sufficient for the formation of β-sheet-containing amyloid fibrils. Although these two peptides differ by only one amino acid residue, they aggregate into completely different fibrillar assemblies. hIAPP(23–27) (FGAIL) fibrils self-assemble laterally into unusually broad ribbons, whereas hIAPP(22–27) (NFGAIL) fibrils coil around each other in a typical amyloid fibril morphology. hIAPP(20–27) (SNNFGAIL) also aggregates into β-sheet-containing fibrils, whereas no amyloidogenicity is found for hIAPP(24–27) (GAIL), indicating that hIAPP(23–27) (FGAIL) is the shortest fibrillogenic sequence of hIAPP.14

From cou.: 5 Other studies carried out on the peptide fragments hIAPP(17-29) and rIAPP(17-29), encompassing the 17–29 sequences of human and rat IAPP respectively, demonstrated that these peptides are useful models to recapitulate most of the structural features of full length hIAPP.15 In particular, in analogy to the whole hIAPP, the protonation state of the His18 is responsible for the pH dependence of the aggregation process as well as for the aggregation rate.16 Conversely, the rIAPP(17–29) peptide model does not reveal any propensity towards self-aggregation at physiological pH values being only capable, in alkaline conditions, to form small rod-like structures without, however, evolving to micrometric sized fibrillar structures as observed for the human counterpart.17 The formation of peptide or protein aggregates is a common feature of many different forms of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and prion diseases. It has also been widely accepted that various metal ions can play a significant role in the conformational changes of these peptides/proteins. As a consequence, a huge number of papers have already been published on the metal complexes of the peptide fragments of prion protein and amyloid-β. The major findings of these studies have already been reviewed18–22 and histidyl residues were considered as the primary metal binding sites with the involvement of subsequent amide functions in copper(II) coordination. Our previous studies on the peptide fragments of prion protein23,24 revealed the high selectivity of these peptides for copper(II) binding, while amyloid-β25,26 was found to form very stable complexes both with copper(II) and zinc(II) ions. On the contrary, literature data are not available for the complex formation processes with fragments of human and rat amylin. The presence of H18 residue in hIAPP(17–29) strongly supports its outstanding metal binding capacity, but rIAPP(17–29) does not contain any side chain residues, which were considered as anchors for metal binding.27 All the amino acids in the sequence 18–22 (RSSNN), however, contain polar side chains, which may contribute to the metal binding ability of peptide molecules. The specific sequence of rIAPP justifies studies on the complex formation reactions with various fragments of human and rat amylin.

From cou.: 6 In this paper, we report the synthesis and studies of the copper complexes of rIAPP fragments. First of all the terminally protected tridecapeptide rIAPP(17–29) was investigated in which the potentially metal binding amino acid residues are located in the N-terminus. The surprisingly high affinity of this peptide towards complexation with copper(II) promoted a systematic study on the shorter fragments including rIAPP(17–22) (Ac-VRSSNN-NH2), rIAPP(17–20) (Ac-VRSS-NH2), its mutant peptides (Ac-VASS-NH2 and Ac-VRAA-NH2) and rIAPP(19–22) (Ac-SSNN-NH2).

From cou.: 8 The amino acid sequences of all peptides investigated plus the human and rat amylin (hIAPP and rIAPP) are reported in Table 1. Solid phase peptide synthesis was performed using a microwave-assisted Liberty Peptide Synthesizer (CEM, Matthews, NC), introducing the amino acid derivatives following the TBTU/HOBt/DIEA activation strategy on NovaSyn TGR resin. Removal of the Fmoc was carried out at 75 °C with 25 Watts microwave power for 180 s by means of 20% piperidine in DMF. Coupling was achieved at 75 °C with 25 Watts microwave power, for 300 s, using 4 times excess of amino acids, 0.5 M HOBt/0.5 M TBTU in DMF and 2 M DIPEA in NMP. Finally, N-terminal acetylation was performed by treating the fully assembled and protected peptide resins (after removal of the N-terminal Fmoc group) with a solution containing acetic anhydride (6% v/v) and DIEA (5% v/v) in DMF. Peptides were cleaved from their respective resins, with the simultaneous removal of the side chain protective groups, by treatment with a mixture of TFA/TIS/H2O (95/2.5/2.5 v/v) for 2 h at room temperature. Each solution containing the free peptide was separated from the resin by filtration and concentrated in vacuum at 30 °C. The crude peptides were recovered from the pertinent solution by precipitation with cold, freshly distilled diethyl ether. The precipitate was filtered, dried under vacuum, re-dissolved in water, and lyophilized. The crude peptides were purified by preparative reverse phase liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a Varian PrepStar 200 model SD-1 chromatography system equipped with a Prostar photodiode array detector, monitoring the absorbance at 222 nm. Chromatographic separation was obtained on a Preparative Varian Dynamax C18 (300 Å pore size, 10 μm particle size) 250 × 41.4 mm column by applying a linear gradient of solvent A (0.1% TFA in CH3CN) to B (0.1% TFA in water) at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1. The elution gradient was optimized for each peptide. The identity of the peptides was confirmed by ESI-MS experiments on a Finnigan LCQ-Duo ion trap electrospray mass spectrometer.

From cou.: 17 As the studied amylin fragments are protected at both termini and do not contain any dissociable proton in the measurable pH range, their concentration cannot be checked by pH potentiometry. Therefore the concentration of the samples and the metal to ligand ratio were determined spectrophotometrically. This is based upon the formation of an adduct of α-naphthol with arginine in the presence of butane-2,3-dione, which has an absorption maximum at 530 nm.

From cou.: 24 The Convex Constraint Algorithm (CCA+) program33,34 deconvolutes a set of data (typically a set of CD spectra) stored in the “A[M × N] matrix”. The procedure results in a given number of “pure” (or component) spectra (stored in the “B[M × S]” matrix) and simultaneously creates the adjacent coefficient matrix (called “C[S × N]” matrix), which determines the contribution of a “pure” spectrum (stored in B[M × N]) to a spectrum stored in the A[M × N] matrix. In other words, this is the “inverse” procedure of a linear combination, where on the basis of the B(M × S) and C(S × N) matrices one calculates the A(M × N) matrix.

From Soup: 50 The ORCA program was used to calculate the g and A tensors of the 63 Cu centre for each complex. The method for calculation of g and A was developed and implemented into the ORCA package by Neese. 45,46 The A tensor is calculated as a sum of three terms: the isotropic Fermi contact ( A FC ), the spin-dipolar ( A D x,y,z ) and the spin–orbit coupling term ( A SO x,y,z ). To produce a good estimation for the Fermi contact, calculations need to include appropriate spin polarization which can be achieved through the use of the UKS formalism; moreover, the spin–orbit contribution to A , not calculated by Gaussian 03, was found to become more and more important for late 3d elements, like Co , 47 Ni , 48 and mainly Cu , 46,47 and its inclusion in the calculations seems essential to reach a good agreement with the experimental data .

From Soup: 51 The complex formation of the ligands with copper( II ) ion was investigated by pH-potentiometric titration , UV-Vis spectrophotometry , CD and EPR spectroscopy . Before the interpretation of the results, it is important to note that stable complex formation with peptide molecules generally requires the presence of an anchoring donor group in the molecule. The terminal amino group or the side chain thiol and/or imidazole functions of cysteinyl and/or histidyl residues are generally considered as the most common anchors for copper( II ) coordination. None of these functional groups are present in rIAPP, suggesting a significant difference in the complex formation processes of rIAPP fragments and the most common peptide molecules.

From Soup: 52 This fragment contains all the amino acids that may play a role in the metal binding of rIAPP; arginine , serine and asparagine . Although these amino acids are generally not considered as the primary metal binding sites, during the potentiometric titrations precipitation was not observed in the equimolar samples of copper( II ) and the peptide rIAPP(17–29). It is clear from the titration curve ( Fig. 1 ) that the ligand does not contain any dissociable proton , but in the presence of copper( II ) ions an extra base consuming process occurs above pH 5.5 supporting complex formation with the peptide amide functions or side chain residues. This process begins at a slightly higher pH range than in the case of common peptides containing an anchoring amino or imidazole nitrogen atom . The peptide rIAPP(17–29) is able to bind one equivalent of copper( II ) ion in the physiological pH range and the excess of copper( II ) ions results in the formation of copper( II ) hydroxide precipitate. The complex formation is accompanied by a colour change of the solution; the absorption maxima of the system are continuously shifted to the lower wavelength values by increasing pH ( Fig. 2 ), supporting the deprotonation and coordination of the amide nitrogens . The absorption maximum around pH 10.5 is 538 nm, which refers to the coordination of four amide nitrogens .

From Soup: 54 If we consider the pH range 7–10, the colour of the solution changes from blue to pink; although the changes in the EPR parameters are very small, a slight decrease of the hyperfine splitting constant and a decrease of the g z value can be observed. The superhyperfine coupling of the unpaired electron with 14 N nuclei in the first parallel band seems to indicate the coordination of two equivalent nitrogens around physiological pH. These two nitrogens cannot belong to backbone amides as these can be deprotonated only in the presence of an anchoring group , which apparently is not present in this peptide fragment.

From Soup: 55 The characterization of the system in terms of its solution equilibrium aspect is not an easy task. As the ligand is protected at both termini and does not contain any dissociable proton in the measurable pH range, its concentration cannot be determined by pH potentiometry .

Namely, the coordination of a protonated or deprotonated hydroxyl group of a serine residue can be supposed. A similar coordination mode was proved in the case aminosugars, where the formation of this binding mode is accompanied by the appearance of a characteristic charge transfer band in the near-UV region of the CD spectra . 51 This CD band can be seen around 320 nm in the pH range 6–8 in the copper( II )-rIAPP(17–29) system, which may originate from the hydroxyl binding of a serine residue to the Cu( II ) ion. However, there is no possibility for the formation of a stable chelate ring involving this side chain.

From Soup: 62 Stability constants are calculated only for these three complexes, but another species ([CuL] 2+ ) should exist before the formation of the [CuH −2 L] complex, which is able to keep the copper( II ) ion in solution. However, the formation of this complex is not accompanied by pH effect and its UV-Vis activity is too low to be revealed. This interaction may induce the deprotonation of amide nitrogens . The extent of this interaction is smaller in the case of the VRSSNN hexapeptide, therefore it hydrolyzes around pH 7, but the deprotonation of amide nitrogens occurs upon increasing the pH and the precipitate dissolves. The results obtained for the copper( II ) complexes of rIAPP(17–29) and Ac-VRSSNN-NH 2 suggest a high similarity in the metal ion binding ability of rat amylin(17–29) and (17–22). Taking into account the amino sequence of the native polypeptide it can be suggested that rIAPP(1–37) can also interact with copper( II ) ions, but no information is available for this system in the literature yet. The studied amino acids are not able to bind the metal ion separately, but altogether, in the hexapeptide are able to. Therefore, the length of the peptide was further reduced. Two tetrapeptide fragments of the hexapeptide were synthesized; the N-terminal fragment VRSS and the more promising C-terminal fragment SSNN. Two mutants of VRSS (VASS and VRAA) were also synthesized and studied for comparison.

The spectra refer to only one species with an absorption maximum at 527 nm. The formation of this band is accompanied only by the increase in the intensity. This supports the fact that, unlike the hexapeptide, only one complex is formed, and its concentration increases in parallel with the dissolution of the precipitate ( Fig. 4 ).

From Soup: 66 If we compare the UV-Vis spectra with those of rIAPP(17–29) and the hexapeptide, it can be seen that there is a small difference in the λ max values, and a significant difference in the molar absorption coefficients ( Fig. 5 ). This difference is more striking in the case of the CD spectra ( Fig. 6 ). The CD spectrum of VRSS is almost the reverse of the others.

From Soup: 67 Since the spectroscopic parameters of the peptide VRSS are significantly different from the rIAPP(17–22) hexapeptide, it does not mimic the metal binding ability of rIAPP(17–29). In order to establish whether the side chains of arginine and serine have any effect on the complex formation, two mutants of the peptide were studied. In the peptide VASS, the arginine is exchanged for an alanine , while in the peptide VRAA the two serines are exchanged for alanines.

From Soup: 69 However, there is a difference in the metal binding ability of the mutated peptides under strongly alkaline conditions. The weakest interaction was obtained with VRAA; the precipitate does not dissolve completely even above pH 11. The rising of the spectrum of VRAA refers to the fact that this ligand has the lowest metal binding ability, while this is nearly the same in the case of VASS and VRSS. According to these results, the role of the arginine side chain is negligible, while the serine side chain may play a role in the metal binding of amylin.

From Soup: 70 As in the case of the other two peptides rIAPP(17–29) and rIAPP(17–22), the complex formation starts above pH 5.5. Similarly to the hexapeptide, the complex formation is accompanied by slight precipitation in the physiological pH range, which is dissolved at pH 9. There is a continuous shift in the UV-Vis spectra , an absorption maximum can be seen around 570 nm at pH 8–9. This band is shifted to 539 nm in strongly basic solution. This is in accordance with the hexapeptide. The nature of the CD spectra is also similar to the hexapeptide and rIAPP(17–29). The UV-Vis spectra were also analysed by two computational programs. Similarly to rIAPP(17–29) and the hexapeptide fragment the data are fitted by three species; [CuH −2 L], [CuH −3 L] − and [CuH −4 L] 2 − .

From Soup: 74 On the basis of our data, we cannot decide which of the two modes is really realized; however, since an amide group of a polypeptide backbone cannot be deprotonated without the presence of an anchoring group , we prefer the first possibility. The alternative coordination [NH − (Asn 4 ), N 4 − ; H 2 O ; H 2 O ] gives a value of A z significantly smaller than that observed. It may be surprising that the coordination of only two deprotonated nitrogens gives such a high A z value; however, an examination of the bond lengths calculated for the coordination [NH − (Asn 4 ), N 4 − , CO(Asn 3 ); H 2 O ] reveals that both Cu –NH − (Asn) and Cu –O(carbonyl) distances are unusually short and this accounts for the high value of A z ( Table 7 ).

From Soup: 76 The subsequent deprotonation to give [CuH −4 L] 2 − can be attributed to the previous amide group (that of Ser 2 , NH − (Asn 4 ), N 4 − , N 3 − , N 2 − ), to the –OH side chain of Ser 2 (NH − (Asn 4 ), N 4 − , N 3 − , O − (Ser 2 )) or to the deprotonation of the equatorial water molecule of [CuH −3 L] − to give a OH − ion (NH − (Asn 4 ), N 4 − , N 3 − ; OH − ). On the basis of our results, the first of the three hypotheses is most probable: however, it involves also the weak axial interaction of –OH of the first serine of the chain (Ser 1 ) (3.308 Å, see below), that accounts for the observed slight decrease of A z with respect to [CuH −3 L] − .

Conversely, precipitation occurs with the shorter fragments. In the case of VRSSNN and SSNN the precipitate exists only in a narrow pH range (pH = 6–8). For the tetrapeptides containing seryl residues (VRSS and VASS) the precipitate dissolves only above pH 10, while in the case of VRAA, which contains only one amino acid with a polar side chain –arginine– the precipitate does not dissolve completely even above pH 11.

From Soup: 79 According to these results, the role of the arginine side chain is negligible, while the serine and asparagine side chains may play a role in the metal binding of amylin. If we compare the UV-Vis spectra of the six studied peptides it can be seen that there are two types of spectra . VRSS, VRAA and VASS are in the first group , SSNN and VRSSNN and VRSSNNLGPVLPP are in the second one.

The slight red shift of the absorption maxima and the lower molar absorption coefficient values may refer to an interaction of the polar side groups with copper( II ) ions. There is another difference in the UV-Vis spectra . In the case of the first group only one band can be seen, and its intensity increases with increasing pH. In the case of the second group there is a continuous shift to the lower wavelength values with increasing pH.

From Soup: 82 Since all types of spectra of rIAPP(17–29) show a high similarity to those of the hexa- and tetrapeptides with the sequences VRSSNN and SSNN respectively, the role of the asparaginyl and seryl residues can be supposed. The presence of many polar side chains in the SSNN fragment may protect the metal ion from hydrolysis and this interaction can induce the deprotonation of the side chain amide nitrogen of an Asn residue, followed by the metal binding of the preceding amide functions of the peptide backbone. Moreover, the results of this study reveal that, in addition to the well-known anchoring capability of the side chains of His and/or Cys residues, the amide group of asparagine can also be a primary metal binding site. However, in the latter case, the presence of a single Asn moiety is not satisfactory for effective metal binding but requires the involvement of a specific sequence containing polar amino acids .
