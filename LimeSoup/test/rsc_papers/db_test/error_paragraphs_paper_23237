From cou.: 1 Using coarse-grained nonequilibrium molecular dynamics, the dynamics of a blend of the equal ratio of immiscible polymers mixed with nanoparticles (NP) are simulated. The simulations are conducted under planar elongational flow, which affects the dispersion of the NPs and the self-assembly morphology. The goal of this study is to investigate the effect of planar elongational flow on the nanocomposite blend system as well as to thoroughly compare the blend to an analogous symmetric block copolymer (BCP) system to understand the role of the polymer structure on the morphology and NP dispersion. Two types of spherical NPs are considered: (1) selective NPs that are attracted to one of the polymer components and (2) nonselective NPs that are neutral to both components. A comparison of the blend and BCP systems reveals that for selective NP, the blend system shows a much broader NP distribution in the selective phase than the BCP phase. This is due to a more uniform distribution of polymer chain ends throughout the selective phase in the blend system than the BCP system. For nonselective NP, the blend and BCP systems show similar results for low elongation rates, but the NP peak in the BCP system broadens as elongation rates approach the order–disorder transition. In addition, the presence of NP is found to affect the morphology transitions of both the blend and BCP systems, depending on the NP type.

From cou.: 2 Nanocomposite materials have attracted great interest for their unique morphologies and improved thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties.1–3 The degree of improvement in such properties depends on the alignment and dispersion of the nanofillers; for example, the thermal conductivity of a composite is maximized when carbon nanotubes (CNT) are aligned,4 and electrical and mechanical properties improve when CNT are well dispersed.5 In addition, good dispersion can result in materials with improved optical and mechanical properties with applications in optoelectronics and catalysis.6,7 Nanofillers such as silica nanoparticles (NP), CNT, and graphene nanoribbons (GNR) tend to aggregate, so controlling the placement of nanofillers is a major challenge in their effective incorporation into composite materials. Placing NP at the interface between two phases can also lead to useful properties. For example, NP can serve as a binder between two materials that would otherwise phase separate, which has potential for fuel cell and battery applications.8

From cou.: 3 Nanocomposite materials can be fabricated by extensional flow, allowing the creation of fibers and sheets. A distinctive example process is electrospinning, which uses a powerful electric field to apply extensional strain rates of around 10000 s−1 on a polymer solution. This causes the polymer solution to extend into thin, high specific surface area fibers which are attractive for modern applications in separation, filtration, and sensing.9–11 The extensional strain in this process both creates the nanoscale fibers and plays a role in the placement of nanoscale additives within the fibers.12

From cou.: 4 For complex polymer systems such as block copolymers (BCP), which are known to self-assemble into mesoscale phases like cylinders and lamellae, shear and strain also affect the morphology and alignment of the material.13 The microstructures produced by self-assembly make these composites useful as templates for producing interesting nanostructured materials. For example, block copolymers can be used as “sacrificial” systems where one of the phases is removed by solvent, high temperature, or radiation. This leaves behind a mesoporous material that is applicable in membranes and battery separators. As an alternative to BCPs, which can be costly to synthesize, immiscible polymer blends may also have the potential to form ordered morphologies given the correct stimulus such as extensional strain.

From cou.: 5 The NPs in a self-assembled system can prefer one polymer type over another, or this result can be engineered by attaching ligands preferential to one polymer type. We will describe this type of NP as selective (S-NP). Alternatively, NPs may not prefer either phase or could have ligands attached that prefer both phases. These NPs will be described as nonselective (NS-NP). For the case of a “sacrificial” system, the NP should be selective towards the residual polymer to improve dispersion in the resulting material without losing its loading after the removal of sacrificial component.

From cou.: 6 The equilibrium placement of NP within a self-assembled structure is governed by thermodynamics. NP may be attracted to one phase or to each other, which corresponds to enthalpic benefits. In addition, there are enthalpic interactions between the self-assembled polymer phases which are affected by the presence of nanoparticles. Entropic considerations include the translational entropy of NP and the configurational entropy of polymer chains.14 For selective NP in BCPs, it has been found that NP are pushed towards the center of the phase, where the polymer chain ends concentrate.15 For nonselective NP, it might be predicted that the NP will disperse evenly through the material. However, experiments illustrate competing thermodynamic forces. Using BCP with gold NPs with ligands of both polymer types attached, Kramer found that NP tended to place at the interface of the phases.8 These NP reduced the unfavourable enthalpic interactions between the polymer blocks at the phase interface and acted as a bridge between the two dissimilar phases, resulting in decreased segregation between the phases. Simulation results also support that the reduction of polymer phase contact is a driving force for nonselective NP placement.16,17

From cou.: 7 While BCP13 and immiscible blend self-assembly and NP placement has been well-studied under equilibrium, there is less research into nonequilibrium conditions like extensional flow. This is in part due to the experimental challenges of studying systems with changing dimensions. Extensional deformation is of particular interest due to its use in the processing of polymer composites. The aforementioned electrospinning, as well as film molding and blow molding, subject polymer composites to high extensional deformation.18 It is therefore valuable to understand the effect of extensional flow on the self-assembly morphology and the placement of NP. However, when conducting an experiment involving extensional deformation one encounters constantly shrinking and expanding dimensions. Eventually the shrinking dimension becomes too small, resulting in the end of the experiment. This makes it challenging to run the experiment long enough to reach steady state. Experimental methods that have been used to study polymer systems under extensional flow, such as melt extrusion and Taylor cells, can only maintain the extensional flow on a given polymer chain for a short time scale.19,20

From cou.: 10 This work builds off the previous simulation work of Tran and Kalra, who simulated immiscible polymer blends without nanoparticles using the same approach as this paper.35 They found that at low elongation rates, the blend arranges in a perpendicular separation morphology that consist of one phase of each polymer type. The “perpendicular” signifies that the normal of the interface is perpendicular to the neutral z axis, which undergoes neither expansion nor compression. At higher elongation rates, perpendicular lamellae are formed. Above elongation rates of 0.5 MD units (∼109 s−1), the polymer blend can no longer maintain self-assembly and appears as a disordered state. In the present work, we introduce selective and nonselective NP, which has not been previously simulated for an immiscible blend of polymers.

From cou.: 12 We used coarse-grained non-equilibrium molecular dynamics to study the effect of elongation on nanocomposite systems. In this paper, properties are listed in their reduced form, which is a non-dimensionalization of the real values using the fundamental constants of bead mass (m), Lennard-Jones energy ε, and Lennard-Jones bond length σ. These constants are set to unity so that the reduced values of temperature T, elongation rate , and distance are represented in terms of combinations of mass, energy, and bond length. Polymers are modeled as bead-rod chains of ten beads while nanoparticles are modeled as a single bead. The bond length σ between consecutive polymer beads is fixed using the method of constraints described by Bruns et al.37 Pair-wise potentials were not applied between neighboring beads in the same chain.

From cou.: 18 NPs interact with the polymer chains differently if they are selective or nonselective. For selective nanoparticles, S-NP:A and S-NP:S-NP pair interactions are modeled by u2 and NP–B interactions are modeled by u1. Therefore, by design it is more energetically favourable for S-NP to be near A beads compared to B beads. For NS-NP, all three interactions are modeled by u2, meaning that NS-NP have no preference towards a particular type of polymer. A given simulation included only one type of NP: either selective (S-NP) or nonselective (NS-NP). The pair interactions are summarized in Table 1.

From cou.: 21 Planar elongational flow (PEF) with expansion in the x direction and compression in the y direction was implemented using the method described by Todd and Daivis.40 This approach relies on work by Kraynik and Reinelt that found that a lattice rotated at 31.7° to the x direction exhibited temporal and spatial periodicity under PEF.41 After a fixed Henky strain εp = 0.9624 the original lattice is reproduced. In terms of MD simulation, this allows the system boundaries to be rescaled to their original dimensions whenever εp is reached. When this occurs, particles are moved back into to the rescaled box using the periodic boundary conditions. Without this method, the simulation could not run beyond the time where the compressing dimension becomes smaller than the pair cutoff radius, preventing long-time simulations.

Visualizations were produced using the Visual Molecular Dynamics software. 45 Table 3 shows morphology transition strain rates, which are the elongation rate at which the morphology changes from perpendicular separation to perpendicular lamellae or perpendicular lamellae to disordered. At elongation rates typically lower than 0.05 MD units, the blend system self-assembles into a perpendicular separation morphology. The perpendicular designation indicates that the normal of the phase interface is perpendicular to the z -axis. At elongation rates typically between 0.05 and 0.5, the composite shows a perpendicular lamellae morphology, forming two pairs of lamellae. With a box length of 16.76, these lamellae have an average width of 4.19. Above an elongation rate of 0.5, the system enters a disordered phase where discrete phases are no longer observed. For the BCP system, only the transition between perpendicular separation and disordered is observed. These morphologies closely follow those simulated for the case of a blend without NP. 35

From Soup: 48 For BCPs, the self-assembly is caused by the chemical bonds between the unlike polymer types. For the blend, which has no connection between chains of different types, it is clear that in the absence of flow the polymers would fully phase separate. However, strong elongational flow can result in the formation of a metastable perpendicular lamellae morphology instead of full phase separation. The strong flow prevents the full phase separation of the blend by effectively confining the local regions of polymer into lamellae that are aligned to the flow direction and unable to come into contact with each other. This is supported by the full phase separation observed at low elongation rates, where the convection effect is not strong enough to prevent the contact and coalescence of blend lamellae. In addition, if a perpendicular separation starting state is used instead of an isotropic starting state, perpendicular lamellae did not form and the perpendicular separation morphology was found to persist until the order–disorder transition elongation rate. For flow rates near perpendicular separation – perpendicular lamellae transition, some blend simulations showed perpendicular lamellae structure initially before collapsing into perpendicular separation.

From Soup: 49 For the BCP/S-NP and BCP/NS-NP systems, a perpendicular lamellae morphology is observed below elongation rates of around 0.025 MD units, and a disordered morphology is observed above that point. In this case, the perpendicular lamellae morphology is a stable state which is caused by the bond between polymer A and B present in the BCP polymer.

From Soup: 50 Comparing the morphology transitions for the BCP and blend systems, it can be seen that the constraints imposed by the BCP structure cause a less stable structure in the presence of PEF. In BCP, two phases must be chemically bound at their interface, while in blend, the two phases move easily with respect to each other. As a result, the blend system can much more easily accommodate the strain created by PEF, resulting in a much higher perpendicular lamellae-disorder transition rate (0.5) than in BCP (0.025). The chemical bond across the phase interface also prevents the BCP system from exhibiting the perpendicular separation phase observed in the blend system.

For flow rates near perpendicular separation – perpendicular lamellae transition, some blend simulations showed perpendicular lamellae structure initially before collapsing into perpendicular separation.
From Soup: 51 The differences in morphology transition raise issues in comparing the BCP/S-NP system to the blend/S-NP system because at a given elongation rate, the systems have different morphology. For example, at an elongation rate of 0.01, the BCP system is in a perpendicular lamellae phase while the blend system is in a perpendicular separation phase. This means that the phase widths are not equal for the two systems at the same elongation rate. To address this, we will make two different comparisons between the blend/S-NP and BCP/S-NP systems: one where the morphology is the same and one where the elongation rate is the same. For the elongation rate comparison, we normalize by the phase width.

From cou.: 53 Comparing the morphology transitions for the BCP and blend systems, it can be seen that the constraints imposed by the BCP structure cause a less stable structure in the presence of PEF. In BCP, two phases must be chemically bound at their interface, while in blend, the two phases move easily with respect to each other. As a result, the blend system can much more easily accommodate the strain created by PEF, resulting in a much higher perpendicular lamellae-disorder transition rate (0.5) than in BCP (0.025). The chemical bond across the phase interface also prevents the BCP system from exhibiting the perpendicular separation phase observed in the blend system.
From Soup: 53 Fig. 2 shows the distribution of S-NP, polymer A, and polymer B for the perpendicular lamellae phase. The polymer distribution shapes were found to be similar to those observed by Tran and Kalra. 35 The lack of a rectangular shape of the A and B concentrations is attributed to the slight movement and distortions of the interface as the simulation progresses. As expected, S-NP tend to place within the polymer phase they are selective towards, polymer A. This results in a swelling of the A phase compared to the B phase. We can also note that NP distribution is relatively flat and well-distributed within the selective phase. Comparing blend to BCP, Fig. 3 shows that for increasing elongation rate but maintaining the perpendicular lamellae phase there is no change in the S-NP distribution. This can be understood by considering the effect of PEF on the polymer and the S-NP. For the polymer, PEF is expected to orient and stretch the polymer chains so that they are pointing along the expansive ( x ) direction and perpendicular to the compressive ( y ) direction. However, we can see from Table 4 that the blended polymers are already well aligned to the flow direction, as they have a large x -component and small y and z -components of the end-to-end vector. This means that the surroundings polymers are not changing significantly with elongation rate. For the NP, PEF is expected to disperse the NP. Since the NP are already well dispersed at lower elongation rates, the increase in elongation rate does not affect the distribution.
 ###### 
From cou.: 54 The differences in morphology transition raise issues in comparing the BCP/S-NP system to the blend/S-NP system because at a given elongation rate, the systems have different morphology. For example, at an elongation rate of 0.01, the BCP system is in a perpendicular lamellae phase while the blend system is in a perpendicular separation phase. This means that the phase widths are not equal for the two systems at the same elongation rate. To address this, we will make two different comparisons between the blend/S-NP and BCP/S-NP systems: one where the morphology is the same and one where the elongation rate is the same. For the elongation rate comparison, we normalize by the phase width.
From Soup: 54 Fig. 3 also shows that the S-NP in BCP concentrate at the center of the selective phase while the S-NP in blend do not. For BCP/S-NP, it has been found previously that S-NP concentrate at the center of the selective phase, 36 which is also found here. The difference in placement between the blend and BCP S-NP can be understood by examining the location of the polymer chain ends, shown in Fig. 4 . For the BCP, the chain ends lie in the middle of a phase, while the phase boundary is at the center of the chain where the polymer type changes. This leads microstates where S-NP lie near the chain ends to be entropically favourable, encouraging the placement of S-NP there. 16,36,46 The average orientation of the BCP chains is listed in Table 4 . They have a relatively large z -direction component, which is required for the BCP to be able to from lamellae. The BCP chains need to extend somewhat in the z direction so that they cross between two lamellae. However, PEF tries to force the chains into the x direction. Therefore, for the BCP system the chain orientation encouraged by PEF is working against the orientation needed for self-assembly. As the elongation rate increases, the BCP chains are forced more into the x direction and their z component is reduced. Once the z component is too small, it is impossible to form lamellae and a disordered phase is observed in the simulation, occurring at an elongation rate of 0.25.

From cou.: 55 Distribution of S-NP in blend and BCP.
From Soup: 55 For the polymer blend system, chain ends have no driving force to lie in the center of a phase because the immiscible polymers are no longer bonded. This is reflected in Fig. 4 . Since their chain ends are evenly distributed, NP are expected to be more spread out through the phase, which is the result obtained in Fig. 3 . We can see that the surrounding polymer allows a degree of control over the S-NP placement: the blend/S-NP leads to more dispersed S-NP than the BCP/S-NP system when both systems are in the same phase.

From cou.: 56 Fig. 2 shows the distribution of S-NP, polymer A, and polymer B for the perpendicular lamellae phase. The polymer distribution shapes were found to be similar to those observed by Tran and Kalra.35 The lack of a rectangular shape of the A and B concentrations is attributed to the slight movement and distortions of the interface as the simulation progresses. As expected, S-NP tend to place within the polymer phase they are selective towards, polymer A. This results in a swelling of the A phase compared to the B phase. We can also note that NP distribution is relatively flat and well-distributed within the selective phase. Comparing blend to BCP, Fig. 3 shows that for increasing elongation rate but maintaining the perpendicular lamellae phase there is no change in the S-NP distribution. This can be understood by considering the effect of PEF on the polymer and the S-NP. For the polymer, PEF is expected to orient and stretch the polymer chains so that they are pointing along the expansive (x) direction and perpendicular to the compressive (y) direction. However, we can see from Table 4 that the blended polymers are already well aligned to the flow direction, as they have a large x-component and small y and z-components of the end-to-end vector. This means that the surroundings polymers are not changing significantly with elongation rate. For the NP, PEF is expected to disperse the NP. Since the NP are already well dispersed at lower elongation rates, the increase in elongation rate does not affect the distribution.
From Soup: 56 To further support this conclusion, the BCP/S-NP and blend/S-NP systems are compared for the same elongation rates. For elongation rates 0.01–0.025, the BCP and blend systems show different morphologies. Therefore, we calculated the average distance of S-NP within the selective phase from the center of the phase. Shown in Table 5 , the perpendicular separation blend shows much larger average NP distance than the perpendicular lamellae blend due to the much larger phase width. When the average NP distance is normalized by the phase width, both the low and high elongation rate blend/S-NP normalized distances are significantly higher than the BCP/S-NP normalized distance. This supports the conclusion drawn in Fig. 3 that the blend system leads to significantly improved S-NP dispersion within the selective phase.
 ###### 
From cou.: 57 Fig. 3 also shows that the S-NP in BCP concentrate at the center of the selective phase while the S-NP in blend do not. For BCP/S-NP, it has been found previously that S-NP concentrate at the center of the selective phase,36 which is also found here. The difference in placement between the blend and BCP S-NP can be understood by examining the location of the polymer chain ends, shown in Fig. 4.

 ###### 
From cou.: 58 For the polymer blend system, chain ends have no driving force to lie in the center of a phase because the immiscible polymers are no longer bonded. This is reflected in Fig. 4. Since their chain ends are evenly distributed, NP are expected to be more spread out through the phase, which is the result obtained in Fig. 3. We can see that the surrounding polymer allows a degree of control over the S-NP placement: the blend/S-NP leads to more dispersed S-NP than the BCP/S-NP system when both systems are in the same phase.
From Soup: 58 Previous discussion of S-NP has limited the S-NP concentration to 10%. For 5% and 20% concentrations, we found that the S-NP similarly placed in the center of the selective phase for BCP, and distributed throughout the phase for blend. In addition, similar to the 10% case, the distributions were not affected by increasing elongation rate while maintaining the perpendicular lamellar morphology. Examining the normalized polymer chain end distribution for BCP/S-NP, shown in Fig. 5 , shows that at higher NP concentrations, the NP placing at the center of the selective phase are displacing the polymer chain ends, resulting in a broader polymer chain end distribution. In addition, as elongation rate increases the polymer chains are forced to align more towards the x direction, resulting in a slightly lower chain end distribution at the center. As for the 10% case, the blend polymer chain ends did not concentrate at the center of the phase, instead orienting along the x direction.
 ###### 
From cou.: 59 To further support this conclusion, the BCP/S-NP and blend/S-NP systems are compared for the same elongation rates.

 ###### 
From cou.: 60 Effect of S-NP concentration.
From Soup: 60 NS-NP were found to concentrate at the phase boundary for both blend and BCP systems, shown in Fig. 6 . Instead of the chain end placement as a driving force for NP distribution, as seen for S-NP, the NS-NP placement is motivated by a reduction in the unfavourable interactions between the two phases. Fig. 6 shows that for blend/NS-NP, elongation rate does not affect the NS-NP distribution. This is due to the unbound nature of the blend interface which allows the interface to easily adjust to increasing strain. The BCP system, with its bonded interface, cannot adjust so easily to the elongational strain. At an elongation rate of 0.005, the BCP/NS-NP distribution is similar to the distribution for the blend/NS-NP system, showing that far from the critical elongation rate the difference in interface plays a minor role in NS-NP distribution. However, as the elongation rate increases closer to the order–disorder transition at 0.02, the BCP chains face increasing force to align towards the flow direction and become less able to maintain an even, discrete interface. This results in a broadening of the NS-NP distribution corresponding to the coarsening of the interface. This is supported by Table 4 , which shows that at an elongation rate of 0.015 the average z direction length is 3.68. To have two pairs of lamellae in box size of 16.67, we would expect an average phase width of 4.17. The smaller z component indicates that the BCP chains are struggling to maintain the interface, which leads to a wider NS-NP distribution.

From Soup: 61 Fig. 7 shows again that BCP chain ends concentrate at the center of the phase while blend chain ends are more evenly distributed. However, in comparing the BCP/NS-NP chain ends to the BCP/S-NP chain ends in Fig. 4 , the BCP/NS-NP show a much sharper decrease in the peak value as elongation rate increases. This is due to a “crowding out” effect of the S-NP that limits the number of chain ends that can place at the center of the phase. The BCP/NS-NP, which has no NP placed in the center, can easily concentrate it chain ends at the center of the phase. Then, higher elongation rates force the chains to reorient towards the flow direction, moving some of the chain ends away from the center.

 ###### 
From cou.: 63 NS-NP were found to concentrate at the phase boundary for both blend and BCP systems, shown in Fig. 6. Instead of the chain end placement as a driving force for NP distribution, as seen for S-NP, the NS-NP placement is motivated by a reduction in the unfavourable interactions between the two phases. Fig. 6 shows that for blend/NS-NP, elongation rate does not affect the NS-NP distribution. This is due to the unbound nature of the blend interface which allows the interface to easily adjust to increasing strain.

The smaller z component indicates that the BCP chains are struggling to maintain the interface, which leads to a wider NS-NP distribution.
From Soup: 63 As the NS-NP reduce interfacial energy by placing between the two phases and preventing polymer interaction, we can expect that higher concentrations will lower the interfacial energy further. This is shown quantitatively in Table 6 by measuring the pairwise interaction energy between the two polymer types near the interface. For the 10% concentration, the energy is not much lower than the reference S-NP case, showing that the interface is only partially screened by the NS-NP. At higher concentrations, the energy drops significantly as the two polymer phases are prevented from interacting with each other by the NS-NP.
 ###### 
From cou.: 64 Fig. 7 shows again that BCP chain ends concentrate at the center of the phase while blend chain ends are more evenly distributed. However, in comparing the BCP/NS-NP chain ends to the BCP/S-NP chain ends in Fig. 4, the BCP/NS-NP show a much sharper decrease in the peak value as elongation rate increases. This is due to a “crowding out” effect of the S-NP that limits the number of chain ends that can place at the center of the phase. The BCP/NS-NP, which has no NP placed in the center, can easily concentrate it chain ends at the center of the phase. Then, higher elongation rates force the chains to reorient towards the flow direction, moving some of the chain ends away from the center.
From Soup: 64 This screening effect stabilizes morphologies with more interface surface area. To examine this, we first compare the order–disorder transition elongation rates for varying concentrations in Table 3 . For both BCP/NS-NP and blend/NS-NP, increasing concentration of NS-NP decreases the order–disorder transition. The disordered phase, which in the absence NS-NP has large unfavourable interactions between the A and B phases, becomes much more energetically favourable when increased amounts of screening NS-NP are present. The blend system is found to handle increased loading better than the BCP system, as it was able to form ordered phases at a concentration of 40% while the BCP system could not. The BCP system effectively has a limited amount of space at its interface for NS-NP to place due to its inability to phase separate. As a result, at high loading NS-NP must place elsewhere in the phases, decreasing the selectivity of the phases.
 ###### 
From cou.: 65 Effect of NS-NP concentration.
From Soup: 65 The NS-NP also prevent the formation of a perpendicular separation phase for blend/NS-NP at a concentration of 40%, listed in Table 3 . With so many NS-NP, the NP can saturate four interfaces as easily as two, making the interfacial energy difference between the perpendicular lamellae and perpendicular separation phases negligible. This is illustrated in Fig. 8 . The increased entropy of the perpendicular lamellae phase causes it to be preferential in this situation. The high concentration of NP at the interface also stabilizes the perpendicular lamellae in the polymer blend by preventing contact between lamellae of the same polymer type.
 ###### 
From cou.: 66 As the NS-NP reduce interfacial energy by placing between the two phases and preventing polymer interaction, we can expect that higher concentrations will lower the interfacial energy further. This is shown quantitatively in Table 6 by measuring the pairwise interaction energy between the two polymer types near the interface. For the 10% concentration, the energy is not much lower than the reference S-NP case, showing that the interface is only partially screened by the NS-NP. At higher concentrations, the energy drops significantly as the two polymer phases are prevented from interacting with each other by the NS-NP.
From Soup: 66 Using molecular dynamics, we have studied the effect of planar elongation flow on immiscible polymer blend/NP composites and compared the NP dispersion and morphology to the block copolymer analogue. For selective NP, the blend system showed much better dispersion of the NP throughout the selective phase than the BCP system. For nonselective NP, both blend and BCP systems showed similar concentrations at the interface, but the blend system was able handle higher NP loading. In general, the blend system allows a greater range of elongation rates and more possible morphologies, a potential advantage for processing. The main difference between the BCP and blend systems, namely the presence of a chemical bond across the phase interface, explains the difference in both NP distribution and morphology transitions. Overall, the strength of elongational flow had little effect on the NP distribution for the blend case beyond controlling the self-assembly morphology. For the BCP case, the strength of the flow played a larger role, especially for the nonselective case. This difference was found to be a result of the BCP chains desiring to orient in the non-flow ( z ) direction to maintain the self-assembly morphology, while the blend chains were able to orient in the flow direction independent of their morphology.
 ###### 
From cou.: 67 This screening effect stabilizes morphologies with more interface surface area. To examine this, we first compare the order–disorder transition elongation rates for varying concentrations in Table 3. For both BCP/NS-NP and blend/NS-NP, increasing concentration of NS-NP decreases the order–disorder transition. The disordered phase, which in the absence NS-NP has large unfavourable interactions between the A and B phases, becomes much more energetically favourable when increased amounts of screening NS-NP are present. The blend system is found to handle increased loading better than the BCP system, as it was able to form ordered phases at a concentration of 40% while the BCP system could not. The BCP system effectively has a limited amount of space at its interface for NS-NP to place due to its inability to phase separate. As a result, at high loading NS-NP must place elsewhere in the phases, decreasing the selectivity of the phases.
