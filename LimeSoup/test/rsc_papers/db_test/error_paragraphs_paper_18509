From cou.: 1 We characterized valence-type and dipole-bound anionic states of uracil using various electronic structure methods. We found that the most stable anion is related to neither the canonical 2,4-dioxo nor a rare imino-hydroxy tautomer. Instead, it is related to an imino-oxo tautomer, in which the N1H proton is transferred to the C5 atom. This valence anion is characterized by an electron vertical detachment energy (VDE) of 1267 meV and it is adiabatically stable with respect to the canonical neutral by 3.93 kcal mol−1. It is also more stable by 2.32 and 5.10 kcal mol−1 than the dipole-bound and valence anion, respectively, of the canonical tautomer. The VDE values for the former and the latter are 73 and 506 meV, respectively. Another, anionic, low-lying imino-oxo tautomer with a VDE of 2499 meV has a proton transferred from N3H to C5. It is less stable than the neutral canonical tautomer by 1.38 kcal mol−1. The mechanism of formation of anionic tautomers with the carbon C5 protonated may involve intermolecular proton transfer or dissociative electron attachment to the canonical neutral tautomer followed by a barrier-free attachment of a hydrogen atom to C5. The six-member ring structure of anionic tautomers with carbon atoms protonated might be unstable upon an excess electron detachment. Indeed, the neutral systems resulting from electron detachment from anionic tautomers with carbon atoms protonated evolve along barrier-free decomposition pathways to a linear or a bicyclo structure, which might be viewed as lesions to RNA. Within the PCM hydration model, the low-lying valence anions become adiabatically bound with respect to the canonical neutral and the two most stable tautomers have carbon atoms protonated.

From cou.: 2 The nucleic acid bases (NABs) are basic elements of DNA and RNA, which are responsible for storing and translating genetic information in cells. Low-energy electrons and hydroxyl radicals are among the most reactive species formed upon interaction of high-energy radiation with living cells. Low-energy electrons might become trapped on nucleic acid bases and the resulting radical anions might participate in chemical reactions, which can lead to DNA damage.1,2 Furthermore, the charged states of nucleic acid bases play a key role in the electron and hole transfer phenomena in DNA.3–6

From cou.: 3 In the past, a large number of theoretical and experimental studies were focused on determination of electron affinity of NABs in the gas- and condensed phases. Anions of hydrated NABs are believed to support an excess electron on a valence-type molecular orbital as suggested by much experimental7 as well as theoretical data.8,9 However, the existence of stable anions of NABs in the gas phase has long been a point of discussion. Early computational studies had predicted negative values of adiabatic electron affinity (AEA).10 An important development occurred in the mid 90’s when Adamowicz and co-workers found stable but loosely bound anionic states supported primarily by large dipole moments of neutral NABs.11 These anionic states were later characterized in photoelectron spectroscopy (PES),12 Rydberg electron transfer (RET) spectroscopy,13,14 and photodetachment-photoelectron experiments.15

From cou.: 4 Dipole-bound anions are strongly perturbed by other atoms or molecules16 and their relevance in condensed phase environments is questionable. In clusters of polar molecules or in polar solvents they are typically replaced by solvated electrons17 or solvated anions.18 Solvated electrons and valence anionic states are expected to play a role in biochemical processes driven by thermalized excess electrons.19 Dipole-bound anions of NAB’s evolve upon solvation into valence type anions, as reported by Bowen and co-workers.18,20

From cou.: 5 Much less is known experimentally about valence anionic states of isolated NABs in the gas phase. Aflatooni et al.21 characterized temporary anionic states of NABs in electron transmission spectroscopy experiments and reported an electron vertical attachment energy (VAE) of −0.22 eV for uracil. Huels et al. reported anions of thymine and cytosine with lifetimes exceeding 10 μs, which were obtained by resonant attachment of subionization electrons.22 Schiedt et al. extrapolated the electron affinity of isolated uracil from the results obtained for hydrated uracil with the final prediction being 150 ± 120 meV.15 The extrapolation might be slightly erroneous since a linear extrapolation might not be valid for the first water molecule bound to uracil.23

From cou.: 6 The computational studies of anionic states of uracil8,11,14,24–28 were limited to the canonical 2,4-dioxo tautomer and interpretations of the experimental studies12–15,20 referred to the same tautomer. We summarized these findings in Fig. 1, with relative energies based on the results of the current study. The planar Cs symmetry uracil with a dipole moment of ca. 4.2 D supports a dipole-bound anionic state with the experimental VDE of 93 ± 7,12 54 ± 35,13 85 ± 15,14 and 86 ± 815 meV. The valence anionic state with the excess electron on a π* antibonding orbital is unbound at the equilibrium geometry of the neutral.21 Upon “puckering” of the ring, which may be initially viewed as a distortion of the molecular framework along a combination of a″ modes, the energy of the neutral, and therefore of the dipole-bound anion, increases, while the resonance position of the π* state decreases approaching the energy of the neutral. Further along this distortion, the π* state becomes bound with respect to the neutral and undergoes a crossing with the dipole-bound state. The coupling of these two anionic states has recently been studied to determine rates of the intramolecular electron transfer from the dipole-bound to valence orbitals.25 Finally, a minimum of C1 symmetry develops for the valence anion which is vertically bound with respect to the neutral by 506 meV. The anion remains, however, adiabatically unbound by 51 meV, in agreement with the predictions of Ortiz et al. based on many-body perturbation, coupled-cluster, and electron propagator results.24 Other computational results obtained with various exchange–correlation functionals suggested small but positive values of AEA, typically in the 0.05–0.25 eV range.14,26–28 Unfortunately, an overestimation of electron binding energy typical for these approaches is of the same order of magnitude as the reported values of AEA.

From cou.: 7 Early PES12,15 and RET spectroscopy13 studies identified only dipole-bound anion of isolated uracil, with some results being obscured by artifacts resulting from the (U–H)− species.13 The results of more recent RET spectroscopy studies indicated, however, that dipole-bound and valence anions might coexist.14 It was found that anions of uracil obtained in the course of evaporation of argon atoms from the U−(Ar)n clusters do no completely detach the excess electron with electric fields up to 35 kV cm−1, which is typical for valence anions but in clear contrast with the behavior of dipole-bound anions.14 Moreover, their reported Rydberg n-dependencies for the formation of U−(Ar)0 and U−(Ar)1 in collisions between laser excited Xe(nf) atoms and uracil seeded in argon, at high beam densities, are typical for the creation rates observed for conventional valence anions. Unfortunately, the values of AEA or VDE for the valence anion of uracil could not be measured with these experimental techniques.

From cou.: 8 The very recent results from the group of Bowen demonstrate that the dipole-bound anion is not the only anionic form of uracil detectable in the PES experiments.29 These authors observed a broad feature with a maximum at ca. 2.5 eV. This feature can not be associated with either the dipole-bound anion or the valence anion of the canonical tautomer, as the latter is characterized by a VDE of only 0.3–0.5 eV.24 Apparently, a new anionic form of uracil has been observed.

From cou.: 11 In this report we have identified and characterized the most stable tautomers of anionic uracil. Our recent hypothesis about valence anionic states of NABs was presented in a computational study on 1-methylcytosine.37 We suggested that the most stable valence anions of NABs might be related to the tautomers that are very unstable as neutral species. We dubbed them “very rare tautomers” to discriminate these tautomers from conventional “rare tautomers”. In the case of uracil, conventional “rare tautomers” are of the imino-hydroxy type with the N1 and/or N3 atom deprotonated and the O7 and/or O8 atoms protonated. On the other hand, “very rare tautomers” that we have in mind are those in which the N1 or N3 atoms are deprotonated and the C5 or C6 atoms are protonated. A hint that the tautomerization involving carbon atoms might be advantageous for anionic NABs came from our earlier studies on intermolecular proton transfer in complexes involving valence anions of NABs.18,38–44 Although in these earlier studies we considered primarily proton transfer to the O8 and O7 atoms of uracil or thymine and the N3 and O7 atoms of cytosine,18,38–42 recently we have recognized that the C5 and C6 carbon sites are thermodynamically preferable for intermolecular proton transfer to the anion of a pyrimidinic NAB.43 Thus, these sites have the largest proton affinity for the canonical tautomers of the anionic bases. Indeed, the results of electron spin resonance investigation of γ-irradiated DNA indicate that the valence anion of thymine is protonated at the C6 position.45 In ref. 37, which was focused on valence anions of 1-methylcytosine, we demonstrated that not only intermolecular but also intramolecular proton transfer, i.e., tautomerization, might favor carbon sites.

From cou.: 12 The main finding of the current study, which is based on coupled-cluster calculations with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations, is that anionic imino-oxo tautomers of uracil with a nitrogen atom deprotonated and the C5 or C6 atom protonated are unusually stable. An adiabatically bound valence anion is reported here. We also demonstrate that the six-member ring structure of very rare tautomers might be unstable upon excess electron detachment.

From cou.: 13 We use the following notation for the neutral and anionic tautomers. The neutral canonical tautomer is named “nUcan” and the related valence anion “aUvalcan”. The anionic dipole bound state of this tautomer is labeled “aUdbscan”. The names of the remaining tautomers of uracil reflect these intramolecular proton transfers that lead from Ucan to the tautomer at hand. For example, a neutral imino-hydroxy tautomer with the N1H site deprotonated and the O7 site protonated is labelled nUo7nl. In addition, prefixes “a” and “na” are used to distinguish properties of the anion and the neutral, respectively, determined at the minimum energy geometry of the anion.

From cou.: 14 Various tautomers and rotamers of uracil, with an excess electron on a valence-type orbital, were initially considered at the density functional level of theory with a B3LYP exchange–correlation functional46–48 and 6-31++G** basis set49 (5d representation), see Table S1 and Fig. S1 in the supplementary information.† The initial structures were systematically selected using the following approach: we chose the N1, N3, C5, and C6 atoms as possible proton donors and O7, O8, C2, C4, C5, and C6 as possible proton acceptors. Next, we selected 38 tautomers, with the total number of initial structures being 75, because various rotamers were also considered. In the selection process we considered all chemically meaningful single proton transfers and a limited set of multiple proton transfers. The selection of structures is not complete from the combinatorial perspective but all structures that we believe are chemically meaningful, were included. The B3LYP/6-31++G** energy minimizations for the anionic tautomers of uracil were initiated from “buckled” structures. The converged structures were indeed frequently buckled. In Table S1 and Fig. S1 we report the results for the most stable rotamer of each tautomer.†

Next, thermal corrections as well as the entropy terms, calculated at either the B3LYP or MP2 levels for T = 298 K and p = 1 atm in the harmonic oscillator-rigid rotor approximation, were included to derive the relative stability in terms of Gibbs free energy. The stability of anions measured in terms of Gibbs free energy with respect to nUcan will be labeled AEAG.

From cou.: 43 The canonical tautomer nUcan is the most stable at every level of theory in terms of energy, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy (Tables S2 and 1, and Fig. 3).† At the CCSD(T)//MP2 level the second most stable tautomer, imino-hydroxy nU07nl, is less stable by 10.1 and 10.2 kcal mol−1 in terms of E + ZPVE and Gibbs free energy, respectively. This result is consistent with experimental findings that the nUcan tautomer is the most stable in the gas phase, as well as in solution.32,33 The high stability of nUcan in comparison with rare tautomers might be important for informational fidelity of nucleic acids.

The high stability of nUo7o8nln3 may be related to the fact that its double bonds are conjugated, whereas they are isolated in nUo7nl and nUo8n3. The instability of two hydroxy-oxo and the dihydroxy tautomers reported by us, 10.19 kcal mol−1 < ΔG < 10.83 kcal mol−1 is only slightly larger than the instability of 9.6 kcal mol−1 of the most abundant minor tautomer determined by Fuji et al.32,33 These authors reported an electronic spectrum of uracil with a well-resolved fluorescence exhibiting sharp features assigned to the 2,4-dioxo and hydroxy-oxo tautomers.

From cou.: 45 The calculated instability of 10.19 kcal mol−1 < ΔG < 10.83 kcal mol−1 is, however, much smaller than the experimental instability of 19 ± 6 kcal mol−1 reported by Beak et al. for the 2-oxo-4-hydroxy tautomer.31 Our results, on the other hand, are in excellent agreement with those of Piacenza and Grimme35 obtained at the QCISD/TZV(2df,2pd) level, with triple contributions estimated at the QCISD(T)/TZV(d,p) level. This agreement suggests that further improvements resulting from using better than AVDZ basis sets will not be significant, and implies that the experimental results of Beak et al.31 might be inaccurate. Our results are in less satisfactory agreement with the QCISD/6-311+G(2d,p) results of Wolken and Turecek.34 Lower level methods, such as MP2 and B3LYP, fail to predict correctly the relative stability of the nUo7nl, nUo8n3, and nUo7o8nln3 tautomers, see Table 1.

From cou.: 47 A significant dipole moment of nUcan, 4.38 D at the MP2/AVDZ level, supports a dipole-bound state11 and the resulting anion will be adiabatically bound with respect to the neutral. Other neutral tautomers of uracil might also be very polar. For instance, the dipole moment of nUo8n3 is larger by ca. 0.4 D than that of nUcan, see Table S2.† However, the instability of nUo8n3 with respect to nUcan by ca. 11 kcal mol−1, see Table 1, is too large to be compensated by the excess electron attachment. Thus we will discuss in this study only one dipole-bound anion, aUdbscan.

From cou.: 48 Our preliminary B3LYP/6-31++G** searches for vertically bound valence anions of uracil in the gas phase ended up with positive results for 36 tautomers, see Table S1.† Four most stable structures, aUc5nl, aUvalcan, aUc5n3 and aUc6nl, have been considered at higher levels of theory. The structures were reoptimized at the MP2/AVDZ level and final energies were calculated at the CCSD(T)/AVDZ level, see Table 2 and Fig. 5. All four anions remain vertically bound at the MP2 level, which makes the converged structures reliable, and they maintain their vertical electronic stability at the CCSD(T) level.

From cou.: 49 Our main finding is that the most stable valence anion is aUc5nl, which is unrelated to any low-lying tautomer of neutral uracil. The anion aUc5nl is characterized by an electron vertical detachment energy of 1267 meV, see Table 2, and it is adiabatically stable with respect to the canonical neutral nUcan by 3.93 kcal mol−1, see Fig. 5. To our best knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adiabatic electron stability of a valence anion of a nucleic acid base obtained at a reliable level of theory, such as CCSD(T)/AVDZ. One might speculate that the aUc5nl anion was observed in the RET spectroscopy experiments by Schermann et al.14 Unfortunately, these authors could not provide estimations of the VDE and AEA values for their valence anion. It is clear, however, that the dominant feature in the recent PES spectrum of anionic uracil recorded by Bowen et al.29 is unrelated to the aUc5nl anion. A maximum at 2.5 eV in the PES spectrum differs drastically from the calculated value of VDE for aUc5nl of 1267 meV.

From cou.: 50 The anion aUc5nl is also more stable by 5.10 kcal mol−1 than the anion based on the canonical tautomer. The latter, aUvalcan, is adiabatically unbound with respect to nUcan by 51 meV = 1.17 kcal mol−1. The CCSD(T)/AVDZ contribution from electronic energies to the AEA amounts to −3.46 kcal mol−1. The MP2/AVDZ contribution from zero-point vibrations suppresses the AEA to −1.17 kcal mol−1. aUcan is characterized by a VDE of 506 meV. Thus, this anionic tautomer was also not probed in the recent PES experiments.29 Earlier reports suggested that the valence anion of this tautomer might be adiabatically bound.26–28 These results, however, were obtained at the density functional level of theory with exchange–correlation functionals that frequently overestimate the excess electron binding energy.

Thus we will discuss in this study only one dipole-bound anion, a U dbs can .
 ###### 
From cou.: 51 Another low-lying anionic tautomer with a carbon atom protonated, aUc5n3, is only 0.21 kcal mol−1 less stable than aUvalcan and its VDE amounts to 2499 meV, see Table 2 and Fig. 6. This value of VDE is very similar to a maximum at ca. 2.5 eV of the main feature in the photoelectron spectrum of anionic uracil recorded by Bowen et al.29 The agreement between the experimental and calculated VDEs is, however, intriguing. aUc5n3 is the third most stable valence anion of uracil. Thus, if thermodynamic stability was the dominant factor then two other valence anions, aUc5nl and aUcan, should be also populated in the molecular beam. Surprisingly, this is not the case.

From cou.: 52 The fourth most stable tautomer of valence anion, aUc6nl, has again a carbon atom protonated, this time C6 rather than C5. It is adiabatically unstable with respect to nUcan by 6.34 kcal mol−1, see Fig. 5. The neutral system at the anionic geometry is not well described by a single-reference wave function. Indeed, the values of VDE calculated at the CCSD and CCSD(T) levels, 3842 and 2822 meV, respectively, differ significantly, see Table 2 and Fig. 6. We conclude that the CCSD(T) level of theory might be not sufficient for this tautomer.

From cou.: 53 The effect of hydration was studied at the B3LYP/6-31++G** level within the PCM model using the optimal gas phase geometries, see Table 3. Within this model, all four anionic tautomers are adiabatically bound with respect to the neutral nUcan. The tautomer aUc5nl remains the most stable with a VDE of 3.56 eV but the relative stability of other anionic tautomers is different than in the gas phase. aUc5n3 becomes the second most stable anion, which is less stable than aUc5nl by 2.29 kcal mol−1 and is characterized by a VDE of 4.14 eV. The anion of the canonical tautomer comes third in stability, 5.31 kcal mol−1 less stable than aUc5nl, with a VDE of 2.75 eV. The aUc5nl tautomer might be biologically irrelevant because a sugar unit is connected to the N1 site. The aUc5n3 tautomer, however, might be biologically relevant.

 ###### 
From cou.: 54 Many anionic tautomers of uracil are vertically electronically bound in the gas phase. The vertical electronic stability is accompanied by serious geometrical relaxations with respect to the structure of the corresponding neutrals. The neutral tautomer nUcan is planar and so is the tautomer aUc6nl, whereas other valence anions are “buckled”. The difference between aUc6nl and other valence anions might be related to a difference in the charge distribution of the unpaired electron, see Fig. 6. A serious buckling develops in consequence of localization of the π* electron in the C4–C5–C6 region. These geometrical distortions involve both hydrogen and heavy atoms. As measures of nonplanarity we use deviations from 0° of dihedral angles N1C6C5C4 and N1C2N3C4. Their values are, respectively, −42 and −15° in aUc5nl, 17 and 4° in aUcan, and −40 and −4° in aUc5n3. Thus, it is not surprising that the energy of the neutral is much higher at the optimal anionic geometry than at its minimum energy structure. Indeed, the energy of the neutral increases by 27.91, 15.12 and 61.63 kcal mol−1 for aUc5nl, aUcan, and aUc5n3, respectively, in comparison with the minimum energy structure of the neutral nUcan. The corresponding values of VDE are only 29.2, 11.7 and 57.6 kcal mol−1, which render only the aUc5nl tautomer adiabatically bound. Strong distortions of molecular frameworks are characteristic for valence anionic states.
From Soup: 54 Another low-lying anionic tautomer with a carbon atom protonated, a U c5 n3 , is only 0.21 kcal mol −1 less stable than a U val can and its VDE amounts to 2499 meV, see Table 2 and Fig. 6 . This value of VDE is very similar to a maximum at ca . 2.5 eV of the main feature in the photoelectron spectrum of anionic uracil recorded by Bowen et al. 29 The agreement between the experimental and calculated VDEs is, however, intriguing. a U c5 n3 is the third most stable valence anion of uracil .

From cou.: 55 What might be formation pathways for the aUc5nl, aUc5n3, and aUc6nl anions? We calculated barriers for the unimolecular proton transfer from aUvalcan to aUc6nl and from aUc6nl to aUc5nl and the results are summarized in Fig. 7. In view of the high barriers, 43.5 and 29.7 kcal mol−1, respectively, the unimolecular tautomerizations are not probable at standard conditions. The barriers are even higher when effects of hydration are taken into account within the PCM model, see Table 3. Formation of the anionic tautomers with carbon atoms protonated might proceed through intermolecular proton transfers, with acidic and basic sites interacting with aUvalcan. These solvent-assisted pathways have typically lower energy barriers than intramolecular tautomerizations,65–67 but this mechanism is beyond the scope of this project. Here we point out that dissociative electron attachment to nUcan followed by a barrier-free attachment of a hydrogen atom to the C5 atom of the deprotonated uracil might be an efficient pathway to the aUc5nl and aUc5n3 tautomers. Indeed, it was demonstrated in the experiments of Illenberger et al. and Märk et al.68–70 that nitrogen sites of NABs are the most susceptible to dehydrogenation in the course of dissociative electron attachment:

Electron correlation effects are expected to be very significant for this system because dipole moment of the neutral is seriously overestimated at the Hartree–Fock (HF) level of theory. Indeed, our HF value of the dipole moment of 5.13 D is reduced to 4.38 D at the MP2 level of theory, with the experimental value in dioxane at 25 °C being estimated at 4.2 D. 71 In addition to the dipole moment correction, there are usually significant dynamic correlation effects between the excess electron and the electrons of the neutral molecule. 72 The two effects have opposite signs for the dipole-bound anion of uracil .

From Soup: 80 The CCSD(T) value of AEA for a U dbs can is 71 meV, see Table 2 . Thus, this anionic state is adiabatically bound with respect to n U can by 1.61 kcal mol −1 , see Fig. 5 , and is only 2.32 kcal mol −1 less stable than the valence anion a U c5 nl . In addition to a U dbs can , the canonical tautomer supports also a valence bound state, a U val can , which is less stable than the former by 2.78 kcal mol −1 , see Figs. 1 and 5 . The valence state is, however, unbound at the optimal (planar) geometry of a U dbs can . On the contrary, the dipole-bound state is bound at the optimal (buckled) geometry of a U val can because the dipole moment of the neutral remains significant at this geometry. In fact, it becomes larger by 0.17 D in comparison with the optimal geometry of a U dbs can . In conclusion, at the buckled local minimum of the valence anion, there is also a bound excited state, which has dipole-bound character, and the vertical excitation energy amounts to ca . 400–430 meV. Our calculated value of AEA of 71 meV is in good agreement with an earlier theoretical result of 25 meV, 24 determined at the MP2 level with a 6-311++G** basis set supplemented with a set of additional diffuse s and p functions. As suggested in ref. 24 , the results of earlier theoretical studies 11 might be unreliable due to inconsistency in molecular geometries of the neutral and the anion.

From cou.: 81 Upon an excess electron attachment to the sp-type diffuse hybrid, see Fig. 6, there is only a minor geometrical relaxation and the molecular framework retains the Cs symmetry. The dipole moment of the neutral increases by ca. 0.10 D from the optimal geometry of the neutral to the optimal geometry of the anion. The excess electron is localized on the positive pole of the molecular dipole, with the negative pole being determined by the two carbonyl groups.
From Soup: 81 Next, let us turn to the analysis of VDE for a U dbs can , see Table 4 . The Koopmans’ theorem contribution of 30 meV is followed by a non-negligible SCF induction term of 7 meV. The resulting values of D SCF of 37 meV reproduces only 51% of the CCSD(T) value of D . The MP2 dispersion contribution is larger than the Koopmans’ theorem term and the MP2 non-dispersion term is destabilizing because the MP2 dipole moment of the neutral is much smaller than the SCF dipole moment. The resulting value of D MP2 of 52 meV reproduces 71% of D CCSD(T) . A contribution from higher-than-second-order correlation terms limited to single and double excitations is significant and amounts to 19 meV. A relatively small contribution from triple excitations, 3 meV, implies that the final CCSD(T) values of D of 73 meV might be close to the methodologically converged result. Indeed, the four experimental values of VDE, 93 ± 7, 12 54 ± 35, 13 85 ± 15, 14 and 86 ± 8 15 meV, are in good agreement with our prediction. The values of VDE predicted by Ortiz et al. , with a 6-311++G** basis set supplemented with a set of additional diffuse s and p functions, were 54 and 57 meV at the MP2 and OVGF levels of theory, respectively, 24 and are in good agreement with our predictions.
 ###### 
From cou.: 82 The CCSD(T) value of AEA for aUdbscan is 71 meV, see Table 2. Thus, this anionic state is adiabatically bound with respect to nUcan by 1.61 kcal mol−1, see Fig. 5, and is only 2.32 kcal mol−1 less stable than the valence anion aUc5nl. In addition to aUdbscan, the canonical tautomer supports also a valence bound state, aUvalcan, which is less stable than the former by 2.78 kcal mol−1, see Figs. 1 and 5. The valence state is, however, unbound at the optimal (planar) geometry of aUdbscan. On the contrary, the dipole-bound state is bound at the optimal (buckled) geometry of aUvalcan because the dipole moment of the neutral remains significant at this geometry. In fact, it becomes larger by 0.17 D in comparison with the optimal geometry of aUdbscan. In conclusion, at the buckled local minimum of the valence anion, there is also a bound excited state, which has dipole-bound character, and the vertical excitation energy amounts to ca. 400–430 meV.

From Soup: 82 A maximum of the dominant feature at ca . 2.5 eV in the photoelectron spectrum of anionic uracil recorded by Bowen et al. 29 differs from the values of VDE of 1267 and 506 meV for the two most stable valence anionic tautomers, a U c5 nl and a U val can , respectively. Thus, this anionic tautomer was not probed in the photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. 29 The maximum at 2.5 eV matches, however, the VDE value of 2499 meV for the third most stable valence anionic tautomer, a U c5 n3 . Among these valence anionic tautomers only a U c5 nl appears to be adiabatically bound with respect to the neutral n U can . A theoretical determination of lifetimes of the adiabatially unbound valence anionic tautomers is of utmost importance for facilitating further interplay between theory and experiment in gas phase studies of anions of NABs. These lifetimes might be very large because the anions are vertically strongly bound at their respective minima and significant molecular distortions might be required to reach crossings of the potential energy surfaces of the neutral and the anion.

From Soup: 83 The PES spectra of anionic complexes of uracil or thymine with weak acids frequently displayed two features. 18,38 The first feature, with a smaller electron binding energy, was assigned to a complex in which valence anion of the canonical tautomer interacted with a weak acid. 18,38–44 The second feature, however, with an electron binding energy typically exceeding 2 eV, escaped so far a theoretical interpretation. For instance, it could not be related to formation of the neutral in the lowest triplet state in the course of electron photodetachment. 38 It is plausible that the second PES feature might result from complexes in which valence anion of a tautomer with a carbon atom protonated interacts with a weak acid.

From Soup: 84 The consistency of theoretical values of AEA and VDE at the MP2, CCSD, and CCSD(T) levels for the three most stable valence anionic tautomers, see Table 2 , strengthens our conclusions about: (i) the gas phase adiabatic stability of a U c5 nl and instability of other valence anions, and (ii) vertical electronic stability of these anionic tautomers. Thermal effects and entropy contributions calculated at standard conditions do not affect much the stability of the anions with respect to n U can , see the values of AEA and AEA G in Table 2 .

From Soup: 85 The accuracies of the B3LYP method and the PCM model are not sufficient to make reliable predictions of relative stabilities that differ by less than 1 kcal mol −1 . However, the tautomer a U c5 nl is predicted as the most stable both in the gas phase and in the PCM hydration model. This tautomer and a U c5 n3 , which is the second most stable tautomer in the PCM hydration model, have significantly larger values of the VDE than the a U val can tautomer. So far, the attention of experimentalists and theorists was focused on the dipole-bound and valence anions of the canonical tautomer. We believe that further experimental and theoretical explorations of valence anions based on the tautomers with protonated carbon atoms, such as a U c5 nl and a U c5 n3 , would be highly desirable.

From Soup: 86 The unpaired electron in a U val can is localized primarily in the C4–C5–C6 region, see Fig. 6 . It is then not surprising that the C5 and C6 sites have a significant proton affinity and the tautomers resulting from proton transfer from N1H or N3H to C5 or C6 might be quite stable. The unpaired electron in the a U c6 nl tautomer has, however, a qualitatively different distribution than in a U can , see Fig. 6 . These distributions and relative stabilities of the resulting anionic tautomers can be naturally determined in the course of quantum chemical electronic structure calculations.

From Soup: 87 The high stability of the anionic tautomers with carbon atoms protonated implies that excess electrons can affect the structure of RNA by favoring the very rare tautomers of uracil . An important feature of the a U c5 n3 and a U c6 n3 tautomers is that the six-member ring structure is unstable upon the detachment of an excess electron, see Fig. 4 , as determined at the MP2 level of theory. Indeed, the neutral systems resulting from electron detachment from a U c5 n3 and a U c6 n3 evolve along barrier-free decomposition pathways to a linear or a bicyclo structure, respectively, which might be viewed as lesions to RNA. These lesions might be important in the process of translation, in which RNA serves to direct the synthesis of proteins . For instance, it has been shown that in consequence of exchange of thiouracil for uracil in the anticodon loop of tRNA wrong amino acids are attached by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. 73

From Soup: 88 Sevilla et al. addressed a problem, 8 which set of atomic orbitals should be used in calculations of valence anions of polar molecules, such as uracil , which are characterized by negative values of electron vertical affinity, i.e. , the valence anion is unbound with respect to the neutral at the optimal geometry of the neutral, but which support dipole-bound anionic states. There is a dilemma what kind of the basis set should be used in calculations for the valence anionic state. On the one hand, it is known that extended basis sets supplemented with basis functions with small exponents are required to properly describe diffuse charge distributions of molecular anions. 74 On the other hand, optimization of the wave function for an unbound anion of a polar molecule might converge to a solution which is contaminated with a dipole-bound contribution if an extended basis set is used.

From Soup: 89 The problem of vertical electron attachment energies is simpler in the case of uracil or thymine than in the case of other NABs that do not have a symmetry plane. At the optimal geometry of neutral uracil , the wave function of valence anion with A″ symmetry does not mix with the wave function of dipole-bound state with A′ symmetry. The A″ state is, however, electronically unbound with respect to the neutral and there is an open issue whether conventional electronic structure methods can provide any meaningful value for the resonance position. Formally, with a basis set containing functions with small exponents, a wave function for the anion might converge to the wave function for the neutral supplemented with an additional p-symmetry orbital describing an excess electron distributed far away from the molecular core.

From Soup: 90 In Table 5 we present the values of VAE calculated with the AVDZ and AVDZ + diff basis sets at the RHF and coupled-cluster levels of theory. The smallest p-symmetry exponent in the AVDZ and AVDZ + diff basis set are 4.041(−2) and 2.2564(−4), respectively. Surprisingly, in the AVDZ + diff calculations there are no indications of the collapse of VAE to zero and the singly occupied orbital in the ROHF function is not dominated by contributions from basis functions with the smallest exponents. The CCSD(T) value of VAE, –0.57 eV, does not match, however, the resonance positions measured by Burrow et al. , 21 which are −0.22, −1.58, and −3.83 eV and were all assigned to π* antibonding states. Clearly, dealing with unbound valence anionic states is not straightforward when using conventional electronic structure methods.

The discrepancies in the values of VDE for a U val can obtained with the AVDZ and AVDZ + diff basis sets do not exceed 2 meV, see Table 4 . As we suggested in ref. 9 , it is usually safe to deal with these regions of the potential energy surface, in which the valence anion is vertically bound with respect to the neutral. In these regions, we recommended performing calculations with standard basis sets that contain basis functions with small exponents. As we are dealing with bound anionic states these basis functions might contribute to the proper description of the anionic charge distribution but do not lead to a collapse to a dipole-bound state, which is usually less strongly bound than the valence anionic state.

We prescreened 75 tautomers/rotamers of uracil at the B3LYP/6-31++G** level with an excess electron on a valence orbital. The four most stable valence anionic and neutral tautomers were further studied at the MP2/AVDZ level and final energies were determined at the coupled-cluster level to theory with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations.

The latter, a U val can , is adiabatically unbound with respect to nU can by 1.17 kcal mol −1 and it is characterized by a VDE of 506 meV. Another low-lying anionic tautomer with a carbon atom protonated, a U c5 n3 , is only 0.21 kcal mol −1 less stable than a U can and its VDE amounts to 2499 meV, which coincides with a maximum of the main feature of the recent photoelectron spectrum of U − . 29

Formation of the “very rare” anionic tautomers, such as a U c5 nl or a U c5 n3 , might proceed through intermolecular proton transfers, with acidic and basic sites interacting with a U val can . Another possibility is a two step process, with the dissociative electron attachment to n U can followed by a barrier-free attachment of a hydrogen atom to the C5 atom of uracil deprotonated at either the N1 or N3 position.
