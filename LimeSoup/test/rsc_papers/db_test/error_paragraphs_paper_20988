From cou.: 1 Carbon-centered radicals are interesting alternatives to otherwise commonly used nitroxide spin labels for dipolar spectroscopy techniques because of their narrow ESR linewidth. Herein, we present a novel BDPA biradical, where two BDPA (α,α,γ,γ-bisdiphenylene-β-phenylallyl) radicals are covalently tethered by a saturated biphenyl acetylene linker. The inter-spin distance between the two spin carrier fragments was measured using double quantum coherence (DQC) ESR methodology. The DQC experiment revealed a mean distance of only 1.8 nm between the two unpaired electron spins. This distance is shorter than the predictions based on a simple modelling of the biradical geometry with the electron spins located at the central carbon atoms. Therefore, DFT (density functional theory) calculations were performed to obtain a picture of the spin delocalization, which may give rise to a modified dipolar interaction tensor, and to find those conformations that correspond best to the experimentally observed inter-spin distance. Quantum chemical calculations showed that the attachment of the biphenyl acetylene linker at the second position of the fluorenyl ring of BDPA did not affect the spin population or geometry of the BDPA radical. Therefore, spin delocalization and geometry optimization of each BDPA moiety could be performed on the monomeric unit alone. The allylic dihedral angle θ1 between the fluorenyl rings in the monomer subunit was determined to be 30° or 150° using quantum chemical calculations. The proton hyperfine coupling constant calculated from both energy minima was in very good agreement with literature values. Based on the optimal monomer geometries and spin density distributions, the dipolar coupling interaction between both BDPA units could be calculated for several dimer geometries. It was shown that the rotation of the BDPA units around the linker axis (θ2) does not significantly influence the dipolar coupling strength when compared to the allylic dihedral angle θ1. A good agreement between the experimental and calculated dipolar coupling was found for θ1 = 30°.

From cou.: 2 Carbon-centered radicals have been known and well characterized for a long time (almost from 1800s).1 Recently, they have also gained interest as possible alternatives to nitroxide spin labels. Although nitroxides have gained immense interest due to their wide range of applications, ranging from material sciences2,3 to biological applications,4–8 some of their spectroscopic and chemical properties are not ideal. For example, nitroxides can be easily turned into diamagnetic species in the presence of reducing agents, limiting their use for in-cell applications. In addition, the large and strongly anisotropic nitrogen hyperfine coupling leads to a very short relaxation time at room temperature and a broad ESR line shape at low temperatures. This complicates the full saturation of the ESR line at room temperature by continuous-wave ESR and full excitation of the spin system by microwave pulses at low temperatures. In spite of ongoing efforts to further improve the performance of nitroxide radicals, carbon-based radicals have also recently been explored for ESR applications.

BDPA is well known as a persistent carbon centered radical.16,17 Its stability is due to a natural strong protection of the allyl moiety by a phenyl and two bulky fluorenyl rings.

From cou.: 5 The ESR and ENDOR spectra of BDPA have been observed and reported by several groups during the 60–70s.18–22 Hausser23 was the first to study spin delocalization in BDPA. He could resolve eight equivalent protons by their hyperfine coupling (HFC) of ∼2.2 G. Later, Watanabe and Yamauchi also proved by ENDOR spectroscopy that the unpaired electron, in addition to the allyl skeleton, spreads over the β-aryl group as well, although the magnitude of the spin density is very small.21,22

From cou.: 6 Only a few reports concerning the synthesis of BDPA derivatives are available. Kuhn reported halogenated BDPA derivatives and Breslin24 reported the synthesis of BDPA derivatives with methoxy-, cyano- and nitro-groups substituted at position 4 of the aryl ring. Previously synthesized biradicals containing BDPA have been limited to molecules containing two BDPA radicals linked through the phenyl ring. The reactivity of the BDPA radical complicates its incorporation into biradicals. Recently, successful attempts have been made to synthesize a BDPA-TEMPO biradical linked through an amide linkage25 for its use as a polarizing agent in dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments.26

From cou.: 7 Herein, for the first time, we report the synthesis and dipolar ESR spectroscopy of a BDPA biradical linked through a saturated biphenyl acetylene chain (C16H8) at the second position of the fluorenyl ring (cf.Fig. 1). When compared to the BDPA biradical, both nitroxides and TAMs have localized spin density. Therefore, a BDPA biradical is an interesting model system to challenge the point-dipole approximation27 due to its highly delocalized spin density over the whole BDPA moiety. The inter-spin distance of the two unpaired electron spins were measured using DQC spectroscopy. This experimentally observed distance distribution was then compared to quantum chemical calculations taking the spin density distribution and the conformation between both BDPA moieties explicitly into account. For this purpose, we have investigated, as a first step, the changes in the spin distribution of the BDPA monomer radical due to the attachment of the C16H8 saturated linker. Then, several BDPA biradical conformations were modelled using density functional theory (DFT). For such a molecular size, it is common to use molecular mechanics methods (MM) for geometry optimization. Herein, we conducted quantum mechanical calculations in order to address two questions in a more precise way: Which conformations are responsible for the experimentally observed inter-spin distance and what is the effect of the spin delocalization on the measured distance?

From cou.: 10 ESR measurements were carried out on a Bruker Elexsys E580 pulsed ESR spectrometer at 50 K. We used a fully over-coupled Bruker MS3 resonator in conjunction with a 1 kW TWT amplifier. The over-coupled MS3 resonator offers a 3 dB bandwidth of roughly 500 MHz, which exceeds the bandwidth of the pulses used herein, thus allowing one to neglect the pulse distortion by the resonator. The operating frequency was 9.5 GHz, which was also the frequency where the strongest B1 field was generated by the amplifier. The B0 field was set to 3387 G on-resonant with the BDPA ESR signal.

From cou.: 16 Initially, the calculations were conducted on a monomer radical unit to find a reliable model structure, which could reproduce the previously measured HFCs of BDPA with a reasonable precision and then used as the basis for further calculations. The optimized geometry, together with its nomenclature, is given in Fig. 1. The calculated structural parameters (bond lengths, angles and torsion angles) were compared to the structural parameters of crystallized BDPA in benzene, which were reported by Azuma et al.35,36 There is a reasonably good agreement between the crystal structure and the calculated geometry parameters. The calculated value of 34° for the torsion angle between the fluorenyl blades was close to the experimentally reported value ranging between 25° and 33°. Both, the calculated and the crystal structure show a slight deviation for the allyl moiety from planarity (3°–5°), reducing the repulsion between the two bulky fluorenyl groups. Subsequent frequency calculations showed that this structure has a real minimum on the potential energy surface and has no negative frequency. The smallest frequency was 23 cm−1 indicating the movements of the phenyl ring.

From cou.: 19 Herein, the different orientations of the two fluorenyl rings towards each other and their effect on the calculated HFCs were considered. Therefore, the dihedral angle θ1 (11, 22, 23, 24) was scanned from 0°–180° in 10° steps to find out which angle gave the optimum HFC value when compared to the experimental value of ∼2 G. Variation of HFCs and the relative energies as a result of the different positions of the two fluorenyl rings towards each other are shown in Fig. 4. The HFC variations are given for one of the protons at position 1 (cf.Fig. 1).

 ###### 
From cou.: 20 On investigating Fig. 4, it appears that the HFCs are very sensitive to the variation of θ1. Two minima can be found at 30° and 150° having nearly the same energy (energy difference between these conformers was ∼0.06 kcal mol−1) and with HFCs in good agreement with the experimental values (Table S2, ESI†). For these two conformers, the spin density was equally distributed over the two fluorenyl rings. A maximum energy conformer was obtained at 90° (the rotation barrier is ∼5.1 kcal mol−1) in which all the spin density was pushed towards one of the fluorenyl rings, which in turn gives rise to proton couplings up to ∼4 G in positions 1 and 3 (experimentally ∼2 G) and 1.2 G for positions 2 and 4 (experimentally ∼0.67 G), almost two times higher than the experimentally observed values in both cases.

From cou.: 22 After optimization of the BDPA monomer unit by adjustment of the dihedral angle θ1, we attached the biphenyl acetylene linker to the second position of the fluorenyl rings. For this purpose, different conformers were selected to be attached to the linker. Conformers with θ1 values of 30° and 150° were chosen due to their energetically favourable structures and close consistency of their HFC values to the experimental ones. The conformer with a θ1 value of 90° was taken as the case with the highest degree of HFC deviation and maximum energy, and finally two conformers with θ1 angles of 0° and 180° were chosen as the upper and lower rotational limit cases. All these structures were investigated both from their energetic and magnetic (HFCs) points of view. All conformers with the linker attached were optimized in solvent as before. The frequency and HFC calculations were conducted afterwards.

From cou.: 23 It has been shown that the spin density is spread out towards the other spin center27 along an unsaturated linker In such cases, taking the spin densities from the calculations of the individual and independent monomers will result in incorrect distances between both spin carrying moieties. Considering this fact, the quantum chemical calculations were precisely examined for changes in the spin density, singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO), HFCs and structural parameters due to the addition of the linker. We found that adding the linker had no significant effect on the structural parameters or on the spin densities. For all the studied conformers, the amount of spin density on the linker atoms was found to be zero (Table S3 and Fig. S1, ESI†). Frequency calculations on these structures indicated them as real minima. These data demonstrate that, in our case with a saturated linker, no spin density was exchanged between both BDPA units. In other words, we end up with two radical moieties, which do not influence each other's spin densities although they are connected via a linker. This is consistent with the cw-ESR measurements of the BDPA biradical, which did not show any HFC differences when compared to the mono-radical (data not shown). Therefore, the two linked BDPA units can be treated as separate and individual spin carrying units.

From cou.: 25 Using the optimized fragments, we were able to build several BDPA biradical geometries. The first rotational mode, described by the dihedral angel θ1, controls the position of the two fluorenyl rings towards each other, as described before. A second rotational freedom, defined by the dihedral angel θ2, generates cis/trans conformations of the two BDPA units with respect to each other (Fig. 5). A total of 30 different geometries were constructed (cis/trans conformers with 5 θ1 angles). For some of the model structures, the optimization failed to converge. We report the results from the 23 optimized structures.

From cou.: 26 Energy considerations for the optimized structures show that there is no significant difference between the cis and trans configurations (cf. Table S5, ESI†). This was not surprising since the two units are far apart from each other allowing probably a free rotation of the BDPA units around the linker. Only for the 150–150 θ1 combination was the trans conformation 5 kcal mol−1 higher in energy compared to its corresponding cis structure. Four of our constructed structures are energetically most favourable at 178 K (freezing point of toluene) according to Boltzmann statistics: 150–150 cis, 30–30 cis and trans and 30–150 cis (models 1 to 4). The 30–150 trans model was among those which failed to converge.

From cou.: 28 After optimization of the model structures, their Cartesian coordinates were taken for distance calculations. In the first attempt, the center to center distances (from C22 atom in unit 1 to C88 in unit 2) were considered (see Fig. 5). In this case all the energetically stable cis structures (models 1, 2 and 4) resulted in a distance between 2.06 and 2.1 nm, whereas the trans conformation (model 3) leaded to a slightly longer distance of 2.20 nm. This reflects that the distance between both centers does not depend on the angle θ1. As expected, the cis conformers have about 0.1 nm shorter distances for the center carbon atoms when compared to the trans conformers, but were still about 0.2 nm longer than the experimentally observed distance.

From Soup: 38 For all the geometries almost perfect axial tensors were obtained, as in the case of two localized electron spins, allowing to extract a distance from the coupling strength D . This was due to the fact that for all the geometries, the delocalization within both units was still smaller than the average distance between both moieties. The distances derived in this way for all the model structures are given in Table 1 for the cis conformers and in Table S4 (ESI † ) for all the trans conformers and compared with the experimental distance distribution obtained by Tikhonov regularization in Fig. 6 .

From Soup: 39 Having in mind that only four of our model structures are energetically favourable, in the following section we compare just the dipolar coupling strengths and distances derived from these four structures. It was found that the 30–30 conformers gave a larger dipolar coupling strength. This arises mostly from the large spin density on carbons 11 and 91 of the two fluorenyl rings, which are not directly connected to the linker (see Fig. 5 ) and are oriented in these conformers in such a way that their distance is minimized. This results in a shorter distance of about 0.1 nm when compared to the simplified model where all the spin density was localized on carbon atoms 22 and 88 described before. Therefore the orientation of these two fluorenyl rings, described by the angle θ 1 , have a similar strong effect on the dipolar coupling strength as one BDPA moiety rotates around the linker (described by the angle θ 1 ). The distances calculated from the distributed point dipole model for model structures 1 to 4 are depicted in Fig. 6 .

From Soup: 40 The experimental distance distribution width was rather well represented by the four model structures chosen. On the other hand, the mean distance was still somewhat larger in the simulations when compared to the experimental value, despite the fact that the spin density distribution lowered the calculated distance by about 0.1 nm for the 30–30 cis structure. Slightly shorter distances can be obtained by including the bending flexibility of the linker as observed for other biradical compounds. 38,39 On the other hand, this would account for much less than the 0.1 nm difference between the experimental results and model calculations. Moreover, no asymmetry in the distance distribution was visible excluding large bending motions. As examined, a small variation in the angle θ 1 to 20–20 further decreases the calculated distance of the cis structure to 1.87 nm, which was very close to the experimental maximum observed at 1.83 nm. Such an orientation of the fluorenyl rings will still be compatible with the experimental HFCs and energy considerations. In this study the solvent moiety was treated implicitly only. As the dipolar coupling strength depends strongly on the orientation of the fluorenyl rings, taking an explicit solvent approach, may account for such small discrepancies. Also, because of the small EPR linewidth and large dipolar coupling, the non-secular parts of the dipolar interaction might be the reason for the slight shift. 11 Therefore, we consider the agreement between the experimental distance distribution and the values extracted from quantum chemical calculations to be satisfactory. In our case, a combination of electronic and geometrical effects both contributed to the distance and distance distribution observed by the DQC ESR experiments. The spin delocalization onto the fluorenyl rings leads to stronger dipolar interactions for the 30–30 conformer and a more pronounced variation upon changing the angles θ 1 and θ 2 . Therefore, these results demonstrate the necessity to use more appropriate models for calculating the dipolar coupling strength or the respective distance.

From Soup: 41 A new BDPA model biradical was designed and synthesized. The dipolar coupling between both unpaired electron spins was measured using DQC ESR. The inter-spin distance obtained from the data by Tikhonov regularization was compared with predictions based on structure modelling. It was found that both electronic and geometrical effects had to be considered in order to satisfactorily explain the experimental distance distribution. Herein, the distributed point dipole approximation could be used for calculating the dipolar coupling because the linker lead to a good separation of the spin densities in both BDPA units, which was similar to previous findings. 27
