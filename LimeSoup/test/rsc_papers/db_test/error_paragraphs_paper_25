From Soup: 0 By combining mechanochemistry and co-crystals in a single theme issue, our aim was to highlight the natural connection between these two fast-growing topics, but also, if possible, to promote a broader cross-over of knowledge and understanding between them. Greater knowledge of co-crystals may inform mechanochemical processes in general, just as greater knowledge of mechanochemistry may inform the wider aspects of co-crystallisation.

From Soup: 1 We are delighted with the quality, insightfulness and originality of the articles which have been contributed. We are also especially pleased that their breadth reflects our original goal. The material included stretches from fundamental aspects of mechanochemistry, through mechanochemical covalent and co-crystal synthesis, to the detailed preparative, structural, thermodynamic and morphological aspects of co-crystals themselves.
