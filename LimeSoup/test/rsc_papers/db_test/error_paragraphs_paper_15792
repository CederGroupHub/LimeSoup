From cou.: 1 We studied in detail the electronic properties of C44H10F20N4 (tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin, hereafter H2TPP(F)) via a combined study by photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) and density functional (DF) calculations, shedding new light on the role of the halide in this very interesting molecule for organic electronics. Valence and core levels have been investigated by means of PES on H2TPP(F) thin films deposited on the SiO2/Si(100) native oxide surface by supersonic molecular beam deposition (SuMBD). These experiments have been carefully interpreted on the basis of DF results pertaining to the isolated H2TPP(F). Non-relativistic calculations have been run to investigate valence states, whereas a two component relativistic approach within the zeroth-order regular approximation has been adopted to study core levels. The present results, in conjunction with those obtained previously on the H2TPP parent compound [M. Nardi, R. Verucchi, C. Corradi, M. Pola, M. Casarin, A. Vittadini and S. Iannotta, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2010, 12, 871], pave the way towards designing fully organic p–n junctions by using these macrocycles.

From cou.: 2 π-Conjugated organic molecules are well known semiconducting materials, widely explored for thin film electronic and opto-electronic devices by exploiting their p-type carrier transport. Among them, porphyrins and their related derivatives have attracted a great deal of interest owing to their electronic and optical properties, which can be additionally tuned and enhanced through molecular engineering.1–3 In fact, their versatile aromatic structure makes this class of molecules particularly appealing for use in electronics,4 solar cells,5 biomedicine,6 and sensing,7 thus actually pushing towards the realization of a promising new generation of solid state devices. Several theoretical and experimental studies have been performed so far on free base porphyrins,8–12 as well as on molecules characterized by the presence of a metal center,13–16 also in the case of in vacuo synthesis of metal-porphyrins with the generation of exotic complexes useful for applications in electronics and optoelectronics.17,18 The switch of electronic transport properties from p- to n-type through the substitution of hydrogen terminated species with halogen species such as fluorine is an intriguing opportunity, pushing research activity towards the synthesis of organic systems showing both electron acceptor and donor characteristics and paving the way for the creation of a p–n junction fully based on organic materials. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the modified π-conjugated molecules, such as porphyrins,19–25 phthalocyanines and pentacenes,26 have been studied for application in a new class of dye-sensitized photovoltaic cells,27 sensing devices with improved sensitivity and selectivity,28,29 and high efficiency photosensitizers to be used in photodynamic therapy.30,31

From cou.: 3 The tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (C44H10F20N4; hereafter, H2TPP(F)) is commercially available and can be easily sublimed under vacuum, thus is a promising candidate for the creation of thin film based electronic devices, as many other porphyrins. It is worth noting that, despite these interesting properties, only a few scattered data are present in the literature,13,19,25,32 and a detailed description of its core levels (in particular the C 1s) and valence band states is still lacking.

From cou.: 4 In this work, the results of a combined experimental and theoretical study of the electronic properties of H2TPP(F) are presented and discussed. Surface photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) experiments have been performed to investigate both the valence band and the 1s core levels of C, N and F of H2TPP(F) thin films deposited using the so-called supersonic molecular beam deposition (SuMBD) technique.33,34 Experimental evidence will be discussed and rationalized by referring to the outcomes of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations carried out for the isolated H2TPP(F) molecule. Further insight into the role played by the halide in determining the electronic properties of the organic species has been then gained by comparing the H2TPP(F) data with homogeneous results recently published by some of us about the non-fluorinated (hereafter, H2TPP) species.10

From cou.: 5 The film deposition and in situ surface PES studies have been performed at the BEAR beamline,35,36 ELETTRA synchrotron radiation facility (Trieste, Italy). The SuMBD approach for thin film deposition is based on the use of supersonic molecular beams seeded by the organic precursor and has shown to induce and improve chemical reactivity, structural properties for several organic systems, with a high control on the film growth processes.37–39 The specific role of SuMBD in the present case of study is beyond the scope of this work and will be discussed elsewhere.40 The supersonic beam source,33,34 hosted in a specially designed vacuum chamber (base pressure 10−7 mbar), consists of a quartz tube with a nozzle (110 μm diameter) at its front end. By means of an external heater and electronic feedback from a thermocouple measuring the temperature, the organic molecules contained in the quartz tube are sublimated and their vapors seed the helium gas injected at high pressure inside the source. This helium–organic molecules gas mixture experiences a supersonic expansion under vacuum and a highly collimated molecular beam is formed through a skimmer. The aerodynamic acceleration of the heavier particles/aggregates in the generated molecular beam leads to kinetic energies as high as tens of eVs, with a substantial freezing of the internal degrees of freedom. The H2TPP(F) material has been supplied by Sigma Aldrich (a purity of 99.9%). The absence of contaminants in the organic supersonic molecular beam has been checked by Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (TOF-MS) performed using a different experimental set up at the IMEM-CNR Lab in Trento (Italy).37 The carrier gas was He at a pressure of 1200 mbar, while the source temperature was maintained at ∼285 °C. Under these operating conditions, the kinetic energy of the H2TPP(F) molecule is ∼25 eV, as evaluated by means of TOF-MS analysis. The SuMBD beam was normal to the substrate surface, held at room temperature. The organic molecular arrival rate on the substrate (∼1 Å min−1) has been estimated by means of quartz microbalance measurements. The substrate, obtained from a silicon wafer (n type, 0.01 Ω cm) with its own native oxide layer, has been cleaned by means of standard chemical treatments (sonication in acetone, isopropanol) and annealed under ultra high vacuum (UHV) up to 300 °C. The absence of any detectable contaminant was checked by PES.

From cou.: 6 Photon energy for the core level analysis was chosen in order to analyze electrons having always a kinetic energy of ∼100 eV and, consequently, the same escape depth of about 1–2 nm in the organic layer. Photons of 390/505/795 eV with a bandwidth smaller than 400/600/900 meV have been used for H2TPP(F) C 1s, N 1s, and F 1s, respectively, while 90 eV photons (bandwidth < 100 meV) have been employed to probe the valence band. PES signals have been detected by using a hemispherical electron energy analyzer with an energy resolution of 10 meV. The electron collection/photon beam incidence angles, with respect to the normal to the surface, were 0°/54.7°, respectively. The photon flux was about 1010 ph s−1, with a spot size of about 100 × 300 μm2. To evaluate the possible presence of charging or molecule damage due to the radiation, we monitored the C 1s core level and valence band characteristics under several experimental conditions and for long acquisition periods. No significant evolution of C 1s and valence band lineshape has been observed, also at higher photon flux, higher film thickness, longer acquisition time than those used for the shown PES data. Valence band in situ analysis has also been performed using a different UHV experimental apparatus at the IMEM-CNR laboratory,18 using a He discharge lamp and an electron energy analyzer leading to a final energy resolution of ∼100 meV. Binding energies (BEs) of core levels and valence bands have been estimated by taking as reference the 4f7/2 Au level (84.00 eV) and the Au Fermi edge, respectively, obtained from a sputter cleaned Au surface. The core level analysis has been carried out by adopting the Voigt lineshape deconvolution, after background subtraction by a Shirley function. Typical uncertainty for the energy positioning amounts to ±0.05 eV, while for the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and for the area evaluation it is less than ±5% and ±2.5%, respectively. The atomic contribution of each single chemical species, giving an origin to a specific photoemission peak, can be estimated within an error of ±1 atom.

From cou.: 7 DFT numerical experiments have been carried out by using the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) package.41 The geometry of H2TPP(F) has been optimized by running non-relativistic (NR) calculations with generalized gradient corrections self-consistently included through the Becke–Perdew formula.42 An idealized D2h symmetry has been assumed, as suggested by previous studies carried out on H2TPP10 whose optimized dihedral angle between the pristine porphyrin macrocycle and phenyl rings was computed very close to 90°. To allow the comparison between totally homogeneous theoretical results, a further series of ADF numerical experiments pertaining to H2TPP have been carried out by reoptimizing its geometry in a D2h symmetry. Nevertheless, H2TPP geometrical parameters and binding energy undergo negligible differences on passing from C2v10 to D2h symmetry, thus they will not be presented here and results in ref. 10 will be taken as reference. A TZP Slater-type basis set has been adopted for all the atoms; moreover, the F 1s, N 1s, and C 1s cores have been kept frozen throughout the calculations in a fully occupied configuration, and excluded from the variational space.

From Soup: 22 H 2 TPP(F) is characterized by four completely fluorinated phenyl rings connected to the C(5), C(10), C(15), and C(20) meso carbon atoms of the pristine porphyrin macrocycle . Despite the bond delocalization of these macrocycles ( porphyrins are aromatic on the basis of Hückel's rule), different chemical species can be identified in the molecule (see Fig. 1 where the recommended IUPAC numbering system 48 has been adopted): (i) the pyrrolic nitrogen atoms , namely N(21) and N(23); (ii) the azanitrogen atoms, N(22) and N(24), both of them carrying a lone pair in the molecular σ h plane ( n N ); (iii) the twenty four phenyl carbon atoms (C Ph ), twenty of which are fluorine-saturated (C F Ph ); (iv) the four (C m ) meso carbon atoms, C(5), C(10), C(15), and C(20); (v) the twenty fluorine atoms decorating the four C m bonded phenyl rings. Different species of carbons may also be recognized in the nonequivalent pyrrole rings; i.e. , those occupying the so-called β (2–3; 7–8; 12–13; 17–18) and α (1–4; 6–9; 11–14; 16–19) positions, and hereafter collectively tagged C Py .

From Soup: 23 PES measurements have been achieved on a ∼40 nm H 2 TPP(F) film (as checked by AFM analysis), which is thick enough to avoid any contribution to the spectra from electrons photoemitted at the organic/inorganic interface (no substrate photoemission signal has been indeed detected). Thin film atomic percentages of C, F, and N have been estimated from the corresponding C 1s, N 1s, and F 1s core levels by means of the sensitivity factors method 49 coupled with the Yeh and Lindau photoionization cross sections. 50 The resulting values are 62.9%, 32.4%, and 4.7% for C, F and N, respectively, in agreement with the expected ones (64.7%, 29.4%, and 5.9%, respectively) and within the typical errors of PES analysis (±2.5%). This suggests the absence of any damage of the molecular film related to the SuMBD or to the photon beam irradiation.

From Soup: 24 The valence band states of the H 2 TPP(F) film have been investigated by using 21.2 and 90.0 eV excitation photon energies (in different experimental setups). The corresponding raw spectra (see Fig. 2 , right panel) consist of the same main features with some differences in their relative intensities, the origin of which will be discussed later. Two peaks are present at 2.5 and 4.7 eV, while other structures can be identified at about 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, 11, and 13 eV. The first peak at 2.5 eV can be straightforwardly labeled the highest occupied MO (HOMO), while the band at 11 eV can be confidently correlated with the photoemission from F 2p states. 51 The UPS spectrum secondary electron cutoff (SECO) shows a −0.7 eV shift (in BE) for the film with respect to the substrate ( Fig. 2 , left panel), thus suggesting the presence of dipoles at the H 2 TPP(F)/SiO 2 interface. 52,53 Since such a shift has not been observed for the H 2 TPP–SiO 2 system, 10 a +0.7 eV BE compensation must be taken into account when comparing either IEs of the two molecules or H 2 TPP(F) DOS/PDOS with the corresponding experimental outcomes. Before going on, it is of relevance to stress that similar negative shifts have been already observed for thin films of fluorinated phthalocyanines deposited on metals 54 or silicon based materials, 55,56 and are related to Fermi level alignment with possible charge transfer at the organic/inorganic interface. 52,53

From Soup: 25 The H 2 TPP(F) lowest IE has been evaluated from experimental valence band data as the difference between the photon energy and the spectrum energy length. The resulting value of 7.0 ± 0.1 eV agrees well with other studies 9,57 and with the H 2 TPP(F) 18b 1u HOMO TS calculation (7.36 eV). In this regard, it is also worth noting the fair agreement between the experimental and theoretical IE HOMO blue shifts (0.8 and 1.0 eV, respectively) 58 induced by the presence of the fluorine atoms 3,32 on passing from H 2 TPP to H 2 TPP(F).

From Soup: 26 The energy positions of the two lowest lying features characterizing the PES spectra of H 2 TPP and H 2 TPP(F) are rather similar, 10 as a consequence of the formation of the observed dipole at the organic/inorganic film interface. 54 However, the density of states distribution in the 5–12 eV BE range shows different features, only partially related to the F 2p photoemission peak at BE = 11 eV, obviously absent in the H 2 TPP case. These results are crucial for the application of H 2 TPP(F) in electronics and optoelectronics, when specific band alignments between occupied and unoccupied levels are required. In fact, the achievement of n-type transport properties by using halogenated porphyrins instead of the hydrogen terminated species could lead to unpredictable and also unfavorable results, as observed for luminescence in erbium porphyrins. 23 In the present case, thick films of H 2 TPP and H 2 TPP(F) on SiO 2 show the same HOMO energy position, despite the different IEs, while the formation of dipole or possible charge transfer at the interface could influence the properties of electronic devices based on the fluorinated molecule.

These results are crucial for the application of H2TPP(F) in electronics and optoelectronics, when specific band alignments between occupied and unoccupied levels are required. In fact, the achievement of n-type transport properties by using halogenated porphyrins instead of the hydrogen terminated species could lead to unpredictable and also unfavorable results, as observed for luminescence in erbium porphyrins.23 In the present case, thick films of H2TPP and H2TPP(F) on SiO2 show the same HOMO energy position, despite the different IEs, while the formation of dipole or possible charge transfer at the interface could influence the properties of electronic devices based on the fluorinated molecule.
From Soup: 27 The energy region corresponding to frontier MOs of porphyrins and phthalocyanines is usually depicted as a superposition of benzene and pyrrole MOs. Based on this fact, bands lying between 7 and 16 eV are ascribed to C Ph /C Py based π and σ orbitals as well as to the in-phase and out-of-phase linear combinations of n N ( n N + and n N − , respectively). 9,10,59,60 H 2 TPP(F) DOS/PDOS are displayed in Fig. 3 where relevant features have been alphabetically labeled. The comparison with H 2 TPP results 10 testifies that features B, C, and D are uniformly blue shifted (∼1.0 eV) upon the F decoration of phenyl rings while, besides the different shape of the A feature in the two molecules, its blue shift is significantly smaller (∼0.7 eV). Keeping in mind the major contribution of C Ph (H 2 TPP) and C F Ph (H 2 TPP(F)) based π MOs to A, such a result is only apparently counterintuitive. In fact, the actual energy position of C F Ph based π levels is determined by two opposite effects: (i) the electron withdrawing properties of fluorine and (ii) the extensive mixing between C F Ph and F p π occupied orbitals. With specific reference to the latter effect, bonding and antibonding combinations are generated, the former mainly localized on F, the latter strongly concentrated on C F Ph (see Fig. 4 ). The comparison with the experimental results for H 2 TPP(F) shows a fair correspondence for the A and B bands with peaks located at 4.7 and 2.5 eV, with an uncertainty of a few tens of eVs due to their broadening.

From Soup: 28 GS NR ADF outcomes suggest us to associate the lowest lying peak of the H 2 TPP(F) valence band spectra with the ionization from the quasi degenerate 18b 1u and 15a u MOs (see Fig. 5 ), reminiscent of the free base porphyrin a 1u and a 2u HOMOs. More difficult is the assignment of the spectral feature at ∼4.7 eV whose FWHM amounts to ∼1.0 eV. Theoretical results indicate that, beyond the 18b 1u and 15a u HOMOs, the 6.5/8.0 eV energy region, corresponding to band A and its shoulder A′ (see Fig. 3 ) includes 16 MOs accounting for: (i) n N + and n N − (29a g and 27b 3u MOs, respectively); (ii) a former set of four quasi degenerate F–C F Ph antibonding π orbitals (14a u , 16b 1u , 15b 2g , and 16b 3g MO S ) having one of their two nodal planes coincident with σ h ; (iii) the latter set of four F–C F Ph antibonding π orbitals (25b 1g , 26b 3u , 27b 2u , and 28a g MOs) having both nodal planes perpendicular to σ h and mixing , to some extent, with C Py σ orbitals; (iv) the in-phase (17b 1u MO) and out-of-phase (16b 2g MO) linear combinations of C B Py and C D Py based π orbitals; (v) the in-phase (15b 1u MO) and out-of-phase (15b 3g MO) linear combinations of C A Py and C C Py based π orbitals; (vi) the 14b 2g and 14b 3g π orbitals, both accounting for a delocalized (localized) C m –C β –C α (C β –C β ) bond involving the A and C (B and D) pyrrole rings in the former case and the B and D (A and C) pyrrole rings in the latter.

From Soup: 29 In order to favor the comparison between H 2 TPP(F) theoretical outcomes and the corresponding valence band spectra recorded at 21.2 and 90.0 eV excitation photon energies, we adopted the same approach in ref. 61 . More specifically, F 2p, N 2p, and C 2p PDOS have been multiplied by the relative atomic subshell photoionization cross sections at 21.2 and 80.0 eV photon energies reported in ref. 50 and then added all together to obtain a 2p PDOS (see Fig. 6 ) where photoionization cross sections are somehow taken into account. 62 The role of fluorine in changing the relative intensities of the different features is evident, in particular for the A band that is indeed enhanced in the experimental valence band at the higher photon energy (see Fig. 2 ). Thus, the origin of the observed differences in the two experimental valence bands can be confidently ascribed to variation of the excitation cross section of the molecular states.

From Soup: 30 Experimental results pertaining to the H 2 TPP(F) N 1s core level are displayed in Fig. 7 (upper panel). The spectrum is characterized by two main peaks, while a less intense feature on the higher BE side is evident. The Voigt lineshape analysis (see Table 1 ) reveals the presence of two main peaks, N b and N a , lying at 399.00 and 400.90 eV, respectively, with two broader components, N sat b and N sat a , at 401.80 eV and 403.70 eV, respectively. The relative weights of the total N 1s signal are 46.7% (N a ), 44.9% (N b ) and 4.2% for both N sat a and N sat b . The assignment of the H 2 TPP(F) N 1s spectrum may obviously take advantage of the chemical difference between pyrrolic (N(21)/N(23)) and aza nitrogen (N(22)/N(24)) atoms determining two peaks of similar intensity and width, i.e. N a and N b , respectively. 8,10,13,15,63 The energy position of the two main components is in good agreement with other studies, 13 while N sat a has been previously attributed to a shake-up satellite of the N a peak due to a π–π* resonant electron promotion process. 8,13,63 The presence of a second satellite, ascribable to the N b parent peak, has been identified in our previous studies of the H 2 TPP molecule. 10 Similar results are found here, with the N sat b feature showing the same characteristics (intensity, width and distance from the parent structure, as shown in Table 1 ) of N sat a . Based on such evidence, we associated unambiguously the N sat b feature with a π–π* resonant electron promotion process related to the N b peak. It is worthwhile to remind that literature results, missing the N sat b feature, 8,13,15 reported N 1s main peaks having markedly different area, contrary to our result and from what expected in tetraphenylporphyrin .

From Soup: 31 As shown in Fig. 8 (upper panel), the numerical agreement between experiment and relativistic ZORA calculations is satisfactory. In more detail, the N b and N a peaks derive from the ionization of the accidentally degenerate in-phase and out-of-phase linear combinations of N 1s aza and N 1s Py (403.89 and 405.62 eV, respectively); in fact, both the energy difference (1.73 eV) and the blue shift upon fluorination (1.21 eV) of these levels reasonably reproduce experimental evidence (1.9 and 1.5 eV, respectively, with the +0.7 eV BE compensation for the dipole presence). The comparison with H 2 TPP results confirm a strictly similar energy difference between the two N 1s main levels. 10 As a whole, the N 1s emission lineshape is rather well reproduced by the DFT-ZORA calculations, obviously disregarding the presence of the two satellites.

From Soup: 32 Considering the whole picture, the close similarities between the H 2 TPP(F) and H 2 TPP N 1s experimental and numerical results suggest that pyrrolic and aza nitrogen species are only weakly affected by the presence of the F atoms decorating the four phenyl rings bonded to C m . In particular, despite the observed blue shift from H 2 TPP 10 of the N 1s core level photoemission of H 2 TPP(F), neither the ΔBE between N a 1s and N b 1s, nor the ΔBE between N 1s and the corresponding satellite (2.80 eV) change on passing from H 2 TPP to H 2 TPP(F). 10

From Soup: 33 The analysis of the C 1s core level reveals a complex lineshape (see Fig. 7 , lower panel), with the presence of two main bands at ∼287 and 289 eV. As far as the former wider structure is concerned, it can be reasonably deconvolved in four features alphabetically labeled (C a , C b , C c , and C d ), while the latter is properly represented by the single peak C e . Each feature's FWHM and intensity (see Table 1 ) suggest strong similarities between C a and C b (lying at 285.80 and 286.30 eV, respectively), as well as between C c and C d (286.80 and 287.50 eV, respectively). The C e component (289.60 eV) represents the main peak with a 53% percentage of the total C 1s emission area. If we estimate the number of carbon units generating photoemission peaks by analyzing the corresponding weights of the C 1s area, C a and C b components are equivalent to ∼3.5 atoms, C c and C d to 6.5 atoms, C e to 23 atoms. A further weak component corresponding to the photoemission from ∼1 atom lies at 292.75 eV and has been labeled C sat .

From Soup: 34 The comparison of H 2 TPP(F) C 1s data with those pertaining to H 2 TPP 10 confirms that, as already observed for the N 1s photoemission spectrum , fluorine atoms generate a significant C 1s BE blue shift. Nevertheless, the entanglements of the H 2 TPP(F) C 1s photoemission spectrum make any reliable experimental evaluation of such a shift as difficult as the possibility of associating components with specific carbon species via a deconvolution procedure. A significant exception is the C e component at 289.60 eV that we assign undoubtedly to the photoemission from C F Ph C 1s core levels. 13 We emphasize that both its intensity of ∼23 atoms, significantly higher than the expected value of 20, and its larger FWHM (1.17 eV) with respect to all other components, suggest that fluorine plays an important role in defining the chemical properties of these carbon atoms with respect to all others.

From Soup: 35 As far as the weak C s peak is concerned, its very high BE (292.75 eV) corresponds to the C 1s level of carbon atoms doubly or triply bonded to halides . 64 On the other hand, as it has been already mentioned, the H 2 TPP(F) compositional results are consistent with the absence of any molecule degradation induced by the deposition technique or PES measurements. Thus, the origin of C sat has to be traced back to a shake-up process of photoelectrons generated from one (or more) carbon species, whose identification is prevented by their large number.

From Soup: 37 Once again, DFT-ZORA outcomes ( Fig. 8 , lower panel) provide useful information: the C x components ( x = a, b, c, d, and e) of the wide structure at ∼287 eV in the H 2 TPP(F) C 1s photoemission spectrum can be in fact associated with specific carbon species, explaining also the C x relative intensities. Moreover, the C 1s BE blue shift can be better estimated for each carbon species on going from H 2 TPP to H 2 TPP(F), also in comparison with the experimental values by either considering (+0.7 eV BE) or neglecting the dipole presence. In fact, a careful analysis of Fig. 8 (lower panel) coupled with data reported in Table 1 gives some interesting information: (i) IEs of C F Ph C 1s levels give rise to a quite narrow band centered at 294.14 eV and blue shifted by 4.24 eV with respect to the H 2 TPP C Ph C 1s levels (the experimental blue shift including or not the dipole presence amounts to 4.75/4.05 eV); (ii) the blue shift induced by the fluorination is reduced to 2.38 eV for C Ph directly bonded to C m (2.65/1.95 from experimental analysis); 65 (iii) pyrrole rings B and D (A and C) generate two bands at 290.66 (291.08) and 291.77 (292.28) eV, the former due to C β B–D (C β A–C ), the latter due to C α B–D (C α A–C ); 66 (iv) the C 1s IE of C m H 2 TPP(F) exactly matches the C α B–D one with a blue shift induced by the fluorine decoration amounting to 1.47 eV (an experimental corresponding shift of 1.55/0.85 eV). Despite the systematic overestimation of ∼5 eV in the evaluation of C x IE absolute values, the agreement between theory and experiment is very good when relative C x IEs are considered (see Table 1 ).

From Soup: 38 Analogous considerations hold when the F 1s core level photoemission spectrum is taken into account (see Fig. 9 , upper panel). The experimental pattern consists of a single main feature F a located at 689.60 eV, having a FWHM larger than the C 1s and N 1s single components, a consequence of the corresponding increased bandwidth of the exciting photon . The absence of other peaks testifies the presence of a single chemical species associated with fluorine, as expected for H 2 TPP(F), despite the different location of fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring. Once again, the agreement between experiment and the outcomes of DFT-ZORA calculations is outstanding (see Fig. 9 , lower panel): H 2 TPP(F) F 1s IEs generate a single narrow peak at 690.05 eV.

From Soup: 40 The study of the H 2 TPP(F) valence band combined with NR DFT has allowed us to obtain information about the nature and the energy of H 2 TPP(F) frontier MOs. In particular, the two bands at lowest BEs reveal contribution from many MOs, belonging to most of the chemical species in the molecule. We have shown the presence of a −0.7 eV dipole at the H 2 TPP(F)/SiO 2 interface, not present for H 2 TPP, which induces a significant BE negative shift of all energy levels. The numerical results for 2p PDOS, calculated taking into account the role of single atomic photoionization cross section, have clearly explained the role of fluorine in determining the valence band lineshape at the different photon energies. From the point of view of the core level spectra , a significant blue shift of N 1s and C 1s has been found, with a good agreement between experiments (about +1.5 eV) and calculations (+1.21 eV). Results for N 1s can be considered analogous to those for H 2 TPP, 10 suggesting that the macrocycle electronic properties are weakly affected by fluorine. The deconvolution of the complex C 1s experimental spectrum has been successfully achieved by the relativistic two-component ZORA calculations, allowing the correct identification of all carbon chemical species present in the molecule. In the case of the C 1s core level, fluorine presence reflects in a higher BE of all phenyl carbon atoms, while other species located in the molecule macrocycle do not show relevant differences on going from H 2 TPP to H 2 TPP(F). The F 1s core level is characterized by a single chemical species.

From Soup: 41 The H 2 TPP(F) molecule represents a promising route toward achieving n-type transport properties, thanks to its high IE that can improve the electron promotion to molecular lowest unoccupied MO (LUMO) from the metal Fermi level, the semiconductor valence band or from HOMO of different organic species. However, the alignment of the Fermi level at the interface plays an important role in determining the efficiency of n-type transport, and the possibility of charge transfer must be correctly approached. The detailed description of the H 2 TPP(F) electronic properties will allow the interpretation of these chemical processes by PES analysis, also in the case of strong chemical interaction. The use of H 2 TPP(F) and H 2 TPP in electronic devices based on this heterojunction can be taken into account, even if they show an HOMO alignment when deposited on SiO 2 that would reduce the possibility of electron transport from the HOMO of the non-fluorinated molecule to the LUMO of H 2 TPP(F). This will further help in defining the strategies to use these fluorinated species in devices where n-type transport properties and/or electron-donor behavior are envisaged, fully exploiting their potentialities.
