From cou.: 1 To further extend the EEM approach to improve its accuracy, a new approach, in which the different connectivities and hybridized states are introduced to represent the different chemical environments, has been developed. The C, O and N atoms are distinguished between different hybridized states. Different states of hydrogen atoms are defined according to their different connectivities. Furthermore, the sp2 carbons in the aromatic rings are also separated from the other sp2 carbons. Geometries and NPA charges are calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G* level, and the effective electronegativity and hardness values could be calibrated with the help of a training set of 141 organic molecules using the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. The quality of the modified EEM charges is evaluated by comparison with the B3LYP/6-31G* charges calculated for a series of polypeptides, not contained in the training set. For further comparison, the atomic parameters of the original EEM without including chemical environments are recalibrated under the same conditions. It is found that the accuracy of the modified EEM method improves significantly as compared to that of the original EEM method.

From cou.: 3 In general, the most commonly used approach for calculation of atomic charges is the ab initio molecular orbital method. However, this method becomes difficult and time-consuming when dealing with large molecules such as polypeptides or proteins. Therefore, an alternative approach for calculation of atomic charges accurately and economically is desirable. The electronegativity equalization method (EEM) based on DFT10–12 is such an approach that allows fast calculation of atomic charges in large molecules.

From cou.: 4 In this field, a remarkable work is the electronegativity equalization method (EEM) developed by Mortier13et al., which is built on the earlier work of Sanderson,14,15 Pauling, Parr,16,17 Mulliken and others. Later on, in order to improve the accuracy of the EEM, several related approaches have been proposed. Rappé and Goddard18 developed the charge equilibration approach (QEq), which was further developed by Louwen and Vogt19 through introducing an empirical Coulombic interaction function. Njo et al.20 extended and simplified the EEM with a shielding of external potential. To include the bond nature, the atom-bond electronegativity equalization method (ABEEM),21–23 developed by Yang et al., has been successfully applied to predict the atomic charge distribution for large organic molecules in aqueous solution, even metallobiomolecules.24 However, one may argue that it was not accurate for substituting the different semi-empirical approximations for the external potential term in the approach. Moreover, the effect of chemical environments was not considered sufficiently, although they led to some improvements, as compared to the previous EEM13 results.

From cou.: 5 Recently, Bultinck et al.25–27 have validated and optimized the EEM method without involving any empirical approximations including C, H, O, N, and F, each element with the same parameters. However, atomic charges in molecules are connectivity and geometry-dependent.27,28–32. The same element with different environments should correspond to different parameters, although satisfying results can be obtained for some systems. Van Duin et al.33 also made a distinction between sp2 and sp carbon hybridized states in the force field. In addition, Svobodová Vařekováet al.34 created the EEM SOLVER and ABEEM SOLVER programs to improve the efficiency of EEM and ABEEM, while the accuracy did not improve at all.

From cou.: 6 To further improve the accuracy of the EEM method, a modified EEM, in which the different connectivities, hybridization states, and aromatic environments to help to represent the different chemical surroundings, has been proposed in this study for fast calculation of atomic charges for large biological molecules. In this work, the differential evolution (DE) algorithm is employed to globally optimize and calibrate the parameters of the modified EEM for NPA charges including C, H, O, N, and F atoms through a training set of 141 organic molecules. It should be noted that no empirical approximation is made concerning the external potential term and no restriction is imposed on any of the calibrated parameters in the calibration.

From cou.: 7 The electronegativity equalization principle, proposed by Sanderson,14,15 stated that the effective electronegativity (χi) for every atom is equal to the molecular electronegativity χeq:The effective electronegativity of the ith atom in the molecule can be obtained by eqn (2):where N is the number of atoms in the molecule, qi and qj are the net charges distributed on the atoms i and j, respectively, Rij represents the interatomic distance between atoms i and j. The χ*i and η*i, which are the effective atomic electronegativity and hardness of ith atom in the molecule, respectively, are defined by eqn (3).Where χ0i and η0i describe the electronegativity and hardness of an isolated neutral atom, Δχi and Δηi are the molecular environments around the atom. In addition, the total charge Q of the molecule is equal to the sum of all the atomic chargesFor an arbitrary molecule with N number atoms, one has (N + 1) unknown quantities (N-atomic charges of qi and one value of χeq), when eqn (1) is applied to each atom, it can simultaneously yield N linear equations. These equations along with eqn (4) can be combined into N + 1 linear equations, which can be expressed in matrix form as:From eqn (5), it is clear that when the parameters χ*i and η*i are known, the above matrix algebra can be used for calculation of atomic charges at high speed.

From cou.: 8 In the chemical intuition, the more sufficient chemical environments (e.g. connectivity or geometry) are included for a specific element in the calibration, the closer the calibrated parameters will approximate the reality. However, adding more parameters will result in more variables to be optimized, and the increase of the dimensionality might lead to a multiple-minimum problem in finding the best set of optimized parameters. Therefore, there is a balance between the number of classified atom types including different chemical environments and the limitation of the number of variables involved in the optimization.

From cou.: 9 The calibration set consists of 141 molecules containing C, H, O, N, and F, among which 17 molecules contain the F atom (listed in Table 2 of the ESI†). The total 13 sets of effective electronegativity and hardness parameters of atom types involved C, O, H, N, and F are optimized and calibrated as follows: C, N, and O are distinguished between different hybridized states, and hydrogen is divided into three different atom types according to its connectivities to C, N, and O, respectively. Besides, the carbons in the aromatic ring are also separated from the sp2 hybridized states due to their aromaticity. Only the F atom still keeps one atom type in the calibration.

Afterwards, Bultinck et al.25–27 extended its applications to C, H, O, N, and F elements in a simplex method and a genetic algorithm, in which the effective atomic electronegativity of H was adjusted to 1.0 eV in the parameter optimization.

From cou.: 12 In the present study, the differential evolution (DE) algorithm was applied to perform optimization, and no restrictions were imposed on any of the parameters. Instead of using the same parameters for the same element, there are 4, 3, 2, and 3 different sets of effective electronegativity and hardness values for C, H, O, N elements, respectively, and only the fluorine remains the one atom type, leading to a set of 26 parameters in the optimization.

From Soup: 29 With the increase of variables, the quality of predicted charges is highly sensitive to the optimized parameters, which is influenced greatly by the optimization method. Therefore, the choice of the optimization method, which is suitable for the characteristic of corresponding objective functions, becomes extremely important in the calibration. However, this key step is usually ignored in optimization. Generally speaking, the efficient optimization technique should fulfil the following three requirements. First, the method should locate the true global minimum, regardless of the initial system parameter values. Second, convergence should be fast. Finally, the program should have a minimum of controllable parameters so that it will be easy to use. The DE algorithm, 35 which proved to be a powerful method for minimizing nonlinear and non-differentiable continual space functions, has been employed to this study.

From Soup: 32 The different hybridized states of the same element correspond to different chemical surroundings, and thus carry different charges. 28 To investigate whether the atomic charge distribution is affected by the states of hybridization, the parameters of C, O and N are separately optimized according to different hybridized states with a large training set of 124 molecules, and the results are shown in Table 1 . It should be noted that the training set of 124 molecules, not containing F atom, are derived from the total 141 molecules. It can be seen, from Table 1 , that the overall trend of calibrated effective electronegativity χ * is consistent with the chemical intuition: χ O * > χ N * > χ C * > χ H *. For comparison, the parameters, without including hybridization for C, H, O, and N, are also calibrated under the same conditions. Table 4 shows the comparison of results obtained from the original and the EEM method including hybridization for calculated EEM charges of several test molecules. Good agreement between the EEM charges including hybridization and DFT charges, is seen, better than that of original EEM method. This demonstrates that atomic charge distribution is really influenced by the hybridized states of atoms.

From Soup: 33 To further evaluate the effect of the connectivity, an example of glycine , of which the geometry is optimized by the B3LYP/6-31G* method, is shown in Fig. 1 . It is evident that the same element attached to different atoms has different NPA charges. Moreover, there are large differences among them. Especially for the hydrogen, the charge attached to C is 0.254, but those connected to N and O are about 0.381 and 0.496, respectively. Similar instances occur in the other training set of molecules. This is mainly attributed to the fact that there are large discrepancies of electronegativity between hydrogen and other neutral atoms, such as C, N, and O, especially when its connected elements are more electronegative. It is worth noting that the same training set and optimized method are used for considering hybridization in the calibration.

The correlation results of atomic charges, obtained from the original EEM method and the method containing connectivity, with DFT charges for several test molecules, respectively, are shown in Table 4 . From Table 4 , it is evident that the predicted results obtained by the method including connectivity are in good agreement with DFT charges, better than those of the EEM method containing hybridization, and much better than those of the original EEM method. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the results obtained from the EEM method including connectivity decrease largely, compared to those of the original EEM method, especially for the compound alanine dipeptide , which is nearly one-half of the original RMSE, dropping from 0.09765 to 0.0405. This demonstrates the connectivity dependence of the atomic charges.

From Soup: 35 From the above mentioned, it can be found that it is necessary to introduce the hybridization and connectivity to represent the effect of the chemical environments in the EEM calibration. On the other hand, the agreement between the EEM charges including connectivity and DFT charges is better than the results of the EEM method considering hybridization, which indicates the connectivity seems more important than hybridization for calibration of parameters. It should be pointed out here that the factors of connectivity and hybridization might be correlated with each other, which is crucial when making a distinction between different atom types.

From Soup: 37 Since the net atomic charge approximation model is employed in this method, the nuclear can be regarded as surrounded by the atomic charges. However, because the charge density for each atom is not spherical symmetry for the conjugated systems, it is not suitable for the nuclear-centered model. This limitation enables us only to make a distinction between the carbon atoms in the aromatic ring and the other sp 2 carbon atoms, although they belong to the sp 2 -hybridized states and have a little differences in charge between them. In this work, the carbon atoms in the benzene are distinguished from other sp 2 carbon atoms.

From Soup: 40 In this study, the efficiency of three different optimized algorithms, including Accelerated Random Search algorithms (ARS), 38 Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms 39 and Differential Evolution algorithms (DE), are compared with each other through optimization of the objective function ( 6 ), respectively, and the results are shown in Fig. 2 . It is obvious that the DE algorithm converges much faster, and after 10 000 iterations, the achieved minimum value is much smaller compared to those of PSO and ARS algorithms (the minimum values for PSO, ARS, and DE are 0.287, 0.035, and 0.011, respectively), although it cannot be determined whether the minimum objective function value obtained by DE algorithms is the global minimum. This may be mainly due to the high sensitivity of the fitness function with respect to the calibrated parameters and it is more likely to end up in local minima. However, it can be assured that the global minimum value is remarkably easy to obtain for DE algorithms. At least for the objection function ( 6 ) in this study, the DE algorithm is regarded as the best choice compared to other algorithms.

From Soup: 43 It can be drawn from the above that, the major factors influencing the atomic charge distribution should be taken into account completely. In addition, the choice of the optimized method is also one of the most important steps in the calibration. Although the chemical environments included in this work are not the completely geometric factors that influence the atomic charges in a molecule, other factors such as bond distances, bond angles, torsional angles, etc ., are correlated with hybridization states or connectivity, respectively. 40 Moreover, they, in practice, have relative smaller effects on the charge distribution, compared to those of hybridized states and connectivity. So they are not considered in the present work. In addition, the choice of the basis sets has little effect on the NPA charge distributions. Furthermore, the atomic charges from a different choice of basis sets have a similar trend and correlate to each other nearly linearly. 24 A different training set has a somewhat different effect on the parameters, but the effect is very limited if the training set contains a sufficient number of training molecules and atom types.

From Soup: 44 Table 5 shows the calibrated parameters of effective electronegativity and hardness parameters for different atom types of C, H, O, N, and F. It is seen, from Table 5 , that the sequence of calibration effective electronegativity parameters χ * is reasonable ( χ H * < χ C * < χ N * < χ O * < χ F *), and the calibrated electronegativity value of carbons in the benzene is close to the parameters of sp 2 -hybridized carbon. This illustrates again that carbons in the benzene have similar effective electronegativity parameters as other sp 2 -hybridized carbons, although there are some differences in chemical environments.

This illustrates again that carbons in the benzene have similar effective electronegativity parameters as other sp2-hybridized carbons, although there are some differences in chemical environments.
From Soup: 45 Table 5 also gives the calibrated parameters for the hardness. An interesting phenomenon can be seen, for the atom types involving O, N, and F, that the more electronegativity the atom type has, the larger the effective hardness will be. For example, the present calibration gives a lower effective electronegativity and hardness values for three atom types of nitrogen compared to those of two types of oxygen. This can be interpreted from eqn (2) that if only a single atom type of a specific element is presented in the calibration set, any change in χ * (denoted Δ χ *) can be perfectly compensated by an opposite change in η * (the magnitude of the change in η * is then −Δ χ */ q α ). Therefore, the increase of the effective hardness needed to compensate a larger effective electronegativity is −Δ χ */ q α . It is worth noting that it is only suitable for the element with negative charges in the calibration set, e.g. O, N, and F. However, the charges of all H atoms are positive and C has either positive or negative charge, so they do not have this trend.

From Soup: 46 To test whether and how much accuracy of EEM would be gained from distinguishing between different “types” of atoms of the same element with different chemical environments, the parameters for C, H, O, N and F without involving distinction, are recalibrated and optimized using the same methodology as that of the modified EEM method, and are used for comparison. The calibrated parameters are also listed in Table 2 .

From Soup: 47 To test the quality of the modified EEM charges, the atomic charges obtained from the original and modified EEM are compared with B3LYP/6-31G* charges for a large training set of molecules, respectively. The correlation results of atomic charges, obtained from the original and modified EEM method, with DFT charges, respectively, are shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI. † Also included are the corresponding root mean square error (RMSE) and average absolution deviation (DEV) (listed in Table S1 of the ESI † ).

From Soup: 48 It is obvious that the modified EEM charges are in good agreement with the DFT charges, and are much better than those of the original EEM charges. The correlation coefficients R 2 of modified EEM charges for corresponding atom types are remarkably higher than those of the original method EEM , especially for the RMSE and DEV of modified EEM , which decrease largely compared to those of the original EEM. It may be argued that for fluorine, and to a somewhat smaller extent for oxygen, the agreement is much less pronounced. This is due to the relatively lower spread in charges for the different atoms in the different molecules for them. Especially for fluorine, there are minor differences in charge in different molecules, resulting in much smaller differences between the B3LYP/6-31G* and EEM charges when compared to those of the other four elements in the calibration sets. Therefore, it is difficult to reproduce the very small changes in atomic charges between different fluorine atoms when the fluorine together with the other four element atoms are brought into the fitness function ( 6 ) for optimization.

From Soup: 49 From the mentioned above, distinguishing between different chemical environments for the same atom, each with their own effective electronegativity and hardness, would further improve the fit in the training set, although it will require much more effort to minimize the fitness function due to the increase in dimensionality of the calibration.

From Soup: 50 In the section above, the modified EEM charges show better agreement with the DFT charges than those of original EEM charges for the molecules contained in the calibration set. However, to assess the applicability of the modified EEM, one needs to consider the molecules that are not part of the calibration set. To that end, a number of large biological molecules such as linezolid and polypeptides ( alanine dipeptide , linear and fold Gly-Ala-Gly , Ala-Ala-Phe-Gla-Gla , Ala-Gla-Ala-Ser-Ile-Leu , Ala-Ala-Lys-Tyr-Asp-Asp-Ile-Lys-Lys-Val-Val-Lys.), are chosen as a test set. The framework structures of polypeptides listed in Fig. 3 are directly taken from the Peptide Atlas conference database (http://www.peptideatlas.org/) published by NIST.

From Soup: 52 It is clear that the quality of fitness between modified EEM charges and DFT charges improves greatly compared to those of the original EEM charges for the test molecules. For comparison, the parameters of the original EEM method are recalibrated in this work under the same conditions ( i.e. the same training set, optimized method, NPA charges derived method) as that of the modified method. The linear correlation coefficients R of all the predicted molecules obtained by the modified EEM method are higher than those of the corresponding original EEM . Compared to the original EEM charges, both the average and maximum absolute deviations for the modified EEM charge also decrease largely, although the calibration set used does not hold any of these polypeptides and chosen molecules. Taking the peptide Ala-Gla-Ala-Ser-Leu-Ile as an example, the average absolute deviations between calculated charges and DFT charges decrease from 0.0589 to 0.0327 eV, and the maximum value also drops to 0.0934 from 0.1948 eV when considering different chemical environments.

Atomic charges are very useful indicators . Fast calculation of atomic charges accurately for large biological molecules, especially for polypeptides , could be very useful.

From Soup: 54 The modified EEM described here provides a more accurate and reliable approach for fast calculation and prediction of atomic charges for large biological molecules by considering the effect of different connectivities, hybridization states, and aromatic systems. It is worth mentioning that choosing the optimization method is one of the key steps in the calibration. Moreover, no empirical approximation is made about the EEM expression and no restriction is imposed on any of the calibrated parameters, compared to previous EEM methods. 21–23,25–27,41

From Soup: 55 It is found that the atomic charges for a series of test molecules, obtained from the modified EEM, show good agreement with B3LYP/6-31G* charges, which is better than those from the original EEM method. This further demonstrates that atomic charges in molecules are connectivity and geometry-dependent. Thus, it is necessary to make a distinction between atoms in different chemical environments with apparent differences in charge. The calibrated parameters of modified EEM for C, H, O, N and F in this work will be useful for determining the NPA charges in large systems.
