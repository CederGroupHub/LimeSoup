From cou.: 1 We report non-resonant inelastic X-ray scattering experiments of several gaseous samples in the inner-shell excitation energy range. The experimental near-edge spectra from all the K-edges of N2, N2O, and CO2 including the momentum transfer dependence are presented. The results are analyzed using density functional theory calculations that accurately reproduce the experimental spectral features. We observe vibrational effects in the measured spectrum and in the calculations the atomic motion is modeled using the Franck–Condon approximation and the linear coupling model. Our findings show that vibrational effects cannot be neglected in the analysis of high resolution inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy. The results also support the validity of the transition potential approximation for calculating core excited state potential energy surfaces.

From cou.: 2 Spectroscopic experiments of gaseous samples provide important information on the atomic and electronic structure and dynamics as well as chemical processes of molecules. Infrared, optical and X-ray core-level spectroscopies are nowadays widely used experimental tools for such studies. Non-resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (NRIXS) has potential to overcome many challenges that may obscure the applicability of the above mentioned techniques. In particular, due to the penetrating power of the high energy X-rays used in NRIXS, the experiments can be carried out using elaborate, e.g. visibly opaque, sample cells.1 This makes it possible to carry out the measurements at extreme temperatures and pressures and thus in environments simulating e.g. upper or extraterrestrial atmospheres. Another appealing feature of the technique is that it can be used to obtain information on the ionic and electronic response in a wide energy range, i.e. from the infrared to hard X-ray energies. Moreover, the momentum transfer dependence (probed via changing the scattering angle) can provide a comprehensive picture of the excitations beyond the dipole selection rule.2

From cou.: 4 In the NRIXS process a high energy (typically around 10 keV) X-ray photon scatters from the sample so that energy ℏω and momentum ℏq are transferred to the target material. This causes an elementary excitation in the sample, such as electronic transition or induced atomic motion. Since one probes the scattering intensity as a function of the energy transfer, the NRIXS spectrum can be measured for the whole energy range below the incident photon energy. The double differential cross section corresponding to the scattering intensity to the solid angle element [Ω, Ω + dΩ] and energy transfer interval ℏ[ω, ω + dω] can be written within the first Born approximation as where is the Thomson scattering cross section and S(q, ω) is the dynamic structure factor that contains all the structural information of the sample material that can be obtained by NRIXS.1 In this work we focus on the part of the spectrum where excitations of core-level electrons can be probed, i.e. X-ray Raman scattering (XRS).

From cou.: 5 Like other widely used core-level spectroscopies, such as X-ray absorption (XAS) and electron energy-loss (EELS) spectroscopy, XRS is used to study the atomic and electronic structure of a wide range of different materials. The low cross section has obscured the use of NRIXS for samples with low electron density, and most XRS studies have therefore focused on liquids and solids.3–17 Nevertheless, during the last few years developments in synchrotron radiation instrumentation18,19 have extended the feasibility of the technique to new materials, phases, and experimental conditions. Experiments for gaseous samples have become feasible for sample cells where relatively high gas pressures can be realized.20–22 In this work we demonstrate the technique for the nitrogen, oxygen, and carbonK-edges of gaseous N2, N2O, and CO2. The observed electronic transitions for these gases are relatively well-known and their energies and molecular orbital assignments have been presented in the literature.23–27 We carried out new calculations with two objectives: to model the momentum transfer dependence of the spectral features and to account for the vibrational effects. Accurate simulations are valuable for the unambiguous interpretation of the experimental spectra.

From cou.: 6 The NRIXS experiment was carried out at beamline ID16 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF).19 The sample chamber was constructed from a commercially available quartz capillary (Hilgenberg GmbH) having a diameter of 2 mm and a wall thickness of 10 μm. The capillary was reinforced with a thin layer of epoxy, except for a 20 mm strip near the top of the capillary. The incident beam and scattered radiation passed through this non-coated part. The open end of the capillary was epoxy glued to a short stainless steel pipe, which in turn was connected to the gas lines using standard Swagelok fittings. A static and stable pressure of 40 bar could be consistently reached using this setup.

From cou.: 7 We employed additional gas valves situated closely before and after the capillary. In order to guarantee the purity of the sample, the capillary was evacuated to vacuum and pressurised several times before commencing with the data collection. All valves were kept closed during data collection in order to constrict gas leak in case of capillary failure. The gas samples were obtained from Air Liquide with the minimum purity of 99.99% and used without further purification.

From cou.: 8 Monochromatized incident radiation was used and the scattered radiation was analyzed using a multianalyzer crystal array employing the Si (660) reflection. The data were collected individually from each analyzer crystal using a Medipix2 pixel detector. Due to the nearly point-to-point focussing optics of the analyzer crystals and the use of the 2D detector, scattering from gas within the capillary and from the quartz capillary walls could be readily discriminated (see Fig. 1).28

From cou.: 9 With the incident energy of 9.68 keV, a total energy resolution of 0.5 eV was measured from the full width at half maximum of the elastic line. In order to increase the total irradiated gas volume, the capillary was positioned so that its long axis made an angle of 30° with the incident beam. The sample gas pressure was 35 bar and the measurement time for a single spectrum was approximately 10 h.

From cou.: 10 The XRS spectra for each sample were collected with 9 different analyzers at two average scattering angles (30° and 137°) of the multianalyzer setup, yielding 9 low-q and 9 high-qspectra for each sample. A constant background was subtracted from the low-qspectrum. From the high-qspectrum a Compton background was subtracted by approximating the part of the Compton profile below the edge by a Pearson VII function.29,30 The momentum transfer dependence was found to be small within the q-range covered by the analyzer array at a fixed value of the mean scattering angle. Therefore the data from each analyzer were summed together to yield a single low-qspectrum with a momentum transfer of 2.8 ± 0.7 Å−1. The high-qspectra were similarly averaged and thus a spectrum with the momentum transfer of 9.4 ± 0.3 Å−1 was extracted.

From cou.: 11 According to the Fermi golden rule, the coupling of the electromagnetic field with the electronic system leads to the following expression for the dynamic structure factor:1where the I and F denote all possible initial and final many-particle states of the system, and ωI and ωF are their energies. ρI is the statistical weight of the initial state I. The sum inside the matrix element is over all the electrons in the system. At energy transfers close to the X-ray absorption edges the dynamic structure factor can be usually calculated using a single particle framework where the effect of the core hole is included using, e.g. the transition potential approximation31 (TPA), Z + 1 approximation32 or the final state rule.33 Then the electrons occupy individual orbitals and when the vibrational excitations are neglected the dynamic structure factor becomes where the sums over ie and fe include all the occupied and the unoccupied electronic states, respectively, and ωie and ωfe are their energies (expressed in atomic units throughout this work, except for the numerical values that are given in eVs).34 In K-edge XRS the sum over the initial states is reduced to one term because only transitions from a specific (1s) inner-shell state are probed.

From cou.: 12 The calculation of the electronic properties of the studied system requires the knowledge of its molecular structure. In many applications it is sufficient to calculate the dynamic structure factor for the equilibrium structure (minimum energy configuration) only. The delta peak spectrum from eqn (3) is then broadened using an appropriate broadening scheme. The broadening is typically attributed to the finite lifetime of the excited electronic state, but part of it is also due to the vibrational effects. The vibrations can often be neglected in the analysis if the lifetime broadening (∼100 meV for K-edges of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen)35 or experimental energy resolution (∼50–1000 meV in XRS) is much larger than the vibrational frequencies of the system (∼10–500 meV). Because the recent developments in the instrumentation have made XRS experiments with high energy resolution possible19–21,36 and because quite different computational approaches exist in the literature37–42 we review here the applicable quantum mechanical treatment for including vibrational effects in the XRS spectra.

From cou.: 13 The vibrational effects appear in the electronic excitation spectra because the interatomic forces are different in the ground and excited electronic states. Quantum mechanically, the final state (|F〉 in eqn (2)) includes an excitation of both electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom, i.e. the vibrational state changes concurrently with the electronic excitation. The harmonic approximation of interatomic potentials is often used to understand and model the vibrational properties of molecules. This approximation enables the formulation of the atomic motion within the occupation number representation of the M vibrational normal modes denoted by the normal coordinates Qj.43 Simultaneously with the electronic excitation (from |ie〉 to |fe〉) the vibrational state changes from the initial state |iv〉 = |n1, n2,…, nM〉 to the final state . At zero temperature the only occupied initial vibrational state is the ground state, i.e. nj = 0 for all normal modes j. At higher temperatures one should consider an ensemble of initial vibrational state vectors where nonzero occupation numbers occur.

From cou.: 14 In the excitation process the vibrational energy changes from in the initial state to in the final state, where ωj and are the eigenfrequencies of the normal mode j in the initial and final states, respectively. When the interatomic forces (or, equivalently, potential energy surfaces) of the initial and final electronic states differ, the equilibrium geometry, normal coordinates, and vibrational frequencies are different in the two electronic states. The energy required for the excitation of the system is then Δωie,iv → fe,fv = ωfe − ωie + ωfv − ωiv, so that vibrational side peaks (fine structure) appear at energies that differ from each other by multiples of the vibrational frequencies.

From Soup: 39 In principle one should carry out the geometry optimization and normal mode analysis for each electronic final state (denoted by the unoccupied orbitals | fe 〉 in the single-particle picture). Probably the simplest approach for overcoming this cumbersome task is the linear coupling model ( LCM ). In this approximation the normal coordinates and vibrational frequencies are assumed to be the same in excited and ground electronic states, and the only thing that changes is the minimum energy configuration. 45 Despite its simplicity LCM often provides good results. 46,47 A more sophisticated approach is to express the final state vibrations using the initial state normal coordinates through Duschinsky transformation. 48–50 It is also possible to go beyond the harmonic approximation and the normal mode approach. Anharmonic effects can be handled e.g. using Morse potentials. 51 Treatment of double well potential energy surfaces has been described e.g. in ref. 52 . If the final state is dissociative, the vibrational effects can be simulated by the projection of the initial state vibrational wave function onto the final state potential energy surface. 53 An appealing approach is the propagation of nuclear wave packets in explicitly calculated potential energy surfaces. This method is capable of describing both dissociative and bound vibrational transitions. 54,55

From Soup: 40 The electronic structure calculations in this work were carried out using the StoBe-deMon software that utilizes density functional theory (DFT) and localized Gaussian basis functions. 56 The method for calculating the near-edge spectrum employs TPA to model the relaxation effects of the valence electrons in the presence of the core hole. In this scheme the occupation of the initial one-electron state is set to 0.5. 31,53 We used triple zeta plus valence polarization level basis sets ([1d,3p,4s] contractions from ref. 57 ), except for the excited atomic site for which we used the III-IGLO basis set and an additional set of diffuse basis functions ([25s,25p,25d] uncontracted set using the double basis set technique.). 58,59 Electronic exchange and correlation effects were included in the generalized gradient approximation level. 60,61 When the molecule contained multiple atoms of the same element as the excited one, the localization of the core hole was ensured by using model core potentials for the non-excited atoms. 62

From Soup: 41 The first step in our calculations was to determine the ground state structure by a geometry optimization routine, and then to solve the vibrational eigenmodes and frequencies (see Table 1 ). The XRS matrix elements M ie , fe ( q ) and transition energies ω fe − ω ie were calculated for the ground state configurations ( Q = 0) as described in ref. 34 . To include the vibrational effects in the excitation spectrum we use the LCM, which is a crude approximation especially for N 2 O and CO 2 (as discussed later) but nevertheless useful for the illustration of the effect. It also provides surprisingly good results here. As mentioned above, within LCM the normal coordinates remain unchanged in the electronic transition and the only thing that changes is the minimum energy configuration. These are calculated from the slope of the final state potential energy surfaces at the ground state geometry. For this purpose we carried out calculations for three configurations where the coordinates were slightly shifted in the direction of the normal coordinate vectors. These provide the derivatives of the final state potential energy surfaces, i.e. ∂ ω fe / ∂ Q v | Q v =0 , which in turn are required to calculate the Franck–Condon overlap integrals 〈 fv | iv 〉 63,64 and the minimum of the potential energy surface of the final electronic state ( i.e. ω fe ). The vibrational calculations were only carried out for the lowest transitions that are also the most pronounced ones in the XRS spectra.

From Soup: 42 The dynamic structure factor can then be calculated using eqn (4) and (5) . We used the temperature of 300 K to generate the sets of vibrational state vectors | iv 〉 for the initial state and the corresponding weights ρ iv according to the Boltzmann statistics. The number of included initial states was chosen using the condition ∑ iv ρ iv > 99%. Most vibrational transitions give negligible contribution to the XRS spectrum, and therefore only the most significant ones were included in our calculations. Using the completeness relations of Franck–Condon overlap integrals, we ensured that more than 98% of the intensity is included in the calculation.
 ###### 
From cou.: 43 The first step in our calculations was to determine the ground state structure by a geometry optimization routine, and then to solve the vibrational eigenmodes and frequencies (see Table 1). The XRS matrix elements Mie,fe(q) and transition energies ωfe − ωie were calculated for the ground state configurations (Q = 0) as described in ref. 34. To include the vibrational effects in the excitation spectrum we use the LCM, which is a crude approximation especially for N2O and CO2 (as discussed later) but nevertheless useful for the illustration of the effect.

The vibrational calculations were only carried out for the lowest transitions that are also the most pronounced ones in the XRS spectra.
From Soup: 43 The calculated XRS spectrum consists of a set of delta peaks because the finite lifetime of the electronic excitations is not accounted for in our approach (except for dissociative transitions, see below). The delta peak spectra were broadened using a Lorentzian linewidth whose energy dependence is given in Table 2 . Despite the lack of a proper justification this kind of scheme is commonly employed to facilitate the comparison with experiment. 34 To align the calculated spectra with experimental results, rigid energy shifts of approximately 1 eV (see Table 2 ) were applied. We also used Gaussian convolution with FWHM = 0.5 eV in order to take the instrumental resolution of the experiment into account.

From cou.: 44 The dynamic structure factor can then be calculated using eqn (4) and (5).

From Soup: 44 The lineshape of the one dissociative transition (observed in the oxygen K -edge spectrum of N 2 O) was approximated by a Lorentzian whose FWHM was obtained by projecting the initial state vibrational wave function onto the final state potential energy surface along the dissociative mode's normal coordinate Q v . 53 In the case of a linear potential energy surface the result is a Gaussian and the , where σ 2 v is the variance of the initial state vibrational wave function.

The delta peak spectra were broadened using a Lorentzian linewidth whose energy dependence is given in Table 2. Despite the lack of a proper justification this kind of scheme is commonly employed to facilitate the comparison with experiment.34 To align the calculated spectra with experimental results, rigid energy shifts of approximately 1 eV (see Table 2) were applied. We also used Gaussian convolution with FWHM = 0.5 eV in order to take the instrumental resolution of the experiment into account.
From Soup: 45 Here we present the experimental q -dependent XRS near-edge spectra together with comparisons to calculations. Each pair of theoretical and experimental spectra are normalized to equal integrated area, and all main features are denoted by capital letters to help comparison. The momentum transfer dependence generally makes the identification of the experimental features easier as the symmetry properties of the corresponding final electronic states can be distinguished. 2 It therefore facilitates the assignment of the experimental and calculated features. The vibrational fine structure was calculated for all denoted transitions.

From cou.: 46 The lineshape of the one dissociative transition (observed in the oxygenK-edge spectrum of N2O) was approximated by a Lorentzian whose FWHM was obtained by projecting the initial state vibrational wave function onto the final state potential energy surface along the dissociative mode's normal coordinate Qv.53 In the case of a linear potential energy surface the result is a Gaussian and the , where σ2v is the variance of the initial state vibrational wave function.
From Soup: 46 The experimental and calculated K -edge spectra for N 2 are shown in Fig. 2 . The momentum transfer dependence of the spectral features is well reproduced by the calculation. Feature A at 401 eV is the preionization peak that corresponds to the transition to the antibonding π-type state. Its measured momentum transfer dependence is in line with previously published EELS results. 65 Features B and C are assigned to the 3sσ and 3pπ Rydberg states, respectively. 25 The pronounced s-type character increases the intensity of feature B at high momentum transfer.

From Soup: 47 The experimental and computational spectra for the nitrogen and oxygen K -edges of N 2 O are shown in Fig. 3 . The overall agreement is again strong, and the calculation reproduces the momentum transfer dependence of all the main features A–H. In contrast to N 2 , two main transitions (features A and B) appear in the nitrogen K -edge of N 2 O due to the different chemical surroundings of the two nitrogens in the molecule (N–N–O). Peak A originates from the excitation of the atom at the end of the molecule, and feature B originates from the central nitrogen . In both cases the transition is from 1s to a π-type state, similarly to the N 2 spectrum. The low-energy shoulder of feature B also contains a small peak that is not clearly resolved with the present experimental energy resolution. It has been distinguished in various previous works 23,66 and is also reproduced in our calculations. This and feature C are due to the transitions from terminal nitrogen to 3sσ and 4sσ states, respectively. 23 Similarly, features D and E get their intensity mostly from the corresponding transitions of the central nitrogen , although at this energy range also numerous Rydberg-type final states contribute slightly. The q -dependence of these features, which is also reproduced by our calculations, facilitates the assignment.

From Soup: 48 The oxygen K -edge spectrum of N 2 O consists of three main features. Feature F again corresponds to the excitation to a π-type final state, and its weight decreases with increasing q . In contrast, feature G becomes more pronounced at large q . The corresponding final electronic state (3sσ) is dissociative 67 and therefore it does not show a vibrational fine structure. The broad feature H has been attributed to various final states, in particular 3pπ, 4sσ, and 5sσ. 23,67 In our calculation it consists almost completely of the 4sσ transition.

From Soup: 49 The experimental and computational spectra for the carbon and oxygen K -edges of CO 2 are shown in Fig. 4 . Also here the main features (A–F) of the experimental spectra are well reproduced in the calculations. Both strongest peaks (features A and D) correspond to transitions to the lowest-lying π-type final state. The intensities of the peaks B and C of the computational high- q spectrum are slightly overestimated. These features can be assigned to the excitations to the 3sσ state and to several Rydberg states, respectively. 26 Moreover, the calculated low- q spectrum significantly underestimates the intensity of feature B. The reason is that this peak is dipole forbidden and gains its intensity at low q mainly by a vibronic coupling effect 68,69 which is not included in our calculations. Its nonzero intensity in the simulation is only due to the finite momentum transfer value and it would vanish completely at the dipole limit q → 0.

From Soup: 50 The oxygen K -edge spectrum of CO 2 also contains three main features. Feature E lies in the high-energy shoulder of feature D and corresponds to the 3sσ state. Its weight increases at large q , which can be observed both in the calculation and experiment. The third feature (F) contains transitions to Rydberg-like final states, mainly the ones assigned as 3pσ, 3pπ, and 4sσ in ref. 26 . Contrary to the corresponding feature C in the carbon K -edge spectrum, they have only very weak q -dependence.

From Soup: 51 In order to demonstrate the effect of atomic motion on the XRS spectra we compare the dynamic structure factors of N 2 O and CO 2 calculated with and without vibrational effects, i.e. using eqn (4) and (3) , respectively. The result for low q is shown in Fig. 5 . The most significant difference is the vibrational broadening which follows from the distribution of the spectral weight to the various peaks in the fine structure. The vibrational effect would be more prominent at better energy resolution. For instance, the energy of the only vibrational mode of the nitrogen molecule in the core-excited electronic state corresponding to the preionization peak is 0.23 eV. In order to observe the fine structure, energy resolution would need to be smaller than this. 70,71 Such resolution is in fact feasible 19,21,36 and highly desirable for these studies.

From Soup: 52 Although the inclusion of the vibrational effects in our calculations improves the agreement with experiment, the simulated lineshapes are not sufficiently broad. This can be attributed to the shortcomings of the linear coupling model, the transition potential approximation, and the harmonic approximation. The broadening is sensitive to the curvature of the potential energy surface, and the resulting features are generally not symmetric. 42,70–73 The asymmetry is observed in the experimental spectra and is also reproduced by our calculations. This is demonstrated in Fig. 6 for the lowest-energy transitions at nitrogen and carbon K -edges of N 2 , N 2 O, and CO 2 . All of these experimental features are clearly asymmetric, with more weight on the high-energy part. The calculations for the vibrational fine structure explain this observation, as also demonstrated in the figure. The calculated result for N 2 is also in line with the experimental, vibrationally resolved spectrum presented in ref. 70 . For N 2 O and CO 2 the calculated vibrational fine structure is separated into two parts according to the two final electronic states that contribute to this transition. In the equilibrium configuration these states are degenerate, but vibrational distortions break the degeneracy into Renner–Teller pair states, and as a result the two states show different vibrational fine structures. 74 Our calculation for CO 2 is in line with the experimental result of ref. 74 . Such good agreement is somewhat surprising because harmonic approximation for the potential energy surface is a very crude model in this case. For a more accurate calculation one should replace the harmonic potential by a double well. 52

The result for low q is shown in Fig. 5. The most significant difference is the vibrational broadening which follows from the distribution of the spectral weight to the various peaks in the fine structure.

From Soup: 53 The accuracy of the present calculations for the vibrational effects is promising because we make several approximations whose accuracy can be questioned. First of all, LCM is in many cases a good scheme but its use might not be fully justified for transitions to states with significantly different vibrational properties compared to the ground state. It is also clear that the harmonic approximation for the potential energy surfaces is not always valid. This is also the case for some core-excited final states of N 2 O and CO 2 , as mentioned earlier. Furthermore, the transition energies and intensities are calculated using TPA, but it is not well known if this method provides reliable potential energy surfaces. In order to get a better understanding of the accuracy of the used approximations, we carried out presumably more accurate ΔKS calculations for the fine structure of the preionization peak of N 2 ( Fig. 6(a) ). In this method the excited state potential energy is calculated from the total energy difference between the initial (ground) and final states (an electron removed from the core state and added to the LUMO). ΔKS is theoretically a better justified method than TPA for calculating the transition energies of the lowest-lying core-excited states, but its application for high-lying transitions is not as straightforward. Because of the two electronic states with different vibrational response involved in N 2 O and CO 2 , we did not carry out ΔKS calculations for these molecules. Nevertheless, for N 2 the resulting vibrational fine structure was very similar to that obtained with TPA. This suggests that TPA can be used to calculate the curvatures of the core excited state potential energy surfaces. The conclusion is also supported by our calculations for N 2 O where we found very similar curvatures of the potential energy surfaces as previously calculated using the configuration interaction method. 67

From Soup: 54 We present the momentum transfer dependent XRS spectra at the K -edges of gaseous nitrogen , nitrous oxide , and carbon dioxide. The experimental results are analyzed using a density functional theory based method that accurately reproduces the main features of the experimental spectra and their momentum transfer dependence. We show how the vibrational effects can be included in the calculation and demonstrate that they are essential for the correct interpretation of the data. In particular, we report the asymmetry of several peaks in the experimental spectra, and explain this in terms of the simultaneous excitation of electronic and vibrational states. Our calculations suggest that the transition potential approximation is an applicable method for calculating the core excited state potential energy surfaces in these cases. This finding is important because TPA is a computationally tractable method and in particular it enables calculating various excited states simultaneously. The linear coupling model that was used for simulating the vibrational effects is a powerful method but has certain limitations. In particular it produces inaccurate results when the harmonic approximation for the potential energy surface is not valid, e.g. for dissociative transitions (like the 3sσ transition in the oxygen K -edge spectrum of N 2 O). More accurate calculations involve going beyond LCM by including Duschinsky rotations 48–50 and loosening the harmonic approximation. 51,52,55 Another possible improvement is the inclusion of vibronic coupling effects. 68,69,75 Furthermore, especially for larger molecules it could be useful to employ the continuum model for the vibrational effects. 76

From Soup: 55 The present results show that inelastic X-ray scattering is a powerful spectroscopic tool also for gaseous samples. The exceptional properties of this technique open up new possibilities for the study of chemically relevant molecules and their reactions. The momentum transfer dependence reveals the symmetry properties of the observed transitions and thus facilitates their assignment with corresponding electronic states. Improved energy resolution will also enable measurements of vibrationally resolved excitation spectra . Due to the good penetration of hard X-rays, elaborate sample cells can be utilized to carry out experiments under elevated temperatures and pressures, thus providing an emergent tool for in situ spectroscopic experiments.

From Soup: 133 The element ( ) = 〈 |e | 〉 depends on the atomic configuration in which the one-electron states | 〉 and | 〉 are calculated. The configuration can be expressed in terms of normal coordinates and therefore we denote it by ( , ). Expanding the matrix element around = 0 and taking the leading terms one obtains for the transition | , 〉 → | , 〉 The first term shows that within Franck–Condon (FC) approximation the vibrational side peak intensities are determined by the overlaps 〈 | 〉. The second term describes the Herzberg–Teller effect which is usually very weak but can be important when the first term is negligible because of the symmetry reasons. In this work we nevertheless only focus on the first term.
