From cou.: 1 In this investigation we use THz time-scale spectroscopy to conduct an initial set of studies on myoglobin with the aim of providing further insight into the global, collective thermal fluctuations in the protein that have been hypothesized to play a prominent role in the dynamic formation of transient ligand channels as well as in shaping the molecular level basis for ligand discrimination. Using the two ligands O2 and CO, we have determined that the perturbation from the heme–ligand complex has a strong influence on the characteristics of the myoglobin collective dynamics that are excited upon binding. Further, the differences detected in the collective protein motions in Mb–O2 compared with those in Mb–CO appear to be intimately tied with the pathways of long-range allosteric communication in the protein, which ultimately determine the trajectories selected by the respective ligands on the path to and from the heme-binding cavity.

From cou.: 2 Myoglobin (Mb) is a small globular protein that stores and transports oxygen (O2) in muscles. The heme cofactor buried inside of the hydrophobic core is also able to bind to other small diatomic gas molecules such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrous oxide (NO), and even cyanide (CN−). In recent years it has been recognized that Mb is capable of performing tasks other than simply the transport and storage of O2 and may also play a pivotal role in oxidative phosphorylation as well as the scavenging of NO.1 The wealth of information that has arisen in the decades since structure determination has afforded the heme protein to emerge as a model system that is ideal for studying structure–function relationships in proteins in general. But despite the theoretical and experimental advances that have been made in understanding the role of protein dynamics in oxygen storage and transport through study of myoglobin as a paradigm for oxygen-carrying proteins, the underlying mechanism associated with ligand migration within the protein structure has not yet been unraveled. Structural studies have indicated that the ligand molecule is able to migrate within the protein via distinct cavities referred to as xenon cavities.2,3 And conversely, opening and closing of these cavities arise from protein thermal fluctuations that transiently form interconnecting channels that allow the ligand to travel throughout the protein interior and outward toward the exterior solvent.

From cou.: 3 Recently, it has been proposed that fast, low-frequency protein fluctuations are in some way connected with the energy transport mechanism that takes place between the active site and the rest of the protein during ligand migration.4,5 Hence these collective, thermal fluctuations (∼KBT) may be directly related to the myoglobin function. One of the interesting aspects of myoglobin is that despite the fact that the protein is capable of binding various ligands, it does seem to preferentially bind molecular oxygen. O2 has a lower barrier for entering the protein-binding pocket6 and once inside it is also able to explore a much larger part of the protein interior when compared with other ligands. On the other hand, while not the favored ligand, it has also been demonstrated that the heme in myoglobin has a binding affinity for CO that is 200 times greater when compared with that for O2. This dichotomy has been explained mostly in terms of steric differences between the contrasting ligands, but upon reflection it may actually indicate that the fundamental mechanism related to heme Fe-ligand selectivity and ligand diffusion in myoglobin is not well understood, particularly, the role that protein functional modes play in both processes. Hence, exploring the transient nature of protein–ligand interactions in the low-frequency regime may provide a richer picture of how protein motions are able to couple with the mechanism of functional allostery and signal communication pathways in myoglobin as well as other oxygen-binding proteins. Specifically, in this work we use THz time-scale spectroscopy to explore the role of collective, thermal fluctuations in myoglobin functionality and ligand specificity. There have been numerous optical spectroscopy and computational3,7–11methods that have tackled this subject-matter by focusing primarily on the optical transition of the heme as the central objective to infer details about the ligand migration dynamics taking place within the protein whole. These measurements probe the local, structural changes around the heme–ligand interaction, but do not generally provide a great deal of information about the global, structural changes taking place within protein as a whole during the binding/migration process. Nonetheless, this approach has proven to be quite informative and most current models of myoglobin have arrived at the same conclusion: the ligand has to overcome a series of energy barriers to migrate from the exterior hydration shell to the hydrophobic active-site, in addition to transitioning to different regions within the interior of the protein. It is for this reason that we focus our investigation on the THz time scale, structural fluctuations in myoglobin that may play a central role in facilitating the network of interactions that lead to the formation of the ligand binding and migration patterns that have been linked with protein function.

For each transmission measurement a 25 mm diameter region of the protein sample was illuminated with the THz beam to determine the absorbance. In the spectral measurements presented, each scan consists of 16 averaged scans and the infrared data were collected with a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1. The 15–100 cm−1 THz spectra were collected with a 25 micron beam splitter while the data in the 100–250 cm−1 spectral region were collected with a 12 micron beam splitter. The temperature of the samples was varied using a SPECAC variable temperature cell and could be adjusted from −190 °C to 30 °C.

From cou.: 5 Wild-type (WT) and V68F sperm whale myoglobin were purchased from Biosynthesis (Lewisville, Texas). The samples were initially passed through a desalting filter to remove excess salt and then resuspended in degassed, double-distilled phosphate buffer prior to use with a final concentration of 1 mg mL−1. The protein film samples were prepared by allotting 20 uL of the prepared sample onto a high-resistivity silicon window and excess water was initially removed by applying a low, steady flow of N2 gas over the sample droplet for approximately 10 minutes. The resulting protein film was subsequently rehydrated by equilibrating the partially dried sample in a vacuum sealed container with the vapor pressure of a saturated salt solution at 20 °C for a minimum of 5 days.12 A relative humidity (RH) of 97% was obtained from the vapor pressure of a saturated K2SO4 solution.13 At this hydration level, the water molecules available in the hydration layer are sufficient for completing both the first and second hydration shells of the protein14 which should relate to a biologically relevant hydration level15 in the myoglobin samples.

From cou.: 8 The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried with the Gromacs package (www.gromacs.org) version 4.6 using the GROMOS96 43a2 force field.16,17 The starting structure of WT sperm whale myoglobin and the V68F mutated structure were initially downloaded from the protein databank (1MBO.pdb and 1MLJ.pdb respectively). For the Mb–CO simulations, the O2 ligand was replaced with CO. Both the CO and O2 force field parameters were taken from a modified version of the CHARMM22 force field.6 The protonation of the His residues for equilibrium simulations was set to their average protonation states.18 For the WT Mb-ligand simulations considered, 2026 water molecules were added, in which the SPC model of water was used and 2 sodium ions were also added to neutralize the system. V68F MD simulations contained 2324 water molecules and 2 sodium atoms. Energy minimization to reduce the number of unfavorable contacts between the initially added solvent molecules and the protein was carried out by using a steepest descent method to a convergence tolerance of 0.001 kJ mol−1. The energy minimization was followed by a MD run with constraints for 200 ps in which an isotropic force constant of 100 kJ mol−1 nm−1 was used on the protein atoms. During the restrained dynamics simulation, the temperature and pressure of the system were kept constant by weak coupling to a modified velocity rescaled Berendsen temperature19 and pressure baths and in all cases the protein, water, small molecules, and ions were coupled to the temperature and pressure baths separately. The final output configuration from the MD simulation with constraints was used as the starting configuration for an initial 100 ns equilibrium MD simulation. Six subsequent simulations were conducted where configurations from the last 50 ns of the equilibrium simulations were used as starting point conformations for each different simulation. These subsequent simulations were carried out for an additional 50 ns and were eventually used to assess the picosecond time scale fluctuations in the protein systems. The final simulations were carried out with a 1 fs time step where the bonds between the hydrogen and the other heavier atoms were restrained to their equilibrium values with the linear constraints (LINCS) algorithm.20 The particle mesh Ewald (PME) method21 was used to calculate the electrostatic interactions in the simulation and was used with a real-space cutoff of 1.0 nm, a fourth order B-spline interpolation and a minimum grid spacing of 0.12 nm.

Translational and rotational motions were removed by a least squares fitting to a reference structure. The eigenvectors of C were determined by diagonalization with an orthonormal transformation matrix. The resulting eigenvectors from the transformation were used to determine the PCA modes with eigenvalues (λ) equivalent to the variance in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector. The MD trajectory was projected onto the principal modes to determine the principal components. The eigenvalues λi of the principal components denote the mean square fluctuation of the principal component i and are arranged so that λ1 ≥ λ2≥⋯≥λ3N. Using this arrangement, the trajectories were filtered along the first principal component to analyze the collective dynamics taking place within the protein. The cosine content of the PCA modes presented was less than 0.001.

From Soup: 37 A modified version of Gromacs 4.5.3 was used to write out forces, F ij between each atom pair i and j . Forces include contributions from the electrostatic and van der Waals interactions involving the heme group and the protein that are calculated below a certain cut-off distance. These non-bonded pairwise forces of the atom pairs in close proximity comprise a force-propagation network involving short-range to medium-range connections that are averaged over the simulation time. 26 The averaged forces were saved every 10 ps and convergence was reached when an equilibrium value for the forces was attained. The stored forces were written out as force trajectories and the average of those forces were used later for further analysis in R as well as visualization in VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). Changes in pair-wise forces were calculated by comparing the forces from myoglobin without a ligand to myoglobin bound to a ligand.

From cou.: 42 Conservation and coevolution analysis.
From Soup: 42 The conservation and coevolutionary analyses on the globin family sequences were carried out with the MISTIC 28 server. The Mutual Information score as implemented in MISTIC is calculated between pairs of columns in the MSA. The frequency for each amino acid pair is calculated using sequence weighting and low count corrections and compared with the expected frequency assuming that mutations between amino acids are uncorrelated. The MI score is calculated as a weighted sum of the log ratios between the observed and expected amino acid pair frequencies. The coevolution propensity is evaluated using the method of Dunn et al. 29 to minimize the background mutual information signal for each pair of residues and the effects of shared ancestry in evaluating coevolutionary patterns. Finally, the MI scores were translated into MI z -scores by comparing the MI values for each pair of position with a distribution of prediction scores obtained from the large dataset of the MSA. A z -score threshold of 6.5 describes a sensitivity of 0.4 and a specificity of 0.95 and MISTIC lists every MI value between two residues >6.5.

From Soup: 46 Myoglobin possesses an evolutionarily conserved proximal histidine (His 93) that is directly bound to the heme group through a covalent bond. The proximal histidine has been linked with ligand conformational changes in response to dynamic motions of myoglobin on the nanosecond and longer time scales. 31 Additionally, there is another histidine localized distal but not attached to the heme (His 64) that is conserved within the globin subfamily and is in a position suitable for hydrogen-bond formation to the ligand. The distal histidine is thought to have a strong influence on the protein–ligand binding kinetics. Results from sperm-whale Mb-ligand computational investigations have indicated that the interaction with residues in the heme distal pocket (residues Lys 45, Asp 60, His 64, and Val 68) adjusts ligand access to Fe in the heme buried active-site by modifying the size and shape of the distal cavity. 10 Theoretical studies on oxy-Mb in particular have shown that rotation of the distal histidine (His 64) sidechain creates a channel (His-gate) from the protein hydrophobic binding pocket out to the solvent. It has been conjectured that the coupled protein motions involved in opening ligand channel pathways (not just the His-gate) comprise thermal, collective fluctuations that extended over the entire protein. 4 And further, these collective fluctuations excite localized gating motions in the protein, which are linked with ligand channel formation. Recently, extended MD simulations 2,3,7,32–38 have allowed the tracking of CO migration in the interior of the protein that closely resembles experimental 9,39–42 photolysis measurements on myoglobin. Intriguingly, in both experimental and computational investigations, cavities have been identified in the protein structure that open spontaneously via small but widely distributed protein movements that are representative of low frequency protein fluctuations 3,43–47 rather than large protein conformational changes.

Recently, extended MD simulations2,3,7,32–38 have allowed the tracking of CO migration in the interior of the protein that closely resembles experimental9,39–42 photolysis measurements on myoglobin. Intriguingly, in both experimental and computational investigations, cavities have been identified in the protein structure that open spontaneously via small but widely distributed protein movements that are representative of low frequency protein fluctuations3,43–47 rather than large protein conformational changes.
From Soup: 47 In our preliminary experiments we have used THz spectroscopy to probe the picosecond time scale equilibrium dynamics of myoglobin in the presence of a few different ligands. In this manuscript we will limit our discussion so that we focus on contrasting myoglobin dynamics with two specific ligands: O 2 and CO. Initial results have indicated that the response to myoglobin in the presence of O 2 is quite distinctive when compared to that of CO. For example, experimentally in the ≤100 cm −1 region of the THz spectrum, we find that the Mb–O 2 and Mb–CO spectrum differ in significant ways ( Fig. 1 ). Below the protein glass transition temperature ( T g ), the Mb–O 2 sample comprises harmonic fluctuations but these fluctuations become anharmonic once the transition temperature has taken place. Specifically, below T g the oxy-Mb sample has discernible peaks at approximately 80 cm −1 and 65 cm −1 ( Fig. 1b ). Once T g has been reached there is a shift in the dominant collective motion in the protein, which is reflected by a new broad peak that emerges in the spectrum that is centered at about 55 cm −1 . The shift in the peak frequency accompanied by the large increase in intensity suggests that motions detected in the THz spectra of Mb–O 2 are characteristically anharmonic. The temperature progression of carbonmonoxy-Mb in the same region ( Fig. 1a ) suggests that the low frequency motions are smaller-scale by depiction. The prominent peaks at 80 cm −1 and ∼65 cm −1 grow only modestly as a function of temperature, and far above T g there is a perceptible, small shoulder in the Mb–CO spectrum at about 30 cm −1 . Curiously, the low frequency thermal fluctuations detected in Mb–O 2 and Mb–CO resemble one another below T g , but once the transition temperature has been reached their dynamics visibly diverge.

From Soup: 48 The <100 cm −1 region of the infrared spectrum is sensitive to global, internal fluctuations that encode the intrinsic dynamics of the protein. These globally, correlated thermal fluctuations allow the protein to sample the ensemble of conformations that make-up the free energy landscape of all possible protein conformations. 32,48,49 Moreover, it has been suggested that changes in protein global motions in response to a general perturbation, such as ligand binding, allows one to determine how sampling of the available protein conformational states alters the protein active-site binding dynamics and concurrently directs the dynamical distribution of propagation pathways in the protein structure. 50–54 To this end, performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on equivalent myoglobin systems assists in reducing some of the ambiguity that arises when considering only experimental data. In this case, we find that MD simulations are a useful tool for shedding light on the primary causes that lead to the dissimilarities that are captured in the experimental spectra of Mb–O 2 and Mb–CO. Additionally, it allows us to focus on specific protein–ligand interactions that are not readily accessible through the experiment.

From cou.: 50 Radius of gyration (Rg) and myoglobin collective breathing motion.
From Soup: 50 An analysis of the radius of gyration ( R g ) from the MD simulations ( Fig. 2 ) indicates that in general myoglobin with CO as a ligand is more rigid and less tightly packed 55 compared with the protein bound to O 2 . An ensuing Fourier transform of R g and examination of the comparable structures has revealed variations in the number of interhelical H-bonds in Mb–CO when compared with that of Mb–O 2 combined with distinct differences in the protein collective dynamics. With both ligands, the protein motion being probed in the analysis of R g from the MD simulation corresponds to a global, collective breathing motion. This collective breathing motion in Mb–CO reflects the motion of the protein structure that is rather inflexible due to the hydrogen bonds between neighboring helices in the protein secondary structure, whereas in Mb–O 2 the number of interhelical H-bonds is reduced leading to a more compressible structure. The differences in protein dynamics become more apparent in the spectrum of R g . The coherent oscillations in the Mb–CO sample culminate as a prominent peak in the spectrum at approximately 55 cm −1 that is associated with the collective breathing motion involving the helices in the protein secondary structure. The spectrum also contains a shoulder at ∼80 cm −1 that stems from torsional oscillations within the interhelical H-bond network. The spectrum of Mb–O 2 on the other hand has a single dominant peak that also reflects global, collective fluctuations. In this case, the coherent breathing dynamics peak at approximately 50 cm −1 . The red-shift in the peak frequency and the corresponding increase in intensity in the Mb–O 2 spectrum when compared with that of Mb–CO points to a more compact structure that at the same time has a higher degree of motional freedom. Moreover, the 80 cm −1 mode is not readily visible in the oxy-Mb spectrum reflecting the general disruption of the inter-helical hydrogen bond network in the myoglobin protein structure when bound to O 2 .

 ###### 
From cou.: 52 Full correlation analysis (FCA) and protein correlated fluctuations.
From Soup: 52 In this study, we have used full correlation analysis (FCA) to quantify correlated fluctuations taking place in myoglobin from the MD simulations. From this analysis, it is possible to refine the overall description of how changes in the intra-protein interactions influence the collective fluctuations taking place within the protein. A map of the atomic correlations of Mb–CO ( Fig. 3a ) from FCA reveals regions in the protein secondary structure that support in-phase, collective fluctuations. The corresponding projection of the FCA mode onto the protein configuration ( Fig. 3b ) clearly demonstrates the effect of the fluctuations on the dynamics of the entire protein. Specifically, correlated fluctuations in Mb–CO engage helices E, C, C/D loop, and H loop as well as segments of helices A, the E/F loop, and the B/C loop. The collective fluctuations in Mb–CO are mostly motivated by interhelical H-bonds formed between neighboring helical regions in the myoglobin secondary structure. The end result is modulation around the active-site that modestly alters the residue distances close to the distal histidine. From the correlation map of Mb–O 2 ( Fig. 3c ), it becomes apparent that there are a diminished number of atomic correlations with O 2 as the bound ligand in myoglobin when compared with CO. Intriguingly, the motions associated with the correlated fluctuations are also more localized in nature when contrasted with those of Mb–CO. The primary reason lies with the fact that many of the interhelical H-bonds are disrupted or modified when myoglobin is bound to O 2 . And interestingly, this variation in the helical H-bonding network produces both in-phase and out-of-phase correlated fluctuations in the oxy-Mb protein structure ( Fig. 3d ). The out-of-phase collective fluctuations promote a twisting motion on the proximal side of the heme that comprises segments of helix E (Gly 73) with parts of helix F (Leu 86) and helix H (Gly 124). This out-of-phase twisting motion produces an alternating compression/expansion dynamic that dramatically displaces the E/F loop and simultaneously modifies packing interactions within the protein hydrophobic core. The out-of-phase correlated fluctuations in Mb–O 2 are coupled to in-phase collective protein motions that involve segments of Helix A, B/C loop, C/D loop, and the E/F loop. The joint in-phase and out-of-phase protein oscillations ultimately translate into a rigid, rotational elongation that modulates the upper region of Helix E (near the ligand binding site), Helix D, and the C/D loop.

From Soup: 53 So far, we have utilized two different ligands in myoglobin and have observed differences in the intrinsic protein global motions in the presence of the distinct diatomic gas molecules. In an attempt to comprehend the relationship between ligand binding and protein global changes, we have adopted an approach that combines computational simulations and experimental THz spectroscopy. Initial analyses have indicated that the allosteric response in myoglobin is strongly influenced by coherent fluctuations involving interhelical protein H-bonding. Variations in the protein intramolecular H-bond network appear to have a profound effect on the collective, protein fluctuations and the conformational flexibility within the protein structure. For instance, when bound to O 2 , myoglobin supports large-amplitude, anharmonic oscillations that promote adjustments in both the hydrophobic core as well as the prominent, localized motion on the distal side of the heme group. But when bound to CO, the effect on both protein global dynamics and structure is far subtler when compared with that of O 2 . Binding to CO is associated with smaller-scale structural fluctuations around the distal site and the intrinsic protein motions are delimited by an extensive network of hydrogen-bonds between neighboring helices.

Binding to CO is associated with smaller-scale structural fluctuations around the distal site and the intrinsic protein motions are delimited by an extensive network of hydrogen-bonds between neighboring helices.
From Soup: 54 Experimentally, we are also able to detect more localized protein segmental motions ( i.e. protein motions comprising a subset of the molecule rather than the entire protein) in the 100–250 cm −1 spectral region ( Fig. 4 ). Motions detected in this higher frequency part of the THz spectrum are sensitive to local relaxations that reflect specific intramolecular and intermolecular induced protein fluctuations. Interestingly, localized intermolecular interactions have been hypothesized to form the basis of allosteric signal propagation in proteins. 56 In this work, upon contrasting the Mb–O 2 spectrum ( Fig. 4b ) with that of Mb–CO ( Fig. 4a ) in the 100–170 cm −1 spectral region, it becomes more apparent that protein–ligand dynamics in Mb–O 2 is characteristically anharmonic while the fluctuations reflected by the vibrational bands in the Mb–CO spectrum remain at a smaller amplitude for all observed temperatures. In both samples we discern peaks at ∼120 cm −1 , 144 cm −1 , and 165 cm −1 in the higher frequency THz region and a perceptible shoulder at approximately 105 cm −1 far above T g . Modes at a similar frequency have been uncovered in previous experimental measurements on heme proteins. 5 In particular, we notice from this investigation that the ∼120 cm −1 mode in the O 2 spectrum is clearly anharmonic and initial analyses have revealed that the motion may reflect a specific network of interactions that arise in response to ligand binding. Explicitly, from the MD simulations we are able to identify a distinct pattern of hydrogen bonds that appear to have a strong influence on the localized motions of the protein that impact the dynamics around the binding site ( Fig. 5 ). In Mb–CO there are key hydrogen bonds ( Fig. 5a ) connecting Helix A with Helix E (Trp 14 and Glu 18 H-bond to Lys 77) and another set linking the C/D loop with distal pocket residues (His 64 H-bonded to Arg 45, Thr 67, and Val 68). These dynamical subset of hydrogen bonds appear to have a direct connection with varying the protein active-site binding shape and perhaps also somehow indirectly reflect a signal propagation pathway in the protein three-dimensional structure. 51 When the ligand is replaced with O 2 , the hydrogen bonds physically linking helix E with helix A are ruptured and consequently, there is redistribution in the pattern of H-bonds involving the distal histidine that coincidentally, also seems to be the precursor for anharmonic motion in the protein. In Mb–CO, the hydrogen bonds shared between His 64 and the surrounding distal pocket residues mostly include H-bonds to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of His 64 to the side-chain atoms of Arg 45, Thr 67, and Val 68. In Mb–O 2 , there is a reshuffling of hydrogen bonds of His 64 and its connection to the surrounding residues. In this case, the backbone amino atoms of His 64 are dynamically linked to the carbonyl oxygen atoms of both Asp 60 and Asp 61 ( Fig. 5b ). A plot of the velocity autocorrelation spectrum ( Fig. 5c ) of the backbone amino atoms in His 64 from both MD simulations highlight the variations in the immediate active-site binding environment when contrasting the two ligands. The backbone NH stretching mode in the CO sample has a prominent peak at 143 cm −1 that reflects an out-of-plane stretching motion that adjusts the shape of the distal pocket cavity region. In Mb–O 2 , the same fluctuation grows in intensity and shifts to 100 cm −1 , suggesting both a weaker H-bonding environment and a larger amplitude oscillation associated with the backbone motion of the residue. The peak at about 100 cm −1 describes an in-plane fluctuation that increases the mobility of the residues in the region above the distal pocket. Similarly, a plot of the rotational motion ( Fig. 5d ) of His 64 uncovers a 120 cm −1 mode in the spectrum that is absent in the Mb–CO rotational spectrum. The presence of the 120 cm −1 rotational mode in the Mb–O 2 spectrum points to the motional flexibility of the portion of helix E in the region above His 64. And together the His 64 translational and rotational backbone motions specified in the spectra of the MD simulation of Mb–O 2 relate to the torsionally motivated expansion of the helical region around His 64 that was previously identified in the previous section. It is interesting to note that there is a hydrogen bond between O 2 and His 64 in Mb–O 2 that is not present when CO is bound to myoglobin. Fourier transform of the velocity autocorrelation of O 2 (not shown) compared with that of CO from the MD simulations suggests that the motion of O 2 (bound to the heme) may somehow be intertwined with the anharmonically coupled deformations observed in the protein low frequency collective motions that we are able to detect experimentally.

And together the His 64 translational and rotational backbone motions specified in the spectra of the MD simulation of Mb–O2 relate to the torsionally motivated expansion of the helical region around His 64 that was previously identified in the previous section.

Fourier transform of the velocity autocorrelation of O2 (not shown) compared with that of CO from the MD simulations suggests that the motion of O2 (bound to the heme) may somehow be intertwined with the anharmonically coupled deformations observed in the protein low frequency collective motions that we are able to detect experimentally.
From Soup: 55 In this investigation we have also extended the equilibrium MD simulations of myoglobin to include force distribution analyses (FDAs) 26,57 on the heme protein. The aim of these studies is to deduce the mechanical stress that is both distributed and propagated within the interior of the protein due to the heme-ligand interactions that take place within the protein active-site. It is believed that biomolecules exist in a range of closely related conformational states (or substates) and this is referred to as an ensemble. Allostery is a result of this ensemble. A perturbation, such as ligand binding, in the protein structure leads to a shift in the distribution of conformational states across the ensemble. 54 Thus, a return to equilibrium requires a release of the strain energy through a proteinquake . 58 In this quake-like motion excess energy is dissipated through the protein by means of propagating structural deformations. Therefore, allosteric signal propagation in proteins should be associated with small, conformational rearrangements rather than large-scale protein conformational changes. To comprehend the nature of the network of correlated protein fluctuations that arise in response to ligand binding (and accordingly, also form the basis of allosteric communication) we have conducted PCA on the residue averaged pair-wise forces in myoglobin bound to the two different ligands. Hence, the interpretation of the propagation pathways uncovered from FDA relies on the observations from force-PCA analyses. From the MD simulations, we are able to establish a network of interactions that propagate internal strain from the ligand-binding site to the rest of the protein via subtle, structural fluctuations. In Mb–CO the characteristics of these heme-induced structural fluctuations are quite distinct from those observed in Mb–O 2 . From the calculation of the changes of pair-wise forces from the Mb–CO simulation, we find that the heme interaction with the protein promotes two interconnected mechanisms of force propagation that lead to conformational rearrangements within the protein interior ( Fig. 6a and b ). The heme group exerts a direct strain on the protein through the covalently bound His 93 residue. The force from the direct contact with the heme molecule is disseminated through the protein as a torsional oscillation that promotes fluctuations in helix F (residues 89–96) and also induces oscillations in the C/D loop (residues 42–46) that intermittently positions the loop closer to the distal histidine. Consequently, this dynamic positioning of the C/D loop promotes a weak hydrogen-bond force that causes a dynamical reorganization within the H-bond network comprising residues from the C/D loop along with the distal pocket residues His 64, Thr 67, and Val 68. Additionally, we find that Thr 67 is frequently, directly H-bonded to CO during the course of the simulation, providing a direct link between the distal pocket residues and the ligand. Accordingly, there is a variation in the shape of the distal pocket cavity that is driven by the coupling of the C/D loop oscillation with the fluctuating H-bond network of the distal pocket residues and the ligand bound heme group. These network of intercorrelated fluctuations connecting the C/D loop, helix E, and helix F also leads to the formation of a transient cavity in the CO bound myoglobin structure. Particularly, strain on the distal portion of helix E, due to changes in pair wise forces originating from the heme dynamics within the protein binding pocket, results in a torque-induced rotational motion the of E/F loop towards helix F that opens a transient opening on the proximal side of the heme in the region shared by both helices F and G. The transient cavity forms as a consequence of structural defects in the inner core of the protein that arise in response to the correlated helical fluctuations that become coupled with the packing reorganization of side-chains of the residues Leu 89, Ile 101, and Leu 104.

The transient cavity forms as a consequence of structural defects in the inner core of the protein that arise in response to the correlated helical fluctuations that become coupled with the packing reorganization of side-chains of the residues Leu 89, Ile 101, and Leu 104.
From Soup: 56 Analogously, from the Mb–O 2 simulation we observe similar torsional oscillations in helix F that are associated with the direct bond between the heme and His 93 bond ( Fig. 6c and d ). With the exception of this similarity, the mechanism for force propagation within the protein when bound to O 2 seems to diverge significantly when contrasted with the protein bound to CO. One of the biggest differences in the samples is that the distal histidine (His 64) in Mb–O 2 is directly H-bonded to the O 2 ligand which seems to have significant ramifications on the types of motions propagated in the protein structure; and hence, also the chosen pathways for ligand induced signal propagation. The His 64-O 2 H-bond force (centered on the side-chains of Leu 61, Lys 63, and Val 66) leads to a softening of backbone atoms of Helix E near the distal pocket and the change in H-bond pair-wise forces is translated into an elongation (rigid bending) motion that extends throughout the upper part of the helix towards helix D and subsequently couples with the torsional oscillation of helix F. The segmental bending motion of helix E produces a strong torque near the center of the helix (near Thr 70 and Ala 71) that causes a prominent, localized, twisting motion of Gly 73 in the direction of helix G. The coupled motion of the torsional oscillation of helix F along with the localized, elongation mode of helix E promotes structural fluctuations in the hydrophobic core region separating helices G and H that engage the side-chains of Tyr 103, Phe 106, and Leu 137. Further, the effect of the bending motion of helix E also results in the disruption of the interstrand H-bonds between helix E and A that correspondingly promotes an increased rotational freedom in helix A. The increased torsional mobility of helix A permits the entire helix to shift in the direction of heme molecule (towards the protein hydrophobic core) which inadvertently compresses the A/B loop and modifies the side-chain packing of residues Ile 28 and Leu 29. The slight adjustment of helix A, which is dynamically linked to the constrained twisting motion of helix E, produces a transient packing defect in the protein core in the region separating helices A and G that foster fast, side-chain fluctuations of residues (Thr 70, Ala 71, and Leu 115).

From Soup: 57 We have used pair-wise force changes as a means to extrapolate pathways of allosteric signal propagation and dynamic allostery in myoglobin when bound to two distinctive ligands. We have previously observed differences in the dominant collective modes and thus, long-distance communication in the protein when bound by the contrasting ligands and these differences are further accentuated in the FDA investigation. The propagation of internal stress reveals a network of correlated, conformational rearrangements that ultimately transduce an external signal through the protein core to distant sites. The induced structural fluctuations, that are reasonably dissimilar for both of the ligand groups investigated, modify the inter-residue interactions as well as the connections between the transient cavities implying that the pathway toward binding and the reaction rate of ligand diffusion are directly tied with the ligand-specific mechanism of force propagation.

From Soup: 58 To understand the relationship between conserved and adaptable characteristics in the globin family, we have carried out PCA on the ensemble of structures from the MSA and utilized network analysis to examine trends in sequence evolution. Native ensembles of proteins within the same family provide information about the conserved, intrinsic dynamics within the set of conformations. Additionally, the top ranking modes convey information about the most accessible conformations within the ensemble of functional structures. It has been suggested that allosteric mechanisms are interconnected with the relative stabilities of conformational substates. In proteins, shifts in these populations have evolved to carry out specific functional roles. Therefore, slight modifications within the available conformations are expected to lead to variations in the globally encoded intrinsic fluctuations. In this view, allostery is a dynamic process that subsists in an equilibrium consisting of an ensemble of active and inactive conformational states. 59,60 For instance, it is now known that myoglobin, a single, prominent member in the globin family, is able to carry out at least two known functions: O 2 storage and catalysis for the conversion of NO to NO 3 − . For this reason, it is likely that the network of concerted, thermal fluctuations that we observe within the helical regions of the aligned globin sequences are connected with conserved interactions that permit sampling of the functional conformations within that ensemble. From the MSA and subsequent PCA of the aligned globin sequences, we find that approximately 92% of the available fluctuations are contained within the first two modes. These intrinsic modes are the ones that contribute most extensively to the correlated variation in the protein family. For instance, the fluctuations of the dominant intrinsic mode (72%) uncovered from the analysis of the dynamics of the aligned set of sequences presumably reflect a common functional motion related to binding and/or transporting of oxygen ( Fig. 7c ). The motion described by PC2 (20%) is much smaller in intensity when compared with that of PC1. And in this case, the collective dynamics point to a more intricate array of smaller scale fluctuations ( Fig. 7e ) that may reflect a secondary function within the class of proteins that correspondingly exploits a different long-distance communication pathway. Interestingly, we notice that PC1 from the aligned set of homologous sequences ( Fig. 7c ) bears a strong resemblance to the dominant FCA mode uncovered from the MD simulation of Mb–O 2 . The collective motion of PC1 is described by prominent in-phase fluctuations involving helix A, the E/F loop, and helix F that are coupled with out-of-phase fluctuations involving the C/D loop and regions of helix G ( Fig. 7d ). The concerted fluctuations afford an efficient pathway for O 2 transport within the protein structure. Coincidentally, the correlated groups of residues identified in PC2 are strongly reminiscent of the central FCA mode found in the MD simulations of Mb–CO. In this case, reduced-scale fluctuations mostly modulate the region that corresponds to the distal cavity in the related protein sequences.

From Soup: 59 Multiple sequence alignments of homologous proteins carry at least two distinctive forms of information. The first type, already discussed in the previous section, is the conservation of amino acids at certain positions in the protein family. The other is the interrelationship between two or more positions in the evolutionary network. Mutual Information (MI) from the information theory can be used to infer the extent of the coevolutionary relationship between two positions in a protein family. 28 MI is therefore often applied to predict positional correlations in an MSA with the intention of guiding the identification of structurally or functionally important positions in a given protein family. While highly conserved positions identify residues whose mutations are likely to disrupt the overall protein function, compensatory mutations often occur and are necessary for adaptation to new functional properties. Proteins that evolve from a common ancestor can change functionality over time. Consequently, the protein function could be described as a dynamic, evolving, landscape created by the interplay between the global, collective fluctuations encoded in the protein structure and the localized protein interactions that define specificity. Trends in correlated mutations in aligned sequences have the potential to reveal conserved allosteric signal pathways from a central location in the interior of the protein ( i.e. an enzyme active-site) out to distant sites in the rest of the molecule. It has been proposed that coevolved pairs characteristically have enhanced mobility 56 in the global modes and possess sequence adaptability that allows them to effectively function in defined tasks such as substrate binding and recognition. Using network analysis, 61 we have identified the shortest path 62,63 or the most efficient pathway of communication in the homologous protein sequences ( Fig. 8b ). The residues establishing the shortest path are composed of a combination of conserved residues joined with residues with intermediate sequence entropy. Together the coupled set of residues function to form an effective pathway through the protein hydrophobic core. It is interesting to note that although the shortest path has some variation in sequence when comparing all of the proteins included in the alignment, the general structure remains highly conserved (see ESI, Fig. S3 † ). In addition to the sequence dependent optimal path, there are many other preexisting pathways of communication that are resolved from the MI analysis that may also play a role in the function. Community analysis 64,65 reveals eight distinct sequence-dependent pathways for communication in the alignment of the globin sequences. Most of the pathways are relatively local in nature, but two in particular comprise a collective network of coevolved residue pairs that form specific pathways through the protein interior ( Fig. 9 ). Interestingly, these central pathways of allosteric communication share a striking resemblance to the allosteric networks uncovered with FDA in myoglobin bound to specific ligands. There is a remarkably strong correlation between the force distribution pattern stemming from the mechanical strain induced by the ligand bound active-site in myoglobin and the signal propagation mechanisms emerging from the examination of the evolutionary network of coevolved residue pairs in the globin family. We will exploit these correspondences as a means to interpret the relevance of the different communities in globin family protein functional dynamics. Accordingly, it is important to mention that in communities, nodes within the same community are highly connected and communicate with one another very efficiently but often in a localized manner, whereas nodes in different communities have fewer connections and require intermodular edges (or links) for creating long-distance or inter-community communication. Residues that form these links between communities are capable of altering a pathway from a suboptimal to an optimal path by establishing conduits of communication within the protein network. 62 Intermodular edge residues or residues that connect distant regions in the protein are composed of two distinct types of residues: highly conserved residues that are centrally located in the protein core and preserve the structure of the shortest path, and residues with high coevolution propensity that mediate enhanced signaling in the network. It is through these linker residues that a pathway is modified when a perturbation is introduced and their role in mediating specificity in molecular recognition has also been deliberated. 56,66–68 The first community (C1) consists of a number of nodes clustered on helix F of the myoglobin reference structure ( Fig. 9a ). Edges connect the nodes on helix F with a sparse number of nodes located on the C/D loop, helix E, and helix A. The network of connections creates a pathway that transects the active-site and presumably promotes structural fluctuations that modulate the region distal and proximal to the heme. Community 2 (C2) contains a number of conserved residues, namely Trp 14, Leu 29, His 64, and Leu 104, which are assumed to be functionally important ( Fig. 9b ). Additionally, C2 incorporates many residues that also make-up the shortest pathway in the protein family. Interestingly, overlaying C1 and C2 from the network analysis of the aligned globin sequences produces an allosteric network that is analogous to the FDA pattern identified in Mb–O 2 ( Fig. 6c and d ). Communication between these two communities relies on intermodular residues that link the two distinct groups. Particularly, Trp 14 appears to play a significant role in preserving the extended structure of the communication pathway. Previous investigations have indicated that Trp 14 fluctuations are tied with the transfer of excitation energy to the heme chromophore on a picosecond timescale. 69,70 And from the analysis of correlated fluctuations in Mb–O 2 carried out in this study, we observe that picosecond time-scale thermal modifications in the H-bond network in the helical region around Trp 14 is the kernel for enhancing long-range communication in the protein. In this case, the enhancement in signal propagation is accompanied by a sizeable torsional fluctuation involving Gly 73. Gly 73 is a residue that has high sequence variability in the structural alignment as well as considerable conformational mobility in the global modes, suggesting that its dynamics in the shortest path may be associated with movement that assists in the mechanism of intraprotein signal transduction by enhancing the long-range connection between the residues in the network. Analogously, Leu 61 is another residue that exhibits high correlated mutations and moderate sequence entropy over the MSA dataset considered and is also a contributing residue to the optimal pathway. Moreover, Leu 61 is found to link the two central communities in the globin network by maximizing connections in the immediate vicinity of the distal heme group. Again, relying on the analysis of the collective fluctuations in Mb–O 2 from previous sections to interpret the significance of this residue as a link between the communities, we recall that subnanosecond, localized H-bond variations involving Leu 61 have been found to lead to confined, anharmonic fluctuations that regulate the volume of the heme pocket. Hence, we postulate that the role of the residue as a link between the two network communities is to construct a positioned variable with structural adaptability that functions to form a specific, delimited network of associations that assists in substrate recognition and/or substrate stabilization.

From Soup: 60 In this section we have utilized an approach that incorporates models from network analysis along with experimental measurements to evaluate a specific class of allosteric proteins with the aim of gaining a fundamental understanding about how the protein structure and internal fluctuations potentially evolve to form allosteric networks. Preliminary results suggest that allosteric communication within the globin family comprises multiple pathways of communication that are characteristically tied with functional associations and dynamics. Particularly, we find that ligand binding may be the source of the diverse, altered routes of communication within the protein family and within these routes there are particular, key residues that have evolved to mediate signaling by means of coherent thermal fluctuations along the alternate pathways. Using prior computational studies conducted in this study on myoglobin as a guide for interpreting the evolved networks of the homologous protein family, we tentatively postulate that the most optimal route of communication in the protein sequences is directly tied with O 2 ligand binding; although, we have also detected less direct pathways of information flow in the protein interaction network.

From Soup: 61 It is interesting to consider how perturbation of key residues around linker residues may be tied with the disruption of long-range communication in the protein. There are a number of mutations in the protein sequences included in the MSA that are known to be important for binding and function. Many of the mutations in the globin family have been studied as a means of investigating the mechanism of ligand migration (mostly of CO) pathways in myoglobin; 7,9,11,40,71 less emphasis has been placed on the effect of the mutations on the protein intrinsic motions and consequent effect on the allosteric response to perturbation. Nonetheless, these standard mutations could also be used as means to alter the native networks in the protein sequences. To test this initial hypothesis, we measure the experimental THz spectrum of sperm-whale myoglobin bound to O 2 with the V68F mutation (a single point mutation, Mb–O 2 – V68F). What we observe is that the region sensitive to the protein global modes is highly perturbed with the mutation when compared with the WT spectrum ( Fig. 10a and c ), but the localized interactions in the protein appear to remain intact ( Fig. 10d ). It is not entirely clear what is happening from a mechanistic standpoint, but it is possible that the single mutation has altered both the population of intrinsic modes of the native protein state as well as the allosteric network that governs ligand binding. Relying on a network view of Val 68 from the MSA and its nearest neighbor interactions, we deduce that the residue (Val 68) has a number of connections to highly conserved residues that form the shortest path and an indirect connection to Trp 14 that has been conjectured to preserve the structure of the optimal pathway ( Fig. 11a ). It is possible that the mutation weakens interactions between key residues in myoglobin that reverberate as a destructive breakdown in the long-range communication within the protein. One intriguing proposition is that the structural modifications 42 that take place in the protein structure with mutation shift the communication between communities. We have observed from the dominant PCA mode of Mb–O 2 – V68F that despite the fact that there is very little collectivity associated with the motion of the mode, confined torsional motion close to the distal region of the heme nevertheless translates into fast, localized motion of the C/D loop. The C/D loop dynamics in the mutated protein sequence is uncorrelated with the dynamics of the rest of the protein. The main residues involved in the confined, uncorrelated motion include Thr 70, Lys 47, and His 48. In Fig. 11b we have mapped the connections between the two communities that correspond to the fluctuations that are induced in myoglobin with the V68F mutation. Most of the nodes of the two communities are clustered on helix E further supporting the supposition that the mutation leads to a disruption of the long-range communication within the protein but conserves local connections that support a modified dynamics of protein function. Clearly, more investigations need to be conducted in order to fully understand how small, perturbations of the allosteric network affect protein intrinsic, functional dynamics but preliminary measurements suggest that it is a relevant avenue of study.

From Soup: 62 In this work we have conducted preliminary investigations on myoglobin with the aim of providing additional insight into the equilibrium, collective thermal fluctuations in the protein that may be linked with the formation of ligand transition pathways and that may additionally form the basis for ligand discrimination. Using a combination of experimental and computational methods we have determined that myoglobin complexed with two distinctive ligands supports different low frequency motions that may be connected with the protein function. These protein thermal motions correspond to fluctuations that have a role in both selecting and sampling from the available protein intrinsic conformations that communicate function. By utilizing two different ligands as a mechanism for altering both the protein global modes and the subsequent allosteric response involving specific local interactions within the protein structure, we have used computational methods and experimental THz spectroscopy to characterize the observed protein changes. Using this joint approach we have been able to deduce that the allosteric effect is strongly determined by the type of bound ligand (ligand specificity). When binding O 2 , myoglobin possesses large-amplitude anharmonic motions that instigate changes in both the packing arrangement of residues in the hydrophobic core as well as modifications within localized hydrogen-bond networks. The localized motions form allosteric interactions that efficiently provide a pathway for ligand binding and escape. A subsequent computational approach utilizing MSA and sequence evolution has revealed an analogous set of coevolved pairs that have seemingly evolved across the protein subfamily to move O 2 in/out/around the protein structure. CO-binding on the other hand has disclosed a different allosteric response involving ligand binding. The local interactions that form in the protein structure with CO mostly modulate the region around the distal pocket of myoglobin and the amplitude of fluctuations describing both the global and localized interactions of the excitation remain rather small in scale when compared with Mb–O 2 . We conjecture that the network of interactions that are excited upon CO-binding follow a suboptimal allosteric pathway detected from the sequence evolution patterns.

From cou.: 63 In this work we have conducted preliminary investigations on myoglobin with the aim of providing additional insight into the equilibrium, collective thermal fluctuations in the protein that may be linked with the formation of ligand transition pathways and that may additionally form the basis for ligand discrimination. Using a combination of experimental and computational methods we have determined that myoglobin complexed with two distinctive ligands supports different low frequency motions that may be connected with the protein function. These protein thermal motions correspond to fluctuations that have a role in both selecting and sampling from the available protein intrinsic conformations that communicate function. By utilizing two different ligands as a mechanism for altering both the protein global modes and the subsequent allosteric response involving specific local interactions within the protein structure, we have used computational methods and experimental THz spectroscopy to characterize the observed protein changes. Using this joint approach we have been able to deduce that the allosteric effect is strongly determined by the type of bound ligand (ligand specificity). When binding O2, myoglobin possesses large-amplitude anharmonic motions that instigate changes in both the packing arrangement of residues in the hydrophobic core as well as modifications within localized hydrogen-bond networks. The localized motions form allosteric interactions that efficiently provide a pathway for ligand binding and escape. A subsequent computational approach utilizing MSA and sequence evolution has revealed an analogous set of coevolved pairs that have seemingly evolved across the protein subfamily to move O2 in/out/around the protein structure. CO-binding on the other hand has disclosed a different allosteric response involving ligand binding. The local interactions that form in the protein structure with CO mostly modulate the region around the distal pocket of myoglobin and the amplitude of fluctuations describing both the global and localized interactions of the excitation remain rather small in scale when compared with Mb–O2. We conjecture that the network of interactions that are excited upon CO-binding follow a suboptimal allosteric pathway detected from the sequence evolution patterns.
