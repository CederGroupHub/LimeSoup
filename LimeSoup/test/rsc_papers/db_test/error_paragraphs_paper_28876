From cou.: 1 Photophysical properties and photochemistry of various substituted cinnamates and cinnamic acids for ultraviolet B blocking were investigated experimentally and theoretically. This series includes monohydroxy, -nitro, and -fluoro derivatives. The absorption spectra were satisfactorily reproduced by the direct SAC-CI method with respect to the peak position and intensity. The transition character of the low-lying two ππ* and σπ* states for these 18 derivatives was analyzed. The para derivatives have a different transition character of the ππ* transitions compared with those of the ortho and meta derivatives. To elucidate the relaxation mechanism, the emission spectra were observed with oxygen quenching and the photostability was examined experimentally. The calculated radiative lifetimes indicate that the ortho- and meta-substituted derivatives have longer lifetimes for emission than the para derivatives. The potential energy curves of the first and second singlet excited states of the hydroxy derivatives as well as the vertical singlet and triplet transitions were examined to investigate the relaxation qualitatively. The ortho and meta derivatives have an energy barrier or flat surface in S1 resulting in fluorescence, whereas the para derivatives show nonradiative decay without an energy barrier. The para-hydroxy derivative was found to be an excellent UV absorber based on its broad absorption in the UVB/UVA regions, less emission, and higher photostability.

From cou.: 2 Cinnamic acids and their derivatives can be found in many plant products such as foods, medicines, and cosmetics.1,2 Moreover, the ester derivatives of cinnamic acid also act as optical active molecules in liquid crystal devices. Light induced cis–trans isomerization of olefins is a major area of interest in modern photochemical research. Photochemistry of these compounds can be utilized in a variety of applications, such as optoelectronics, storage devices, and light-driven molecular switches.3–6 Recently, there has been considerable interest in the photophysical properties and photochemistry of 4-methoxycinnamic acid and 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate; both have been widely used as ultraviolet B (UVB) blocking compounds in cosmetic sunscreens.7–9 However, photostability studies on the derivatives of cinnamate and cinnamic acid showed that they decompose into other compounds when exposed to ultraviolet radiation.10–14 The photochemistry of this process has also been studied, and the involvement of an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state resulting from a rotation at the carbon–carbon double bond has been recognized.15,16

From cou.: 4 To improve the UVB blocking function and photostability of cinnamate derivatives, chemical modification is necessary. However, only a few studies have reported the effects of substituents at the para position. Ishigami et al.23 reported the cis–trans photoisomerization and relaxation of methyl cinnamate for some para-derivatives, but did not address the photostability.24 In our previous studies, we investigated the photophysical properties of cis and trans isomers of the methoxy-substituted 2-ethylhexylcinnamates at various positions on an aromatic ring experimentally25 and their model compounds theoretically.26 Recently, we also theoretically studied the photophysical properties of the cinnamates and cinnamic acids with hydroxy, nitro, and fluoro substitutions using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Time-Dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations.27 However, there were some deviations from experimental results, and the calculated spectra were not satisfactory for the definitive assignments and the detailed discussion on the difference in spectrum between the different derivatives. Thus, further theoretical work based on accurate wave function theory is necessary for understanding the details of photophysical properties and to provide reliable information for molecular design. Theoretical studies of the photochemistry and photostability of these compounds are also important, especially for cis–trans photoisomerization in the relaxation pathways.

From cou.: 6 In this work, we investigated the photophysical properties and photochemistry of the monohydroxy-, -nitro-, and -fluoro-substituted cinnamates (1E–9E) and cinnamic acids (1A–9A) substituted at the ortho, meta, and para positions, as shown in Fig. 1. In particular, we are interested in the substitution effects of the electron-donating (hydroxy) and electron-withdrawing (nitro and fluoro) groups at three positions on the photoabsorption and photostability aiming at the fine chemical modification. The absorption and fluorescence spectra were observed for all the derivatives and detailed assignments were performed by the direct SAC-CI method over a wide energy range. The measurement of molar extinction coefficient provides the direct comparison of UVB/UVA blocking performance. The present reliable theoretical results enabled the discussion on the differences in absorption spectra among these derivatives with various substitutions. The relaxation in the excited state was examined by the fluorescence measurement including oxygen quenching and the photostability by UVB irradiation. The cis−trans photoisomerization pathways that lead to the nonradiative decay were also investigated. Based on the comprehensive analysis, effective substitution in the cinnamate derivatives was proposed.

From cou.: 7 All trans-cinnamic acids were synthesized using the Knoevenagel–Doebner condensation between substituted benzaldehydes and malonic acid in the presence of piperidine as a catalyst (Scheme 1).34,35 Only the synthesis of 2-hydroxycinnamic acid (1A) failed and the commercial product was used: the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and the carbonyl group decreases the reactivity of the carbonyl group of the aldehyde. All trans-cinnamates were then prepared by esterification between trans-cinnamoyl chloride, which was prepared in situ from cinnamic acids, oxalylchloride, and 2-ethylhexanol (Scheme 1).36 Synthetic procedures and the NMR characterization of the various substituted cinnamic acids and cinnamates are available in the ESI.†

From cou.: 10 To investigate the functions of the UVB blocking molecules, the low-lying two ππ* and one nπ* excited states were calculated for the substituted methyl cinnamates (1E–9E) and cinnamic acids (1A–9A). These model compounds were investigated without losing the essence of the excitations; the π conjugation relevant for electronic excitation can be described well with these models and the side alkyl chain does not affect the photophysical property so much. The ground state geometries were fully optimized without restricting the symmetry using the B3LYP37,38/6-31G(d)39 method. On the other hand, the optimization of the first ππ* excited-state geometries was performed while restricting the planar structure as Cs symmetry using the CIS/D95(d)40 method except for ortho-nitro-substituted derivatives. Based on the S0- and S1-state geometries, the vertical absorption and emission energies were calculated using the SAC-CI/D95(d) method.

From cou.: 12 To examine the pathway of nonradiative relaxation in the excited states, the PECs of the singlet excited states (S1 and S2), both of which could be involved by UVB absorption (280–320 nm), were calculated for 1E, 2E, and 3E along the torsion angle ω(C3–C7C9–C11). These S1 and S2 PECs were calculated using the CIS(D)/6-31G(d)//CIS/6-31G(d) calculations; namely, the CIS/6-31G(d) partial optimization in which the torsion angle ω was fixed with all the other coordinates optimized followed by the CIS(D)/6-31G(d) calculations. Triplet excited states may also be involved in the relaxation and they are actually observed in oxygen quenching. Therefore, vertical transition energies of triplet excited states (T1 and T2) were also calculated by CIS(D)/6-31G(d) at the ground state geometries.

From cou.: 14 First, we discuss the ground (S0)- and excited (ππ*, S1)-state geometries. Although the local minimum of the nπ* state is located below that of the ππ* state in the cinnamate, the fluorescence from the ππ* excited state is considered. Eight substituted methyl cinnamates and eight substituted cinnamic acids except for the ortho-nitro substituted derivatives 4E and 4A have their local minimum at the coplanar structure in both the S0 and S1 states because of the π-conjugation. The ortho-nitro-substituted derivatives have non-planar structures as discussed in the ESI.† A comparison of the bond lengths along the π-conjugation between the S0- and S1-state geometries of 1E–9E is shown in Fig. 2, while those of 1A–9A are shown in Fig. S1.† The detailed molecular structures of 1E–9E and 1A–9A are given in Fig. S2 and S3,† respectively.

From cou.: 15 Based on the geometry changes, the ππ* excitation of the hydroxy-, nitro-, and fluoro-substituted derivatives of both methyl cinnamates and cinnamic acids is localized in the central unit, except for the nitro substituted at the ortho and para positions of methyl cinnamates (4E, 6E) and cinnamic acids (4A, 6A). For example, in the 1E derivative, the changes in carbon–carbon (C–C) bond lengths are Δr = +0.044, +0.038, −0.062, and +0.054 Å for C2–C3, C3–C4, C3–C7, and C7–C9, respectively. In general, the C2–C3, C3–C4, C1–C6, and C7–C9 bond lengths increase and the lengths of the other bonds decrease in the first ππ* excited state compared with those in the ground state. The derivatives with a nitro group at the ortho or para positions, on the other hand, have a moderate change in C–N bond length between the S0- and S1-state geometries. In the 4E and 6E derivatives of methyl cinnamates, for instance, the changes in C–N bond length are Δr = −0.050 and −0.043 Å, respectively, and those of 4A and 6A of cinnamic acids are Δr = −0.048 and −0.043 Å, respectively. The geometry change of these ortho- and para-derivatives reflects the bonding nature of LUMO in the C–N bond, while the change is not so large in meta-derivatives. This geometry change can be understood by the character of HOMO and LUMO because the ππ* excitation is predominantly described as the H–L (HOMO–LUMO) transition. The HOMO and LUMO of all the derivatives are shown in Fig. S4 and S5.†

From Soup: 35 We discuss the absorption spectra in the gas phase and in methanol solution for 1E–9E and 1A–9A compared with the experimental absorption spectra in methanol solution. In general, the absorption spectra of all compounds were reproduced reasonably well by the SAC-CI method in both peak position and intensity. The excitation energies in solution are in better agreement with the experimental data, although the PCM is not satisfactory for protic solvents. The theoretical spectra show that the two π–π* transitions in the para -substituted compounds have a relatively small splitting between two peaks compared with those in the ortho - and meta -substituted compounds.

From Soup: 36 The experimental spectra of ortho -hydroxy cinnamate ( 1E ) and cinnamic acid ( 1A ) show two distinct absorption bands. The SAC-CI spectra also have two peaks with large oscillator strengths. These peaks are attributed to the combination of the H → L and H−1 → L (next HOMO to LUMO) transitions. The absorption spectrum of 1E , for example, has its lowest peak centered at 332 nm (3.73 eV). Accordingly, the calculated value is 323 nm (3.84 eV) for the gas phase and 341 nm (3.63 eV) in solution. The second peak was observed at 280 nm (4.43 eV) in comparison with the calculated peak at 285 nm (4.35 eV) in solution. The solvent effects of these states range from −0.20 to −0.15 eV. On the higher energy side, a weak shoulder is observed and this shoulder is attributed to the nπ* transition. The calculated oscillator strength of this transition in the planar structure is nearly zero and intensity borrowing occurs via vibronic coupling. The solvent effect of this state gives a blue shift of the peak. The dipole moment of the nπ* state is smaller than that of the ground state ( Table 1 ) and the blue shift therefore occurs in the polar solvent.

From Soup: 37 The meta -hydroxy derivatives ( 2E , 2A ) have a single strong absorption band with asymmetric shoulders. The SAC-CI calculation also gives two ππ* transitions with a single strong peak and a shoulder on the lower-energy side and one nπ* transition. Unlike the ortho derivative, the small oscillator strength of the lower ππ* peak is attributed to the cancellation of the transition moment of the H → L and H−1 → L components with almost the same weight. The oscillator strength of the lower peak reduces drastically in methanol solution. The SAC-CI calculations reproduced the experimental values satisfactorily: two ππ* transitions were calculated at 3.83 and 4.42 eV in solution, which are comparable with the observed values of 3.82 and 4.35 eV, respectively.

From cou.: 38 a
From Soup: 38 The absorption spectra of the para -hydroxy compounds ( 3E , 3A ) consist of a single broad absorption band in contrast to the ortho and meta derivatives. The SAC-CI calculations predicted two close peaks for these para -derivatives and reproduced the experimental feature. The transition characters of these states are also different from the ortho and meta derivatives: two ππ* transitions are the combinations of H → L and H → L+2 transitions. This is similar to the trend in the absorption spectra of the methoxy cinnamates, as reported in our previous work. The spectra including the solvent effect differ from the experimental results. Note that the transition characters of these states by TD-CAM-B3LYP are different from those by SAC-CI. We ascribed the deviation from experiment in solution to this difference in the theoretical results. The absorption spectra of all hydroxy cinnamic acids ( 1A–3A ) are similar in shape to the corresponding cinnamates ( 1E–3E ).
 ###### 
From cou.: 39 We discuss the absorption spectra in the gas phase and in methanol solution for 1E–9E and 1A–9A compared with the experimental absorption spectra in methanol solution. In general, the absorption spectra of all compounds were reproduced reasonably well by the SAC-CI method in both peak position and intensity. The excitation energies in solution are in better agreement with the experimental data, although the PCM is not satisfactory for protic solvents. The theoretical spectra show that the two π–π* transitions in the para-substituted compounds have a relatively small splitting between two peaks compared with those in the ortho- and meta-substituted compounds.
From Soup: 39 Next, we turn to absorption spectra of nitro cinnamates ( 4E–6E ) and cinnamic acids ( 4A–6A ). The molecular geometry and its effect on the absorption spectra of nitro derivatives with respect to the angle of the NO 2 group are discussed in detail in the ESI. † For these molecules, the σ-electron-withdrawing and the π-electron-donating character of the nitro group is of interest. The shoulder absorption at ca . 310 nm of ortho -( 4A ) and para -( 6A ) cinnamic acids disappeared after the compound was esterified into cinnamate, whereas the shoulder absorption of the meta -nitro compounds ( 5E , 5A ) remained. The strong ππ* transition of these derivatives is located above 280 nm in the higher UVB region. In the nitro derivatives, five low-lying excited states were found, namely, two ππ* and three nπ* transitions. The calculated spectra of the ortho and meta compounds show a single strong absorption band in the higher energy region with a shoulder on the lower-energy side that agrees well with the experimental spectra. For example, in 4A , the strong absorption peak was calculated at 4.44 eV in solution, which is comparable with the observed value of 4.41 eV. On the other hand, the spectra of para compounds ( 6E , 6A ) show a single absorption band observed at 4.40 and 4.08 eV, respectively, and the peak of 6E is much lower than those of 4E and 5E . The lower ππ* transition of 4E is almost not observed; only a weak shoulder overlaps. The ortho -nitro compound is not planar at both the nitro group and the propenyl group in the S 0 state. The absorption of the lower ππ* transition at non-planar structure is weaker than that at planar structure as shown in the ESI, † which might be responsible for the single absorption peak nature of 4E considering the thermal distribution of various conformations.

From Soup: 40 Finally, we focus on the absorption spectra of the fluoro derivatives of cinnamates ( 7E–9E ) and cinnamic acids ( 7A–9A ). All cinnamates show a single absorption band with its maximum at ca . 280 nm, while those of all cinnamic acids are at ca . 270 nm. The strong peak with large oscillator strength is attributed to the H → L transitions. Compared with the hydroxy and nitro derivatives, the separation of the two ππ* transitions of the fluoro derivatives is narrow and the SAC-CI spectra reproduce this feature. The trend of absorption spectra in different substitution positions was also reproduced; the transition energies of the strong absorption peak for 7E , 8E , and 9E were calculated at 4.44, 4.46, and 4.47 eV, which are comparable with the observed values at 4.31, 4.37, and 4.44 eV, respectively. The absorption spectra of all fluoro cinnamic acids ( 7A–9A ) are similar to those of corresponding cinnamates ( 7E–9E ).

From Soup: 41 The comparison between SAC-CI and TD-DFT results is done in the ESI † (Tables S3 and S4 † ) for all the derivatives. The agreement between SAC-CI and experiment is better than that of TD-DFT on average. For some derivatives, the shape of the theoretical spectrum and the ππ* peak splitting are very different between SAC-CI and TD-DFT (B3LYP); for example, 3E (peak splitting), 4E , 8E , and 9E (spectrum shape). Note that agreement with the experiment of B3LYP is better than that of CAM-B3LYP for these molecules. 27 This indicates that calculations with accurate wave function theory are necessary for reliable analysis and assignments of the absorption spectrum in the present case.

From cou.: 42 The absorption spectra of the para-hydroxy compounds (3E, 3A) consist of a single broad absorption band in contrast to the ortho and meta derivatives.

From Soup: 42 The experimental and SAC-CI absorption energies of the hydroxy, nitro, and fluoro cinnamates are compared in Fig. 4 . The experimental peak positions are shown as black vertical lines and the SAC-CI values are shown as red vertical lines for only the ππ* excited states. The SAC-CI values are those in methanol solution. In general, the agreement between experiment and SAC-CI is satisfactory for both the peak position and the energy separation of the ππ* excited states. The energy difference ΔΔ E (ππ*) of the lower and higher ππ* excited states is large in the ortho derivatives: ΔΔ E (ππ*, ortho ) > ΔΔ E (ππ*, meta ) > ΔΔ E (ππ*, para ). The trends in energy difference in different substitutions are also clear, ΔΔ E (ππ*, hydroxy) > ΔΔ E (ππ*, nitro) > ΔΔ E (ππ*, fluoro). These trends are in good agreement with experimental observations. The hydroxy derivatives have clearly separated absorption peaks and cover the UVB (280–320 nm) and UVA (320–400 nm) regions.
 ###### 
From cou.: 43 Next, we turn to absorption spectra of nitro cinnamates (4E–6E) and cinnamic acids (4A–6A). The molecular geometry and its effect on the absorption spectra of nitro derivatives with respect to the angle of the NO2 group are discussed in detail in the ESI.† For these molecules, the σ-electron-withdrawing and the π-electron-donating character of the nitro group is of interest. The shoulder absorption at ca. 310 nm of ortho-(4A) and para-(6A) cinnamic acids disappeared after the compound was esterified into cinnamate, whereas the shoulder absorption of the meta-nitro compounds (5E, 5A) remained. The strong ππ* transition of these derivatives is located above 280 nm in the higher UVB region. In the nitro derivatives, five low-lying excited states were found, namely, two ππ* and three nπ* transitions.

The lower ππ* transition of 4E is almost not observed; only a weak shoulder overlaps. The ortho-nitro compound is not planar at both the nitro group and the propenyl group in the S0 state. The absorption of the lower ππ* transition at non-planar structure is weaker than that at planar structure as shown in the ESI,† which might be responsible for the single absorption peak nature of 4E considering the thermal distribution of various conformations.
From Soup: 43 Finally, we compare the dipole moments of the ground and excited states to interpret the solvent effect on absorption spectra qualitatively. They are given in Tables 1 and S1 † for methyl cinnamates ( 1E–9E ) and cinnamic acids ( 1A–9A ), respectively. For all the compounds studied here, the calculated dipole moments ( μ ) of the excited states are much larger in the A′ state and smaller in the A′′ state than those in the ground (XA′) state. In the A′′ state, a lone pair electron is promoted to the distributed π* orbital, which reduces the dipole moment, while in the A′ state, charge polarization is enhanced by the ππ* transition. These are the origin of the solvent effect in which the absorption peaks of the ππ* states show a red shift, whereas those of the nπ* state show a blue shift in methanol solution compared with those in the gas phase for both methyl cinnamates and cinnamic acids.
 ###### 
From cou.: 44 Finally, we focus on the absorption spectra of the fluoro derivatives of cinnamates (7E–9E) and cinnamic acids (7A–9A). All cinnamates show a single absorption band with its maximum at ca. 280 nm, while those of all cinnamic acids are at ca. 270 nm. The strong peak with large oscillator strength is attributed to the H → L transitions. Compared with the hydroxy and nitro derivatives, the separation of the two ππ* transitions of the fluoro derivatives is narrow and the SAC-CI spectra reproduce this feature. The trend of absorption spectra in different substitution positions was also reproduced; the transition energies of the strong absorption peak for 7E, 8E, and 9E were calculated at 4.44, 4.46, and 4.47 eV, which are comparable with the observed values at 4.31, 4.37, and 4.44 eV, respectively. The absorption spectra of all fluoro cinnamic acids (7A–9A) are similar to those of corresponding cinnamates (7E–9E).
From Soup: 44 The emission spectra of the substituted cinnamates ( 1E–9E ) and cinnamic acids ( 1A–9A ) were observed in acetonitrile solution. In observing the emission spectra, the absorbance at the excitation wavelength was kept constant (0.1) at the maximum absorption wavelength for all the sample solutions; for example, 1E was excited at 273 and 322 nm and 2E at 278 and 320 nm in acetonitrile solution. This condition represents the absorption of light in the UVB region. For 1E , 2E , 1A and 2A , the emission spectra with the excitation at higher and lower peaks are shown in the ESI. † For UVB absorbers, the strong emission is not a desirable property. The emission spectra of 1E–9E in aerobic condition and in N 2 gas are compared in Fig. 5 , while those of 1A–9A are in Fig. S7. † Note that the emission of 2E and 2A is much stronger than that of nitro- and fluoro-derivatives, and therefore the observed condition for 2E and 2A is different from other derivatives (see also Fig. S8 and S9 † ).
 ###### 
From cou.: 45 The comparison between SAC-CI and TD-DFT results is done in the ESI† (Tables S3 and S4†) for all the derivatives. The agreement between SAC-CI and experiment is better than that of TD-DFT on average. For some derivatives, the shape of the theoretical spectrum and the ππ* peak splitting are very different between SAC-CI and TD-DFT (B3LYP); for example, 3E (peak splitting), 4E, 8E, and 9E (spectrum shape). Note that agreement with the experiment of B3LYP is better than that of CAM-B3LYP for these molecules.27 This indicates that calculations with accurate wave function theory are necessary for reliable analysis and assignments of the absorption spectrum in the present case.
From Soup: 45 Emissions were clearly detected in some cinnamates and cinnamic acids. The effect of the substituent position is different among hydroxy, nitro, and fluoro derivatives. For example, in hydroxy derivatives, meta -hydroxy derivative ( 2E ) shows considerable emission compared with the para derivative ( 3E ). This is related to the lifetime of the excited states and, more in detail, the energy barrier to the conical intersection leading to nonradiative decay, as discussed in the next section. In the presence of oxygen in the solution (black line in Fig. 5 ), no strong emissions from cinnamates and cinnamic acids with fluoro or nitro substituents were observed. To see the effect of oxygen quenching, the emission under N 2 gas was also examined. The emission intensities of some cinnamates and cinnamic acids increased under N 2 gas significantly (red line in Fig. 5 ). This means that 4E and 5E (and 8A and 9A ) are significantly quenched and 3E in part, while other compounds are not quenched so much. Despite the existence of an electron-withdrawing group in esters, 6E , 7E , and 8E , for example, the emissions of those compounds were almost not quenched by oxygen. These results indicate that the triplet excited state is generated in some derivatives with an electron-withdrawing group; however, it depends on the position of substitution. Namely, after the excitations to the S 1 or S 2 states, the relaxation to the T 2 state occurs in the molecules which show drastic changes in emission under oxygen quenching (photoisomerization). On the other hand, in the derivatives with an electron-donating group such as para -hydroxy derivatives, the relaxation seems to take place via a singlet state as also observed in a previous study. 24 The emission or relaxation via triplet state also depends on the lifetime of the excited species. Further time-resolved analysis is necessary for understanding the relaxation in the excited states, in particular for the derivatives where the triplet state is involved in the relaxation process.

From cou.: 46 The experimental and SAC-CI absorption energies of the hydroxy, nitro, and fluoro cinnamates are compared in Fig. 4. The experimental peak positions are shown as black vertical lines and the SAC-CI values are shown as red vertical lines for only the ππ* excited states. The SAC-CI values are those in methanol solution. In general, the agreement between experiment and SAC-CI is satisfactory for both the peak position and the energy separation of the ππ* excited states. The energy difference ΔΔE(ππ*) of the lower and higher ππ* excited states is large in the ortho derivatives: ΔΔE(ππ*, ortho) > ΔΔE(ππ*, meta) > ΔΔE(ππ*, para). The trends in energy difference in different substitutions are also clear, ΔΔE(ππ*, hydroxy) > ΔΔE(ππ*, nitro) > ΔΔE(ππ*, fluoro). These trends are in good agreement with experimental observations. The hydroxy derivatives have clearly separated absorption peaks and cover the UVB (280–320 nm) and UVA (320–400 nm) regions.
From Soup: 46 The emission energies of the substituted methyl cinnamate and cinnamic acid derivatives were also calculated by the SAC-CI/D95(d) method at their CIS excited state (ππ*, S 1 )-optimized structures. The calculated emission energies in methanol, oscillator strength ( f ), radiative lifetime ( τ ), and dipole moment ( μ ) of the methyl cinnamates are summarized in Table 2 and those of the cinnamic acids are given in Table S2. † The SAC-CI emission peaks for the para position of all compounds show the highest oscillator strengths, in the range of 0.579–0.832. These oscillator strengths do not directly correlate to the emission strength because non-adiabatic decay competes with emission, particularly for para derivatives. The transition probabilities for emissions of various substituted cinnamic acids and methyl cinnamates have been observed with the peak maximum at 1A′ corresponding to the H → L transition. Note that ortho -nitro derivatives ( 4E and 4A ) are also planar in the S 1 state. However, the observed emission bands are sometimes very broad and it is not easy to analyze the details; therefore, we focus only on the radiative lifetime.

Long radiative lifetimes were calculated for the meta derivatives, for example, those for meta -hydroxy ( 2E ) and meta -nitro ( 5E ) methyl cinnamates were 6.23 and 7.59 ns, respectively. The radiative lifetimes of the para compounds are slightly shorter than those of the other compounds.

From Soup: 53 Photostability is a desirable property for various applications of photofunctional materials or compounds such as for sunscreen. The UV absorbers used in cosmetics must be photochemically inert. If they are not, chemical bonds may be rearranged, leading to decomposition; the absorbance of the resulting compounds might be diminished or even lost. The photostability of each compound was examined by the relative absorbance at the maximum absorption wavelength of the compound. The photostability ( S ) was evaluated as where I irr and I unirr denote absorbance of irradiated and unirradiated samples, respectively, observed at the maximum absorption wavelength of each compound. The photostability was examined after 5, 10, and 30 min of irradiation and is displayed in Fig. 6 . The photoabsorptions of trans and cis isomers are assumed to be similar as shown for methoxy cinnmates. 26 In view of photostability, the trans − cis isomerization does not matter because interchange between these isomers occurs and those two isomers work as a suitable UVB/UVA absorber. For a more detailed analysis of photostability, the measurements of the decomposed products and the cis isomer were done as discussed later.

From cou.: 54 f
From Soup: 54 Among all cinnamates with hydroxy, nitro, and fluoro substituents, meta -substituted derivatives showed better photostability than the corresponding para - and ortho -substituted derivatives. In particular, meta -hydroxy cinnamate ( 2E ) and meta -nitro cinnamate ( 5E ) showed significant photostability. Generally, the derivatives containing the hydroxy group were more photostable than cinnamates containing nitro and fluoro groups. However, this photostability should be carefully evaluated for the desired performance as a UVB absorber, because meta derivatives show strong emission and decay to the ground state by emission. Thus, the decomposition in the course of nonradiative decay would be small in meta derivatives and the apparent photostability of these compounds is better than others. For example, 2E shows strong emission and 5E has less absorption in the UVB and UVA regions. The fluoro cinnamates ( 7E–9E ) show less photostability than hydroxy and nitro substituents. Thus, para -hydroxy cinnamate ( 3E ) would be an excellent UVB absorber with respect to photostability and photoabsorption.
 ###### 
From cou.: 55 The predicted radiative lifetimes of the present molecules are collected in Tables 2 and S2.† The direct comparison of the calculated f or τ with the experimental emission intensity is not straightforward due to some possible relaxation processes. Long radiative lifetimes were calculated for the meta derivatives, for example, those for meta-hydroxy (2E) and meta-nitro (5E) methyl cinnamates were 6.23 and 7.59 ns, respectively. The radiative lifetimes of the para compounds are slightly shorter than those of the other compounds. For the hydroxy substituent, the predicted radiative lifetimes are in the order of the meta-, ortho-, and para-substituted compounds. These results are similar to the trend in fluorescence lifetimes of the methoxy cinnamates, as reported in a previous experimental study.25
From Soup: 55 A detailed analysis of hydroxycinnamate at ortho ( 1E ), meta ( 2E ), and para ( 3E ) positions before and after light irradiation was done using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as shown in Fig. S13. † HPLC revealed a new peak and therefore indicated an accumulation of some decomposed products. These results qualitatively agree with the above UV irradiation experiment. We also examined the possible transformation of trans ortho -hydroxy cinnamic acid ( 1A ) to cis -isomer and its cyclization to coumarin. The identification of the mixture obtained after photoirradiation for 1A was done by HPLC-MS and NMR as shown in the ESI (Fig. S14−S16 † ). We observe a small amount of decomposed products such as styrene and cinnamic acid. The NMR result shows that the probability of photo-isomerization of 1A into cis isomer by UV irradiation is small (Fig. S16 † ).

From Soup: 56 The relaxation processes in the excited states are important for UV-blocking molecules. One possible relaxation is a nonradiative decay via the conical intersection or the nπ* state. 21,22 The emission or radiative decay competes with the nonradiative decay to the ground state. We focus here on the former relaxation pathway via the conical intersection. As discussed above, theoretical radiative lifetime is dependent on the substituent and also its position. This means that the ratio of the radiative to nonradiative decay varies among the compounds. For example, the radiative decay of ortho and meta compounds is slower than that of para compounds in the theoretical results.

From cou.: 57 Among all cinnamates with hydroxy, nitro, and fluoro substituents, meta-substituted derivatives showed better photostability than the corresponding para- and ortho-substituted derivatives. In particular, meta-hydroxy cinnamate (2E) and meta-nitro cinnamate (5E) showed significant photostability. Generally, the derivatives containing the hydroxy group were more photostable than cinnamates containing nitro and fluoro groups. However, this photostability should be carefully evaluated for the desired performance as a UVB absorber, because meta derivatives show strong emission and decay to the ground state by emission. Thus, the decomposition in the course of nonradiative decay would be small in meta derivatives and the apparent photostability of these compounds is better than others. For example, 2E shows strong emission and 5E has less absorption in the UVB and UVA regions. The fluoro cinnamates (7E–9E) show less photostability than hydroxy and nitro substituents. Thus, para-hydroxy cinnamate (3E) would be an excellent UVB absorber with respect to photostability and photoabsorption.
From Soup: 57 Hydroxy cinnamates show a relatively better UVB blocking performance than nitro and fluoro compounds with regard to absorption and photostability. The emission strength is very different among three hydroxy derivatives. Thus, we concentrate here on the nonradiative relaxation of hydroxy derivatives and examine the relevant cis – trans isomerization at the propenyl double bond. The S 1 and S 2 PECs along the torsion angle ω (C 3 –C 7 C 9 –C 11 ) were calculated for the hydroxy methyl cinnamates ( 1E–3E ). Many internal coordinates would also contribute to the relaxation process. The PECs were calculated by CIS(D)/6-31G(d)//CIS/6-31G(d) calculations using the partial optimization for torsion angles ( ω = 0°−40° and 140°−180°) with all the other coordinates being optimized. The calculated S 1 and S 2 PECs are shown in Fig. 7 . The vertical absorption energy levels of the S 1 , S 2 and T 2 states are also shown in the figure except for the T 1 state which is located much below (about 3.5 eV). From the oxygen-quenching experiment, the relaxation predominantly occurs via a singlet S 1 excited state for hydroxy cinnamates. The energy barrier ( ω = 180–140°) to the conical intersection, which we can evaluate properly by the present method, is an important factor in the relaxation process.
 ###### 
From cou.: 58 A detailed analysis of hydroxycinnamate at ortho (1E), meta (2E), and para (3E) positions before and after light irradiation was done using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as shown in Fig. S13.† HPLC revealed a new peak and therefore indicated an accumulation of some decomposed products. These results qualitatively agree with the above UV irradiation experiment. We also examined the possible transformation of trans ortho-hydroxy cinnamic acid (1A) to cis-isomer and its cyclization to coumarin. The identification of the mixture obtained after photoirradiation for 1A was done by HPLC-MS and NMR as shown in the ESI (Fig. S14−S16†). We observe a small amount of decomposed products such as styrene and cinnamic acid. The NMR result shows that the probability of photo-isomerization of 1A into cis isomer by UV irradiation is small (Fig. S16†).
From Soup: 58 In all cases, the trans structures ( ω = 180°) are more stable than the cis structures ( ω = 0°), as also seen in previous reports. We consider here the photoexcitation and subsequent relaxation from the trans structure. After photoexcitation, the cinnamates in the S 1 state lead to the conical intersection with torsion at the propenyl double bond. For the ortho compound ( 1E ), the S 1 PEC is almost flat with a very low energy barrier to conical intersection, which may also lead to radiative decay with fluorescence. No energy barrier was found for the para compound ( 3E ) and nonradiative decay would occur via conical intersection. For meta compound ( 2E ), the S 1 PEC has a large energy barrier so that the nonradiative decay is strongly prohibited and it leads to a strong emission. These results qualitatively match with the emission spectra in Fig. 5 . These results also agree with recent studies of the hydroxy and methoxy derivatives. 22,26 Since the present CIS(D) calculations remain in qualitative picture, a more detailed theoretical analysis is necessary for this relaxation dynamics. In summary, the para -hydroxy compound ( 3E ) shows superior UVB-blocking performance with respect to the relaxation process to ortho -( 1E ) and meta -( 2E ) compounds. It also has the best performance among the derivatives studied here, considering its absorption and photostability. Based on the absorption spectra compared in Fig. S10, † the para -methoxy compound shows a similar or slightly better UVB absorbing performance than the para -hydroxy compound considering that both compounds have similar photostability and photoemission properties. 9,25
 ###### 
From cou.: 59 The relaxation processes in the excited states are important for UV-blocking molecules. One possible relaxation is a nonradiative decay via the conical intersection or the nπ* state.21,22 The emission or radiative decay competes with the nonradiative decay to the ground state. We focus here on the former relaxation pathway via the conical intersection. As discussed above, theoretical radiative lifetime is dependent on the substituent and also its position. This means that the ratio of the radiative to nonradiative decay varies among the compounds. For example, the radiative decay of ortho and meta compounds is slower than that of para compounds in the theoretical results.
From Soup: 59 A series of cinnamates ( 1E–9E ) and cinnamic acids ( 1A–9A ) with monohydroxy-, -nitro- and -fluoro substituents were synthesized to explore better performance in UVB blocking. The absorption and emission spectra of these compounds were observed and the photostability examined.
 ###### 
From cou.: 60 Hydroxy cinnamates show a relatively better UVB blocking performance than nitro and fluoro compounds with regard to absorption and photostability. The emission strength is very different among three hydroxy derivatives. Thus, we concentrate here on the nonradiative relaxation of hydroxy derivatives and examine the relevant cis–trans isomerization at the propenyl double bond. The S1 and S2 PECs along the torsion angle ω(C3–C7C9–C11) were calculated for the hydroxy methyl cinnamates (1E–3E). Many internal coordinates would also contribute to the relaxation process. The PECs were calculated by CIS(D)/6-31G(d)//CIS/6-31G(d) calculations using the partial optimization for torsion angles (ω = 0°−40° and 140°−180°) with all the other coordinates being optimized. The calculated S1 and S2 PECs are shown in Fig. 7. The vertical absorption energy levels of the S1, S2 and T2 states are also shown in the figure except for the T1 state which is located much below (about 3.5 eV). From the oxygen-quenching experiment, the relaxation predominantly occurs via a singlet S1 excited state for hydroxy cinnamates. The energy barrier (ω = 180–140°) to the conical intersection, which we can evaluate properly by the present method, is an important factor in the relaxation process.
From Soup: 60 The characteristics of the absorption spectra in the UVB region were reasonably reproduced in both peak position and intensity by the SAC-CI calculations, and the transition character of these 18 derivatives is analyzed in detail. The hydroxy derivatives have broad absorption bands in the UVA and UVB regions. The emission spectra with oxygen quenching suggest that the emission or relaxation of some derivatives with an electron-withdrawing group (nitro and fluoro derivatives) occurs via a triplet state, whereas those with an electron-donating group (hydroxy derivatives) occur via a singlet excited state. However, this is not the general trend and depends on the substitution position or derivatives. Based on the examination of the photoabsorption after irradiation, the hydroxy derivatives show excellent photostability compared with that of the nitro and fluoro derivatives. We also examined the S 1 and S 2 PECs of the hydroxy derivatives along the torsion angle at the phenylene double bond, which leads to the conical intersection. Derivatives substituted at the meta position have an energy barrier to the conical intersection in S 1 and therefore show a relatively strong fluorescence, whereas those at the para position show weak fluorescence without an energy barrier, leading to nonradiative decay.
