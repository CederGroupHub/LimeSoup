From cou.: 1 A nanocomposite SnO2 electrode was prepared and its activity on electrocatalytic degradation of sulfamethazine was investigated. Compared with the traditionally dip-coated SnO2 electrode and the dip-coated SnO2 on TiO2 nanotube electrode, the nanocomposite SnO2 electrode has better surface configuration, better crystallinity and a higher electrocatalyst loading, and it also shows better electrocatalytic activity on sulfamethazine degradation. The sulfamethazine elimination rate on the nanocomposite SnO2 electrode increases with current density in the range of 10–30 mA cm−2, but decreases when the current density further increases to 50 mA cm−2. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate increases with current density in the range of 10–50 mA cm−2, whereas the increase of current density results in a decrease of current efficiency. The solution pH has a certain effect on sulfamethazine degradation as an increase of pH from 3.0 to 10.0 can lower both the sulfamethazine elimination rate and the COD removal rate. Ozone generation and hydroxyl radical formation are determined in the electrolytic system. The oxygen evolution potential of the nanocomposite SnO2 electrode decreases with the increase of solution pH, which should be responsible for the better performance of this electrode on sulfamethazine degradation in acidic electrolyte.

From cou.: 5 SMT is a known antibiotic, which belongs to the group of heterocyclic sulfonamides and it is widely used as an antibacterial drug in medicine and veterinary practice.23 The chemical structure of SMT is shown in Fig. 1. As the most commonly used sulfonamide, SMT has been frequently detected in both surface waters and ground waters.23–26 The potential effects of SMT residue include a great impact on aquatic ecosystems, development of antibiotic resistant bacteria and danger to human health by food cycle enrichment.27,28 Efforts have been made in recent years to develop cost-effective technologies, including a membrane biofilm reactor,27 photocatalysis,28 use of the photo-Fenton reaction,29 persulfate oxidation,30 UV/H2O2,31 ferrate(VI) oxidation,32 chlorination,33 and so on, for SMT decomposition and detoxification. Yet the electrocatalytic degradation of SMT using an efficient anode has seldom been investigated34 and there is no report on SMT degradation using an SnO2 electrode. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the electrocatalytic degradation of SMT on the prepared nanocomposite SnO2 electrode.

From cou.: 6 The nanocomposite SnO2 electrode was prepared by TiO2 nanotube preparation and following deposition of the inner and outer coating layers, the Ti plate with a dimension of 2 cm × 2 cm was used as the base material. The plate was polished using 360-grit, 400-grit, 800-grit, 1000-grit and 1500-grit sand papers, degreased in hot 40% NaOH at 80 °C for 2 h, and then etched in 10% boiling oxalic acid for 2 h followed by thorough washing with deionized water, and then dried. The TiO2 nanotubes were prepared by anodic oxidation on the pretreated Ti plate. The anodic oxidation experiment was carried out at 25 °C with a cell voltage of 20 V for 2 h using a two-electrode system (2 cm separation) in which platinum foil serves as counter electrode (with the same area as the Ti plate). The electrolyte is a mixture of NaF (0.2 M) and Na2SO4 (0.1 M) in a solution of polyethylene glycol and deionized water with a volume ratio of 90:10. After anodic oxidation, the TiO2 nanotubes (Ti/TiO2-NT) obtained were thoroughly cleaned using deionized water. The Sn–Sb inner layer was prepared by electrodeposition followed by thermal oxidation. The Ti/TiO2-NT were first cathodically electrodeposited in citric acid solution containing 0.2 M SnCl2 at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 85 s and then were electrodeposited in citric acid solution containing 0.1 M SbCl3 at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 6 s. The Sn2+ and Sb3+ ions were deposited on the TiO2-NT with formation of Sn and Sb separately, because of the electrochemical redox processes. Such procedures were repeated 10 times and the electrode was heated in a muffle oven at 400 °C for 1 h. To get the outer layer, the uniformly coated plate was hot annealed after being dip-coated in an alcohol solution consisting of 1.0 M SnCl4·5H2O, 0.016 M SbCl3, and 0.002 M NiCl2·6H2O in n-butanol. After five cycles of dipping and drying (in a forced convection oven), the electrode was heated in a muffle oven (400 °C for 10 min) for pyrolysis of the coating. This whole process (dipping, drying and pyrolysis) was repeated five times and finally, the electrode was heated at 550 °C for 3 h.

All the other chemicals and solvents were of analytical grade. Electrochemical degradation of SMT was conducted in a series of 250 mL glass beakers used as electrolysis cells on a magnetic stirrer for continuous mixing. For each cell, the working anode prepared as described above was sandwiched between two cathodes of Ti plates (2 cm × 2 cm) 2 cm away from the anode. A direct current potentiostat with a voltage range of 0–30 V was used as the power supply. For the electrolysis testing, 250 mL of 100 mg L−1 SMT solution was placed in the cell, with 0.1 M Na2SO4 as the supporting electrolyte. During the investigations on the effect of solution pH on SMT degradation, the concentrated H2SO4 solution and the concentrated NaOH solution were used to adjust the solution pH. The solution in the electrolysis cell was analyzed to determine the concentration of SMT and COD at the end of each run based on a pre-determined electrolysis time.

From Soup: 27 The morphology of the freshly prepared nanocomposite SnO 2 electrode which has not been used for electrolysis was examined by FESEM ( Fig. 2(a)–(c) ). The micrographs of the Ti/SnO 2 electrode and the Ti/TiO 2 (NT)–SnO 2 electrode are also shown as a comparison ( Fig. 2(d) and (e) ). In Fig. 2(a) , the vertically aligned and compact TiO 2 nanotubes with a height of about 1 μm are formed on the Ti plate after anodic oxidation and the open mouth diameter of these nanotubes is about 100 nm. After the electrodeposition step, these tubes are filled by small Sn–Sb particles and there are several layers of Sn–Sb spherical particles extending from the top of the tubes ( Fig. 2(b) ). The amount of the material that completely fills the nanotube and covers the mouth of the tubes is 25.4 g m −2 , as determined by weight gain measurements. This deposited Sn–Sb inner layer reduces the electrochemical resistance caused by the TiO 2 nanotubes and the Sn–Sb particles also serve as seeds, which facilitate the growth of the SnO 2 crystals in the following dip-coating step. Therefore, compared with that of the Ti/SnO 2 electrode ( Fig. 2(d) ) and Ti/TiO 2 (NT)–SnO 2 electrode ( Fig. 2(e) ), the surface of the nanocomposite SnO 2 electrode which is finally obtained is more compact and more uniform ( Fig. 2(c) ).

From Soup: 28 A uniform distribution of elements of Sn, Sb, and Ni on the prepared SnO 2 electrode's surface is found by X-ray dot mapping (results not shown). However, the contents of the dopants (Sb and Ni) in the coating film have deviated from the Sb and Ni contents in the dipping solution, as shown in Table 1 . This deviation is thought to be caused by the different volatilities of the components and the diffusion of these elements in the base material, the inner layer and the outer layer during the drying and pyrolysis processes. 13

From Soup: 29 The XRD pattern of nanocomposite SnO 2 electrode is shown in Fig. 3 , with the main diffraction peaks labelled with their composition. For comparison, the XRD patterns of the Ti/SnO 2 and Ti/TiO 2 (NT)–SnO 2 electrodes are also shown. Besides a series of diffraction peaks corresponding to SnO 2 in all of the samples, there are also peaks for TiO 2 and other titanium oxides ( e.g. , Ti 6 O) in the XRD spectra; whereas no diffraction peaks of Sb or Ni metal oxide are observed because of either the low doping level of these elements or the incorporation of these doping ions into the crystal unit cell of the existing oxides ( e.g. , SnO 2 ). The average crystallite size of SnO 2 ranges from 8 to 10 nm which is calculated from XRD data using the Scherrer equation. The highest intensity of the SnO 2 diffraction peaks is found to correspond to the nanocomposite SnO 2 electrode, suggesting that a well-developed SnO 2 crystal is obtained, and this speculation is proved by the crystallinity calculation.

From Soup: 30 The intensity of TiO 2 and Ti 6 O diffraction peaks for the Ti/TiO 2 (NT)–SnO 2 electrode is found to be stronger than that of other two electrodes, whereas the intensity of SnO 2 diffraction peaks for this electrode is the weakest among the three electrodes. These results should be caused by a thinner SnO 2 coating film on the Ti/TiO 2 (NT)–SnO 2 electrode. Actually, the loading amount of electrocatalyst onto the Ti plate is 36.1 g m −2 for the nanocomposite SnO 2 electrode, 7.6 g m −2 for the Ti/SnO 2 electrode and 7.3 g m −2 for the Ti/TiO 2 (NT)–SnO 2 electrode, as determined by weight gain measurements. The lower loading amount of electrocatalyst for the Ti/TiO 2 (NT)–SnO 2 electrode should be caused by the fact that the dipping solution is difficult to get into the TiO 2 nanotubes. In the contrast, the electrodeposition process can fill the TiO 2 nanotubes with the expected particles and facilitate the growth of the outer layer of the coating film. Therefore, the electrocatalyst loading amount on the nanocomposite SnO 2 electrode is much higher which should favor the electrocatalytic activity.

From Soup: 34 Different current inputs were applied to investigate the performance of the nanocomposite SnO 2 electrode on SMT degradation, as shown in Fig. 5 . The SMT elimination rate increases with increasing current density from 10 mA cm −2 to 30 mA cm −2 , and decreases from 30 mA cm −2 to 50 mA cm −2 ( Fig. 5(a) ). The observed rates of SMT elimination are fitted with first-order rate constants ( Table 2 ), and the rate of elimination at the current density of 30 mA cm −2 is 72% higher than that at 10 mA cm −2 and 32% higher than that at 50 mA cm −2 . As is well-known, the first-order kinetics mean that the reaction is rapid and the whole process is under mass transfer control. So, because of the good first-order behavior shown by the present results, we can expect a higher efficiency for SMT removal by applying some improvements, such as enhancing convection and keeping a higher organic concentration by continuous flow.

From Soup: 35 In Fig. 5(b) , an even greater difference is observed for COD removal in SMT electrolysis. The COD removal rate increases with increasing current density in the range of 10 mA cm −2 to 50 mA cm −2 ( Table 2 ). However, the rate begins to increase after 8.5 h electrolysis at a current density of 30 mA cm −2 or 50 mA cm −2 ( Fig. 5(b) , inserted figure), as the rate increases to about 3 times at 30 mA cm −2 and 5 times at 50 mA cm −2 ( Table 2 ). Therefore, the overall rate of COD removal is not a first-order process over time at 30 mA cm −2 or 50 mA cm −2 . A reasonable explanation is that there is a formation of different intermediate products during SMT electrolysis which are more readily oxidized.

From Soup: 36 During the electrolysis process, pH variations are detected in the SMT solutions ( Fig. 5(c) ). The solution pH drops from 7.0 to about 4.0 (at current densities of 10 mA cm −2 and 30 mA cm −2 ) or to 4.5 (at a current density of 50 mA cm −2 ), and then increases to values nearly equal to the initial pH. The acidic intermediate production in SMT electrolysis and the further decomposition of these intermediates are thought to be the main reason for the pH change in SMT electrolysis. Colour changes are also observed during the electrolysis of the SMT solutions. The clear and colourless liquid turns to light yellow with the decrease of SMT concentration and the yellow colour begins to fade when the SMT concentration reduces to zero whereas the COD has not been completely removed. As well as the pH variation, this colour change also suggests that some intermediates are formed in the electrolysis process. Some researchers have determined the intermediates of SMT in AOP which include mononuclear aromatics ( e.g. , aniline and phenol). 30 Further electrolysis of these mononuclear aromatics and the formation of following intermediates ( e.g. , quinone and aliphatic acids) lead to pH variation and the colour change of the solution. 6,10,11 Nevertheless, more than 90% of COD was found to have been removed in all of the runs ( Fig. 5(b) ) at the end of the experiments, implying an almost complete mineralization of SMT, which agrees with the results of the pH variation experiments.

From Soup: 37 Current efficiency is calculated from eqn (2) and is shown in Fig. 5(d) . Although generally the current efficiency decreases with reaction time, it fluctuates as the reaction time is prolonged. The fluctuation of current efficiency implies that there are different oxidation potentials of the intermediates formed in different stages of SMT degradation, that is, some intermediates are ready to be oxidized and provide higher efficiency, while others are resistant to oxidation and result in a lower current efficiency. The average current efficiency (ACE) significantly decreases with the increase of current density ( Table 2 ), as the ACE value at 10 mA cm −2 is 73% higher than that at 30 mA cm −2 and 162% higher than that at 50 mA cm −2 . The loss of current efficiency should be caused by some side-reactions ( e.g. , oxygen generation) which cause additional charge consumption. 11

From Soup: 38 The energy consumption per unit of COD removal ( E p ) is calculated from eqn (3) based on the experiments. Generally, the variation trend of E p with reaction time is opposite to that of current efficiency (data not shown). The average energy consumption (AEp) is shown in Table 2 and it increases with the increase of current density, as the AEp value at 10 mA cm −2 is less than half of that at 30 mA cm −2 and is about a quarter of that at 50 mA cm −2 . It is easy to understand that increase of current density would raise the cell voltage and cause more energy consumption. Reducing the distance between the anode and the cathode can lower the cell voltage and accordingly saves electric energy. Therefore, the electrolytic cell construction and the electrode arrangement is important, especially in the scale-up treatment processes.

From Soup: 40 As mentioned previously, the solution pH varies during the SMT electrolysis. On the one hand, this pH variation indicates some formation of intermediates and their further degradation in the electrolysis. On the other hand, the change of solution pH may have some special effect on the organics removal in some AOP, because the pH value usually influences the surface properties of the catalyst and the dissociation of organic pollutants in aqueous solution. 37 Therefore, the SMT degradation experiments were carried out at constant pH values of 3.0 and 10.0, and the results are shown in Fig. 6 . For comparison, the SMT degradation results in a solution with an initial pH value of 7.0 and without any adjustment are also shown.

From Soup: 41 From Fig. 6(a) , it is obvious that SMT elimination rate varies with the change of solution pH. The rate at pH 3.0 is 22% higher than that at pH 7.0, whereas the rate at pH 10.0 is 9.1% lower than that at pH 7.0 ( Table 3 ). In Fig. 6(b) , the same trend but an even great difference is observed in COD removal with different solution pH. Although the COD removal rate at pH 3.0 is only 1.8% higher than that at pH 7.0 in the first 12 h of electrolysis, it increases quickly and is 218% higher than that at pH 7.0 in the following stage ( Fig. 6(b) , inserted figure and Table 3 ). As for the COD removal rate at pH 10.0, it is 36% lower than that at pH 7.0.

From Soup: 42 Fig. 6(b) also indicates that the instantaneous COD removal rate at an initial pH of 7.0 without adjustment is fluctuates more than that at a constant pH of 3.0 or 10.0. A reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is that the variation of solution pH during electrolysis (as shown in Fig. 5(c) ) affects the performance of the working electrode on oxidation of SMT and its intermediate products.

From Soup: 43 The effect of solution pH on current efficiency is shown in Fig. 6(c) and the ACE is summarized in Table 3 . The highest ACE is obtained at pH 3.0, which is 48% higher than that obtained at pH 7.0 and 104% higher than that obtained at pH 10.0. The energy consumption is also calculated and the lowest AEp is achieved at pH 3.0 ( Table 3 ). It should be noted that the solution pH does not affect the cell voltage very much. Therefore, the change of solution pH does not change the AEp value as much as that of the current density.

From Soup: 44 As mentioned previously, an almost complete mineralization of SMT is obtained on the nanocomposite SnO 2 electrode in the electrochemical oxidation process. The doped SnO 2 –Sb electrode is known to be one of the most promising electrodes in the electrocatalytic oxidation of organic pollutants because of its powerful productivity on ˙OH. 6,9–11,13,15,18–21 The co-doped SnO 2 –Sb–Ni electrode has also been proved to have good capacity for ozone generation. 17,38 Therefore, the products of water splitting on the nanocomposite SnO 2 electrode should be a complex mixture consisting of oxygen, ozone, ˙OH, and so on. In the present study, the primary reactive species generated, and detected, from the anode, are shown in Fig. 7 . Ozone generation is observed in the electrolyte without SMT addition, and its concentration increases to a steady value after 40 min electrolysis. The fluorescence intensity of the electrolyte is also recorded by using terephthalic acid as a quenching agent, and the ˙OH generation is confirmed. However, in the electrolyte with SMT addition, both the ozone generation and the fluorescence intensity are weakened and are difficult to detect (data not shown). A reasonable explanation is that the electro-generated ozone and ˙OH are consumed in the SMT degradation process.

From Soup: 45 The possible pathways and the mechanisms of SMT degradation in some AOP have been reported in recent studies. 29,34,39 As one of the AOP, electrocatalytic degradation of SMT should be similar to that of other AOP which involve radical processes. In the present study, the observed phenomena, such as colour change and pH variation, during SMT electrolysis under different experimental conditions are not significantly different except for the reaction rate, indicating similar mechanisms and pathways. Thus, the different degradation rates and current efficiencies on SMT electrolysis caused by different current inputs could be explained as follows. The water molecules splitting on the nanocomposite SnO 2 electrode would generate ˙OH, which may directly react with organics or transform to some by-products ( e.g. , oxygen and ozone). In an undivided and open cell, as in the present study, these anodic by-products would transfer to the atmosphere or be deoxidized near the cathode. Some of these by-products can directly react with organics (SMT and its oxidation products) as electro-generated oxidants or through a radical process ( e.g. , ˙OH), while others fail in the organics oxidation and result in a loss of electricity. The more oxidants and radicals generated by increasing current input certainly accelerate the SMT degradation, whereas many more by-products would also be produced which fail in the oxidation of organics because the concentration of the organics is limited. Therefore, the current efficiency decreases with the increase of current input.

From Soup: 46 Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to investigate the effect of solution pH on the performance of the nanocomposite SnO 2 electrode on SMT degradation, as shown in Fig. 8 . According to the CV curves in the absence of SMT ( Fig. 8(a) ), the nanocomposite SnO 2 electrode has the highest oxygen evolution potential at pH 3.0, followed by pH 7.0 and pH 10.0. It is well known that the anode with a high oxygen evolution potential is advantageous to organics oxidation in aqueous solution because the power loss induced by oxygen generation would be decreased. Therefore, the higher oxygen evolution potential should be the main reason for the better performance of nanocomposite SnO 2 electrode on SMT degradation at pH 3.0.

From Soup: 47 Fig. 8(b) shows the CV curves in the presence of SMT. No significant oxidation process could be found prior to the oxygen evolution potential, implying that SMT is indirectly oxidized in the present experiments. However, comparing the CV curves with and without SMT, it is observed that the current increases more rapidly at pH 3.0 or 7.0 than at pH 10.0 after the oxygen evolution potential. This increase of current should be caused by the SMT oxidation because the SMT and its intermediate products are more readily oxidized at lower solution pH, as mentioned previously.

From Soup: 49 An almost complete oxidation of SMT and its intermediate products is obtained on the nanocomposite SnO 2 electrode, which is attributed to some electro-generated powerful oxidants such as ozone and hydroxyl radicals. With the increase of current density, the SMT elimination rate and its COD removal rate vary but do not simply increase. Generally, the increase of current density favors the oxidation of organics, especially for the oxidation of some intermediates produced in the SMT degradation process, whereas the current efficiency decreases with the increase of current because of the generation of many more by-products. The solution pH has a remarkable effect on SMT degradation as both the SMT elimination rate and the COD removal rate at pH 3.0 are notably higher than those at pH 7.0 or 10.0. The higher oxygen evolution potential at a lower solution pH is mainly responsible for the better performance of the nanocomposite SnO 2 electrode on SMT degradation in an acidic electrolyte.
