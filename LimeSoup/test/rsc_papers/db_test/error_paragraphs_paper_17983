From cou.: 1 The three-phase hydrogenation of 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol has been studied over a Pd/ZnO catalyst. A Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism was applied assuming noncompetitive adsorption between hydrogen and organic molecules on the catalyst active sites. All experimental runs used for the modeling have been obtained in the intrinsic kinetic regime in order to exclude any mass transfer limitation. An optimization procedure allowed the estimation of the kinetic and adsorption parameters governing the process. The results revealed that the proposed model accurately describes the behavior of the system in the typical operating ranges of industrial reactors. The performance of the catalyst in terms of selectivity to 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol and initial activity is found to be higher compared with that of a commercial Lindlar catalyst under the same operating conditions. The mathematical model, successfully validated, is able to accurately predict the selectivity of the process.

From cou.: 5 High selectivities to MBE are required due to the difficulties in separation of the mixture MBE/MBA.2 A typical approach to enhance the selectivity of the reaction to MBE is the addition of nitrogen-based modifiers (e.g. quinoline, pyridine, ammonia).5 These electron donor compounds inhibit alkene surface interactions due to their preferential adsorption on the surface of the catalyst.6 However, this incorporation requires further process steps, such as separation, resulting in additional costs.

From cou.: 8 The performance of Pd-based catalysts during alkynes hydrogenations is also strongly influenced by the nature of the support. ZnO in particular is often considered a good alternative to CaCO3 with respect to reaction selectivity.10 High selectivities towards the alkene have been reported for monometallic Pd-based catalysts over ZnO.5,9,11 The electron donating effect of Zn results in an higher electron density of Pd.

From cou.: 60 The total percentage standard deviation for all the performed experiments are listed in Table 3. In all cases these overall deviations are comparable with those related to the single components.
From Soup: 60 The values of the pre-exponential factors k 0i and K 0i previously estimated for the Lindlar catalyst 13 were used as initial data for the optimization procedure. The best-estimated pre-exponential factors do not differ significantly from the initial data with the only exception of k 03 . This discrepancy is related to the much lower concentration of dimers detected in the reaction system with respect to the hydrogenation conducted over the Lindlar catalyst. However, the estimation of this constant is less reliable compared to the others since the associated error is greater than 10%.

From cou.: 61 Fig. 6 and 7 show the comparison of simulated results with the experimental concentrations of MBY and MBE for different temperatures and pressures. The model appears to be consistent with the experimental results in the investigated range of operating conditions.
From Soup: 61 The activation energy of MBY hydrogenation E 1 is found to be in good agreement with the value of 25.2 ± 1.6 kJ mol −1 reported by Crespo-Quesada et al. for a structured Pd/ZnO catalyst. 9

From cou.: 62 Table 4 presents the best-estimated values of the kinetic and adsorption parameters with their 95% confidence intervals, resulting from the optimization procedure.
From Soup: 62 The ratio between the kinetic coefficients of alkene and alkyne hydrogenation k 2 / k 1 results to be higher than 1 in the investigated range of temperatures. According to the thermodynamic of the alkynes the over-hydrogenation reaction is favored from a kinetic point of view. 18 The reason of the high selectivity of the process to MBE is attributed to the stronger adsorption of the alkyne compared to the alkene. However, the adsorption equilibrium constant of MBY is found to be 5.83 × 10 −4 m 3 mol −1 at 333 K, slightly lower than the ones previously published for Lindlar catalyst, resulting in a lower adsorption strength of the alkyne. On the other hand the ratio of the adsorption equilibrium constants of MBY and MBE K Y / K E ranges between 97 and 140 depending on the investigated temperature. This value is 40% higher than the corresponding ones previously calculated for the Lindlar catalyst. 13,19

From Soup: 63 In accordance with published data, the formation of a Pd–Zn alloy can change the adsorption strength of alkynes and alkenes affecting the selectivity of the hydrogenation. 7,20 The addition of Zn, in particular, is considered to be beneficial for the selectivity of the process towards the alkene. 7 It affects the electronic structure of Pd resulting in a decrease of the heat of adsorption of alkynes and alkenes. 8,21 As a result of the observed increase of the ratio K Y / K E , the selectivity of the process to MBE is significantly enhanced. This tendency is depicted in Fig. 8 and 9 where the selectivity of the process to MBE over the Pd/ZnO is compared with the one obtained with the Lindlar catalyst under the same experimental conditions and the same palladium loading. In both cases the Pd/ZnO exhibits an higher selectivity compared with the Lindlar catalyst at various conversions.

From Soup: 64 The continuous lines represent the theoretical selectivity calculated using the best-estimated values of the parameters. It is worthy to note that the model delivers good predictions of the system behavior even at high conversions of MBY. Therefore, it allows estimation of the experimental selectivity of the process with good accuracy.

From cou.: 65 The ratio between the kinetic coefficients of alkene and alkyne hydrogenation k2/k1 results to be higher than 1 in the investigated range of temperatures. According to the thermodynamic of the alkynes the over-hydrogenation reaction is favored from a kinetic point of view.18 The reason of the high selectivity of the process to MBE is attributed to the stronger adsorption of the alkyne compared to the alkene. However, the adsorption equilibrium constant of MBY is found to be 5.83 × 10−4 m3 mol−1 at 333 K, slightly lower than the ones previously published for Lindlar catalyst, resulting in a lower adsorption strength of the alkyne. On the other hand the ratio of the adsorption equilibrium constants of MBY and MBE KY/KE ranges between 97 and 140 depending on the investigated temperature. This value is 40% higher than the corresponding ones previously calculated for the Lindlar catalyst.13,19
From Soup: 65 The reaction carried out at 333 K and 0.7 MPa using the commercial Lindlar catalyst showed a lower initial activity of 0.9 mol mol Pd −1 s −1 compared with the 3.0 mol mol Pd −1 s −1 of the Pd/ZnO catalyst. Similar trends were obtained during previous studies on the hydrogenation of MBY over Lindlar and Pd/ZnO catalysts. 5,9 The higher activity may be ascribed to the presence of the Pd–Zn alloy in the active phase of the catalyst suppressing the overhydrogenation of MBE to MBA.

From Soup: 68 Stability of the catalyst was evaluated performing hydrogenation experiments over 6 consecutive reaction cycles.

From Soup: 70 A Pd/ZnO catalyst has been developed and tested in the hydrogenation of MBY under solvent free conditions. External mass transfer limitations have been studied in order to ensure the kinetic regime of the experimental runs.

From Soup: 71 The proposed kinetic model reliably estimates the concentration profiles of the species involved in the system in the investigated ranges of operating conditions (313–353 K, 0.3–1.0 MPa) and for varying catalyst loadings (0.25–0.75 wt%). The goodness of the optimization is confirmed by the overall standard deviation lower than 7.0% obtained for each experimental run. The model also allows the selectivity of the process to MBE to be estimated with high accuracy.

From Soup: 73 The high selectivity of the process to MBE is found to be related to the thermodynamics of the alkyne hydrogenation. Zn acts as a promoter in a Pd-based catalyst resulting in a lower adsorption strength of alkynes and alkenes. As result, the Pd/ZnO catalyst exhibits higher selectivity and higher initial activity compared to the lead-containing Pd catalysts. For this reason, it can be considered as a valuable alternative for the industrial hydrogenation of MBY with respect to the classic Lindlar catalyst.
