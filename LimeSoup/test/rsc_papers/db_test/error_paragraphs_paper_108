From Soup: 0 A neutral mixed-sandwich zirconacarborane alkyl [η1:σ:η5-{MeN(CH2)CH2CH2}C2B9H10]Zr(η5-Cp′′) (Cp′′ = 1,3-(Me3Si)2C5H3) was prepared via methane elimination reaction of 7-Me2N(H)CH2CH2-7,8-C2B9H11 with (η5-Cp′′)ZrMe3, followed by an intramolecular C–H activation. It reacted with internal alkynes and trimethylsilylacetylene to give the Zr–C σ bond mono-insertion products; however, the terminal alkyne 3,3-dimethyl-1-butyne underwent an acid–base reaction to produce a zirconium alkynyl complex. Both electronic and steric factors affected the regioselectivity of the insertion process. The results showed that the coordination of the sidearm nitrogen atom could enhance the thermal stability of the resulting zirconacarborane alkyl, and on the other hand, lowered the Lewis acidity of the Zr atom, leading to relatively poor reactivity. All complexes were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy and elemental analyses. Most of them were further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analyses.

From Soup: 1 Cationic group 4 metallocene alkyls of the general type (C5R5)2M(R)+ have received great interest as they exhibit rich insertion, olefin polymerization, and C–H bond activation chemistry, which are highly sensitive to the structural and electronic properties of (C5R5)2M fragments. 1 Replacement of a uninegative C5R5− in (C5R5)2M(R)+ by a dinegative isolobal C2B9H112− ligand results in the formation of a class of neutral mixed-sandwich group 4 metallacarborane alkyls (C5Me5)(C2B9H11)M(R) that have similar properties to those of cationic (C5R5)2M(R)+. 2 Unfortunately, these neutral metal alkyls such as (C5Me5)(C2B9H11)Zr(Me) are not stable even at 45 °C, which limits their applications. 2a We attempted to increase their thermal stability by introducing carbon-bridged hybrid ligands [Me2C(C5H4)(C2B9H10)]3−/[Me2C(C9H6)(C2B9H10)]3−/[H2C(C5Me4)(C2B9H10)]3−, leading to the isolation of ansa-metallocene dialkyl anionic complexes rather than the neutral metallocene alkyls. 3 This can be ascribed to the much increased “bite angles” 3,4 of the resulting ansa-metallocenes compared with the corresponding unbridged ones, 2 which results in a more open coordination sphere around the metal center, thus facilitating the binding of additional anionic ligands. It seems that ansa-ligands are not a good solution to solve the thermal stability problem of (C5Me5)(C2B9H11)M(R). We thought an alternative way to address this issue is to introduce a functional sidearm to the dicarbollyl ligand in the hope that coordination of the sidearm to the central metal could stabilize the resulting metal alkyls while keeping the metal geometry unchanged. 5 Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization and reactivity of a mixed-sandwich zirconacarborane alkyl [η1:σ:η5-{MeN(CH2)CH2CH2}C2B9H10]Zr(η5-Cp′′) (Cp′′ = 1,3-(Me3Si)2C5H3).

From Soup: 2 Alkane elimination is often used for the clean formation of zirconacarborane alkyl complexes. 6 Treatment of (η5-Cp′′)ZrMe3 with 1 equiv. of the zwitterionic salt 7-Me2N(H)CH2CH2-7,8-C2B9H11 5g,7 in toluene at temperatures between −30 °C and 28 °C overnight afforded a mixed-sandwich zirconacarborane alkyl [η1:σ:η5-{MeN(CH2)CH2CH2}C2B9H10]Zr(η5-Cp′′) (1) in 80% isolated yield ( Scheme 1 ). The expected zirconacarborane methyl complex (η5-Cp′′)[η1:η5-(Me2NCH2CH2)C2B9H10]Zr(Me) was not obtained probably due to its thermal instability. However, it should serve as an intermediate for alkane elimination reaction and subsequently eliminates one CH4 molecule via the rupture of a C–H bond at one of the N-methyl groups to give the final product 1, as the Zr-methyl is more basic than the N-methyl. 5g Such an intramolecular C–H activation is normally observed in methylzirconocenes 8 and group 4 metallacarborane alkyls. 9

From Soup: 3 Complex 1 was fully characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and elemental analyses. The 1H NMR spectrum showed one broad singlet at 3.15 ppm attributable to the cage CH, two doublets at 2.21 and 2.19 ppm with J = 6.0 Hz assignable to the Zr–CH2 unit in addition to the resonances corresponding to the protons of Cp′′ and sidearm. Its 11B NMR spectrum exhibited a 1 : 1 : 2 : 1 : 2 : 1 : 1 pattern.

From Soup: 4 The migratory insertion reaction is a key step in transition metal catalyzed olefin polymerization. 10 It has been documented that [Cp*(C2B9H11)ZrCH3]n can catalyze ethylene polymerization in the absence of any co-catalyst. 2a,b However, zirconacarborane alkyl 1 showed no reactivity toward alkenes, such as ethylene, 1-hexene and styrene, even under the harsh conditions due probably to the intramolecular coordination of the N atom, leading to decreased Lewis acidity of the Zr center. On the other hand, alkynes can insert into the Zr–C σ bond in 1 to form mono-insertion products. Treatment of symmetrical internal alkynes with 1 in a 1 : 1 molar ratio in toluene afforded [η1:σ:η5-{MeN[CH2(R)C C(R)]CH2CH2}C2B9H10]Zr(η5-Cp′′) [R = Et (2a), nPr (2b), Ph (2c)] in ∼70% isolated yields ( Scheme 2 ). Only mono-insertion products were formed even in the presence of an excess amount of alkynes in refluxing toluene. It was noted that the steric factors played an important role in the reactions. Sterically less demanding linear dialkylalkynes worked at room temperature; however, heating at 70 °C was required for the insertion of diphenylacetylene. No reaction proceeded for sterically demanding TMSC CTMS.

From Soup: 5 When unsymmetrical alkynes were used, regioselectivity would be an issue. The reaction of 1 with 1 equiv. of unsymmetrical internal alkynes (PhC CMe, PhC CTMS and nBuC CTMS) in toluene at 70 °C afforded the mono-insertion products [η1:σ:η5-{MeN[CH2(R1)C C(R2)]CH2CH2}C2B9H10]Zr(η5-Cp′′) [R1 = Ph, R2 = Me (2d); R1 = Ph, R2 = TMS (2e); R1 = nBu, R2 = TMS (2f)] in ∼80% isolated yields ( Scheme 2 ). The regioselectivity observed in 2d may result from the more steric hindrance of Ph over the Me group since phenyl is often considered as an electron-withdrawing group. 11 Complexes 2e and 2f show a totally different regioselectivity from that of 2d, in which the more bulky TMS group is closer to the Zr center. This result could be rationalized on the basis of electronic effects 12 originating from the electron withdrawing SiMe3 group which can override the normal steric preference for 1,2-insertion of alkynes into the Zr–C bonds. These results suggest that both electronic and steric factors affect the regioselectivity of the insertion reaction, depending on the nature of substituents of alkynes.

From Soup: 6 Complexes 2a–f were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and elemental analyses. The unique features of their NMR spectra are two doublets at 3.1–4.6 and 2.1–3.2 ppm attributable to the methylene protons of NCH2C(sp2) in the 1H NMR spectra and two characteristic resonances at 191–202 and 138–153 ppm corresponding to the two vinyl carbons of the Zr(Cα Cβ) unit in the 13C NMR spectra. The latter are very much comparable to the 13C chemical shifts of ∼194 and ∼142 ppm observed in Cp2Zr[C(R) C(R)]2. 13

From Soup: 7 As the sp-CH protons in terminal alkynes are acidic, they may undergo either acid–base or insertion reaction with 1. Treatment of 1 with 1 equiv. of phenylacetylene, 1-hexyne or trimethylsilylacetylene in toluene at room temperature afforded mono-insertion zirconacyclic products [η1:σ:η5-{MeN[CH2(R1)C C(H)]CH2CH2}C2B9H10]Zr(η5-Cp′′) [R1 = nBu (3a); Ph (3b)] or [η1:σ:η5-{MeN[CH2(H)C C(TMS)]CH2CH2}C2B9H10]Zr(η5-Cp′′) (3c), respectively, in ∼80% isolated yields ( Scheme 3 ). The results show that the regioselectivity observed in the above reactions is the same as that found in internal alkynes. In view of the different electronic properties of Ph and n-butyl groups, the regioselectivity in 3a and 3b is dominated by steric and electronic factors, respectively. On the other hand, the bulky TMS is closer to the Zr center in 3c, suggesting that it is an electronically-controlled 1,2-insertion. Unexpectedly, the reaction of 1 with 1 equiv. of 3,3-dimethyl-1-butyne (tBuC CH) in toluene at room temperature produced a zirconium alkynyl complex (η5-Cp′′)[η1:η5-(Me2NCH2CH2)C2B9H10]Zr(C CtBu) (4) in 75% isolated yield ( Scheme 3 ). Only acid–base reaction product 4 was isolated, and no insertion product was observed. The reasons are not clear at this stage. Theoretically, both protonation and insertion reaction could proceed with terminal alkynes, in which both electronic and steric factors play a role. It was noted that terminal alkynes 4-NO2-C6H4C CH, 2-NO2-C6H4C CH and 4-CF3-C6H4C CH were also examined. These reactions were complicated as indicated by NMR spectra, from which no pure products were isolated.

The average Zr–C5 ring distance of 2.509(5) Å is comparable to that of 2.517(5)/2.522(5) Å in (η5-Cp′′)2ZrMe(μ-Me)B(C6F5)3,14 2.523(3) Å in (η5-Cp′′)(C4H4BC6F5)Zr(C6F5)(CNtBu),15 and 2.530(5) Å in (η5-Cp′′)(η5-C13H9)ZrCl2.16 The average Zr–cage atom distance of 2.522(5) Å is comparable to that of 2.540(8) Å in [η5:η5-H2C(C5Me4)(C2B9H10)]Zr[σ:σ-CH2(NMe2)-o-C6H4],3c 2.499 Å in (Cp*)(C2B9H11)Zr[C(Me)CMe2],17 2.535/2.533 Å in [(Cp*)(C2B9H11)Zr]2(μ-CH2),17 and 2.544(6) Å in [η1:σ:η5-{MeN(CH2)CH2CH2}C2B9H10]Zr(CH2SiMe3)(THF).5g The Zr–C σ bond distance of 2.270(4) Å is close to that of 2.282(2) Å in (η5-Cp′′)(η5-C5Me5)ZrH(Me),18 and 2.250(12) Å [Zr–C(sp3)] in Cp2Zr[(Ph)CC(Ph)CH(C6H4)CH],19 but is longer than that of 2.233(6)/2.242(6) Å (Zr–C(N)/Zr–C(TMS)) in [η1:σ:η5-{MeN(CH2)CH2CH2}C2B9H10]Zr(CH2SiMe3)(THF),5g 2.198(4) Å in (Cp*)(C2B9H11)Zr[C(Me)CMe2],17 and 2.187(6)/2.176(7) Å in [(Cp*)(C2B9H11)Zr]2(μ-CH2).17 The Cent(C5)–Zr–Cent(C2B3) angle of 140.0° is comparable to that of 141.3° in (Cp*)(C2B9H11)Zr[C(Me)CMe2],17 is larger than that of 134.9° in [(Cp*)(C2B9H11)Zr]2(μ-CH2),17 but is significantly larger than those observed in the corresponding ansa-metallocenes, such as [η5:η5-Me2C(C5Me4)(C2B9H10)]Zr(NHC6H3Pri2)(THF) (119.2°),3a [η5:η5-Me2C(C9H6)(C2B9H10)]Zr(NMe2)(NHMe2) (115.9°)3b and [η5:η5-Me2C(C5Me4)(C2B9H10)]Zr[σ:σ-CH2(NMe2)-o-C6H4] (120.2°).3c
From Soup: 10 In the molecular structures of 2a, c–f and 3b, c, the Zr atom is η5-bound to both the Cp′′ ring and dicarbollyl ligand, σ-bound to the sp2-C atom of the vinyl unit and coordinated to the N atom in a distorted-tetrahedral geometry. Their representative structures are shown in Fig. 2–6 , respectively. The average Zr–C(C5 ring) and Zr–cage atom distances in these complexes are close to each other and comparable to those in 1. Their Cent(C5 ring)–Zr–Cent(C2B3) angles fall in the range 135.3°–138.6°, which is slightly smaller than that of 140.0° in 1. The Zr–C(sp2) σ bond distances (2.28–2.35 Å) are comparable to that of 2.298(10) Å in Cp2Zr[(Ph)C C(Ph)CH(C6H4)CH] 19 and 2.27–2.31 Å observed in Cp2Zr[C(R) C(R)–C2B10H10], 20 but longer than that of 2.198(4) Å in (Cp*)(C2B9H11)Zr[C(Me) CMe2]. 17 The above X-ray structures unambiguously confirm the regioselective insertion products of alkynes into the Zr–C σ bond in 1.

From Soup: 11 In the solid-state structure of 4, the Zr atom is η5-bound to both the Cp′′ ring and dicarbollyl ligand, σ-bound to the sp-C atom and coordinated to the sidearm nitrogen atom in a distorted tetrahedral geometry. The average Zr–C(C5 ring)/Zr–cage atom distances and the Cent(C5 ring)–Zr–Cent(C2B3) angle of 2.539(4) Å/2.560(5) Å/136.8° are similar to those of 2.537(7) Å/2.550(7) Å/138.6° in 3b.

From Soup: 12 Treatment of Cp′′ZrMe3 with 7-Me2N(H)CH2CH2-7,8-C2B9H11 afforded a neutral mixed-sandwich zirconacarborane alkyl complex (η5-Cp′′)[η1:σ:η5-{MeN(CH2)CH2CH2}C2B9H10]Zr (1) via methane elimination reaction followed by intramolecular C–H activation. It reacted with internal alkynes RC CR′ and terminal alkynes, such as PhC CH, nBuC CH and TMSC CH, to give the Zr–C σ bond mono-insertion products. The results showed that both electronic and steric factors played a role in controlling the regioselectivity of the insertion process. On the other hand, in sharp contrast to [(C5Me5)(C2B9H11)]ZrCH3 that can catalyze ethylene polymerization in the absence of any co-catalyst, 2a,b 1 does not react with alkenes although both complexes have a comparable geometry. Such differences may be ascribed to the relatively low Lewis acidity of the Zr atom in 1 because of the nitrogen coordination. It is reasonable to suggest that a soft heteroatom should be used to replace the N atom, thus enhancing Lewis acidity of the metal center. This work should shed some light on the design of new ligands for active yet thermally stable metallacarborane alkyls.
