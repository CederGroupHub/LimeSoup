From cou.: 1 Vibrational spectra and vibrational predissociation dynamics of the ArHF complex in the lowest van der Waals levels corresponding to the vibrational states of the HF fragment v=0–7 are investigated using an accurate quantum mechanical method and recent three-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PES). The results demonstrate the accuracy of the semiempirical diatomics-in-molecule and empirically corrected ab initio PES's and allow for better understanding of the sensitivity of the vibrational predissociation lifetimes and product state distributions to the interaction potential. Main features of the fragmentation dynamics such as near-resonant vibration-to-rotation energy transfer, strong variation of the predissociation lifetimes with excitation of the van der Waals vibrational modes, and rapid increase of the decay rates with vibrational excitation of HF are analyzed.

From cou.: 2 The ArHF molecule is one of the best studied weakly bound systems. Numerous microwave and infrared spectroscopic studies of the triatomic complex and Arn–HF clusters, as well as the molecular beam measurements of cross sections for elastic and rotationally inelastic scattering, have provided detailed information on the vibrationally-elastic Ar–HF interaction. The two-dimensional semiempirical potential energy surface (PES), H6(4,3,2), constructed from these data by Hutson,1,2 agrees well with the state-of-the-art ab initio calculations3–5 and it is one of the most accurate intermolecular potentials to date.

From cou.: 3 Understanding vibrational energy transfer (VET) in Ar–HF is more difficult although its interesting near-resonant nature was recognized long ago (see, e.g., refs. 6–11) and many experimental measurements of vibrational relaxation (VR) of HF were performed using shock-tube techniques (see, e.g., refs. 12–14). The experimental measurements were limited by the low efficiency of VET at room temperature and the theoretical calculations were hampered by the lack of reliable three-dimensional (3D) PES's and the diversity of dynamical couplings between translational, rotational, and vibrational degrees of freedom that can be accounted for only by advanced methods of quantum scattering theory.

From cou.: 4 Recent spectroscopic studies of the complex probed the vibrational predissociation (VP) process—the fragmentation of the weakly-bound system induced by VET from vibrationally-excited levels of the diatomic fragment. VP is very slow and the early experimental studies of ArHF at low vibrational excitation (v=1,2) provided only the lower limits of the VP lifetimes.15–19 It was later found that the VP rate increases with v and Klemperer and co-workers measured the absolute value of the lifetime and the rotational state distributions of the VP products for the initial state v=3.20 At the same time, reliable 3D PES's have been developed. First, an analytical potential was constructed and fitted to reproduce the spectroscopic data.21 The calculations were based on the first order diatomics-in-molecules (DIM) perturbation theory22 and the model developed by Grigorenko et al.23 Second, a set of semiempirical PES's was obtained from large-scale ab initio calculations and empirical refinement of the resulting potential by Shroll, Lohr, and Barker (SLB).24 Using various morphing procedures, these authors proposed three different potentials, denoted hereafter as SLB V1, V2, and V3.

From cou.: 5 All 3D potentials have been already used for studies of collisional VET. Krems et al.25–28 investigated VR of HF in collisions with Ar using the DIM PES and an accurate scattering method. These works reported the first quantitative theoretical data on the VR efficiency in Ar+HF collisions and illustrated the mechanism of VET. It was shown that the near-resonant character of VR is determined by a large and sharp anisotropy of vibrational couplings and the intensity of the VET is significantly enhanced by both vibrational and rotational excitation of HF. Increasing initial rotational energy also enhances resonant energy transfer to a great extent. The SLB PES's have been implemented for studying VR in similar scattering calculations.24 Rate constants for VR computed with three SLB potentials and the DIM PES are in good agreement at temperatures below 1000 K.28

From cou.: 6 Vibrational predissociation dynamics of the ArHF complex has been studied only with the DIM potential.21,29 It has been demonstrated that VP is also a near-resonant process in which excess vibrational energy is converted almost entirely to the rotational energy of the products resulting in a predominant population of the highest accessible rotational state.21 The quantitative conclusions of this earlier work were, however, affected by inaccuracy in the treatment of high-order rovibrational interaction in the HF molecule within the standard formulation of the close-coupling method.

From Soup: 45 Using eqn. (3) , the Schrödinger equation with the total Hamiltonian is transformed into a system of close coupled equations to be solved for the radial function Φ ( R ). The contribution of multiple-quantum vibrational transitions is negligible 21 so only the functions of v ′ = v − 1 are retained in the expansion (3) . The product state distributions are computed from the partial widths for all final rotational states.
 ###### 
From cou.: 46 21
From Soup: 46 The vibrational functions of HF ( χ v ) in the expansion in eqn. (2) are taken to be independent of the rotational quantum number j . This implies that asymptotic energies of the HF( v , j ) molecule should be those of a rigid rotor, which is a bad approximation for the highly-excited rotational levels of HF involved in the VP dynamics. 21 An ad hoc correction to the asymptotic energies is therefore introduced using high-order terms of the Dunham expansion for rovibrational energy levels taken from refs. 32 and 33 for HF and DF, respectively. The vibrational energies and the rotational constants are evaluated using RKR potentials constructed from low-order terms of the same Dunham expansions and such correction provides accurate rovibrational energies.

From cou.: 49 The vibrational functions of HF (χv) in the expansion in eqn. (2) are taken to be independent of the rotational quantum number j. This implies that asymptotic energies of the HF(v,j) molecule should be those of a rigid rotor, which is a bad approximation for the highly-excited rotational levels of HF involved in the VP dynamics.21 An ad hoc correction to the asymptotic energies is therefore introduced using high-order terms of the Dunham expansion for rovibrational energy levels taken from refs. 32 and 33 for HF and DF, respectively. The vibrational energies and the rotational constants are evaluated using RKR potentials constructed from low-order terms of the same Dunham expansions and such correction provides accurate rovibrational energies.
From Soup: 49 Analytical derivation of the DIM PES can be found in refs. 21 and 23 . The model gives two diabatic potentials for the HF fragment in the neutral and ionic configurations that are coupled by a mixing angle β ( r ) related to the diabatic interaction between these states. The angle is represented by β ( r ) = ar + b with the parameters a and b determined from spectroscopic data on the complex (the dissociation energy for the ground (0000) level and the red shift of the (1000) level). 21 This potential has been used for studying collisional vibrational relaxation of HF. 25,27,28
 ###### 
From cou.: 50 The high accuracy of the DGR approximation for the VP dynamics of the ArHF complex was verified previously by comparison with exact lineshape calculations.21
From Soup: 50 An error has been found in the computer code generating the DIM potential. It affected one of the diatomic potentials contributing to the total PES. Although the subsequent fitting to spectroscopic data diminished the effect of the error, we have constructed a new (correct) DIM PES (with a = 15.61° and b = 8.68 ° Å −1 ). This PES has almost the same topology as the previous DIM potential and leads to somewhat lower rate constants for VR of HF( v = 1) by Ar. 28
 ###### 
From cou.: 51 The PES's used here are described in the original works so only few comments important for the present study follow.
From Soup: 51 The set of the SLB potentials includes the original ab initio PES calculated using second order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory V MP2 and three potentials obtained by means of different refinement procedures. 24 They augment V MP2 with dispersion interaction terms. Two potentials, V 1 and V 2 , were morphed to reproduce accurate ab initio data by van Mourik and Dunning 5 and the H6(4,3,2) potential by Hutson, 1 respectively, and the V 3 PES was obtained by scaling the calculated points to the interaction energy and equilibrium distance known from experimental measurements. Full details can be found in ref. 24 . By construction, the V 2 and V 3 potentials should have similar accuracy while the V 1 PES may be less accurate.
 ###### 
From cou.: 52 Analytical derivation of the DIM PES can be found in refs. 21 and 23. The model gives two diabatic potentials for the HF fragment in the neutral and ionic configurations that are coupled by a mixing angle β(r) related to the diabatic interaction between these states. The angle is represented by β(r)=ar+b with the parameters a and b determined from spectroscopic data on the complex (the dissociation energy for the ground (0000) level and the red shift of the (1000) level).21 This potential has been used for studying collisional vibrational relaxation of HF.25,27,28
From Soup: 52 A Legendre expansion with 35 terms is used to represent the DIM PES. The SLB potentials are represented by a 10-term Legendre series. 24
 ###### 
From cou.: 53 An error has been found in the computer code generating the DIM potential. It affected one of the diatomic potentials contributing to the total PES. Although the subsequent fitting to spectroscopic data diminished the effect of the error, we have constructed a new (correct) DIM PES (with a=15.61° and b=8.68 ° Å−1). This PES has almost the same topology as the previous DIM potential and leads to somewhat lower rate constants for VR of HF(v=1) by Ar.28
From Soup: 53 Cartesian contour plots ( X = R cos θ , Y = R sin θ ) of the DIM and SLB V 2 potentials at the equilibrium distance r e of HF are presented in Fig. 1 . The two-dimensional PES's are similar near the equilibrium distance of HF and have a global minimum at θ = 0° (linear Ar–HF arrangement), a local minimum at θ = 180° (linear Ar–FH arrangement) and a saddle point slightly displaced from the perpendicular θ = 90° configuration towards larger values of the angle.
 ###### 
From cou.: 54 The set of the SLB potentials includes the original ab initio PES calculated using second order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory VMP2 and three potentials obtained by means of different refinement procedures.24 They augment VMP2 with dispersion interaction terms. Two potentials, V1 and V2, were morphed to reproduce accurate ab initio data by van Mourik and Dunning5 and the H6(4,3,2) potential by Hutson,1 respectively, and the V3 PES was obtained by scaling the calculated points to the interaction energy and equilibrium distance known from experimental measurements. Full details can be found in ref. 24. By construction, the V2 and V3 potentials should have similar accuracy while the V1 PES may be less accurate.
From Soup: 54 The experimental measurements of spectroscopic constants of the ArHF and ArDF complexes provide the reference data to test the accuracy of the interaction potentials. We use here the experimental data selected by Hutson for construction of his H6(4,3,2) PES for v = 0–2. 1 There are no experimental measurements for some levels of the ArDF complex and the reference values for these levels are therefore taken as computed with the H6(4,3,2) PES. 1
 ###### 
From cou.: 55 A Legendre expansion with 35 terms is used to represent the DIM PES. The SLB potentials are represented by a 10-term Legendre series.24
From Soup: 55 The calculations on vibrational energy levels are performed for three rotational symmetry blocks J p : 0 + , 1 − , and 1 + . The spectroscopic constants for v = 0 and v = 1 are presented in Table 1 . All potentials reproduce correctly the order of the van der Waals levels, the red shift ( i.e. , the increase of the interaction energy of the complex with vibrational excitation of the HF fragment), and the increase of the vdW vibrational frequencies with v . All PES's, except V MP2 , provide reasonably good estimation of vibrational energies and rotational constants. The stretching frequency Δ E vdW ( v 001) and the corresponding anharmonicity given by the difference between Δ E vdW ( v 002) and Δ E vdW ( v 001) are overestimated by 1–2 cm −1 . The bending frequency Δ E vdW ( v 100) is underestimated by 2–3 cm −1 . The largest deviation is observed for the Π-bending ( v 110) level. Both DIM and MP2 PES's underestimate the energy of this level significantly. Although the calculations with the morphed SLB potentials are closer to the reference data, only the value computed with the V 3 PES is in acceptable agreement with the experimental energy of this level. The red shift of the (1000) level is reproduced in the calculations to within 1.5 cm −1 (the DIM PES gives almost the exact value, but it has been directly fixed by fitting). An increase of the vdW frequencies in the v = 1 manifold is also in agreement with experimental data . Except for the increasing overestimation of the red shift, the agreement between the calculated and measured spectroscopic constants remains similar for all vibrational levels up to v = 4, the highest vibrational state of the complex investigated experimentally. 34
 ###### 
From cou.: 56 Cartesian contour plots (X=Rcosθ,Y=Rsinθ) of the DIM and SLB V2 potentials at the equilibrium distance re of HF are presented in Fig. 1. The two-dimensional PES's are similar near the equilibrium distance of HF and have a global minimum at θ=0° (linear Ar–HF arrangement), a local minimum at θ=180° (linear Ar–FH arrangement) and a saddle point slightly displaced from the perpendicular θ=90° configuration towards larger values of the angle.
From Soup: 56 Although the overall performance of the SLB V 2 PES is better, all three SLB potentials reproduce the spectroscopic constants with similar accuracy despite quite different techniques of morphing. This indicates that the main topological and energetic features of the PES are captured already at the MP2 level of the ab initio theory and simple scaling procedures, like that used to obtain the V 3 PES, 24 can improve the PES significantly (see also ref. 35 which describes the morphing of ab initio potentials for a similar NeHF complex).
 ###### 
From cou.: 57 The experimental measurements of spectroscopic constants of the ArHF and ArDF complexes provide the reference data to test the accuracy of the interaction potentials. We use here the experimental data selected by Hutson for construction of his H6(4,3,2) PES for v=0–2.1 There are no experimental measurements for some levels of the ArDF complex and the reference values for these levels are therefore taken as computed with the H6(4,3,2) PES.1
From Soup: 57 Table 2 compares the spectroscopic constants of ArDF computed with the DIM PES with experimental values. No further refinement of the PES is made, so the agreement is much worse than it is for ArHF. The dissociation energy, the vdW vibrational frequencies and the red shift are noticeably underestimated.
 ###### 
From cou.: 58 The calculations on vibrational energy levels are performed for three rotational symmetry blocks Jp: 0+, 1−, and 1+. The spectroscopic constants for v=0 and v=1 are presented in Table 1. All potentials reproduce correctly the order of the van der Waals levels, the red shift (i.e., the increase of the interaction energy of the complex with vibrational excitation of the HF fragment), and the increase of the vdW vibrational frequencies with v. All PES's, except VMP2, provide reasonably good estimation of vibrational energies and rotational constants. The stretching frequency ΔEvdW(v001) and the corresponding anharmonicity given by the difference between ΔEvdW(v002) and ΔEvdW(v001) are overestimated by 1–2 cm−1. The bending frequency ΔEvdW(v100) is underestimated by 2–3 cm−1. The largest deviation is observed for the Π-bending (v110) level. Both DIM and MP2 PES's underestimate the energy of this level significantly. Although the calculations with the morphed SLB potentials are closer to the reference data, only the value computed with the V3 PES is in acceptable agreement with the experimental energy of this level. The red shift of the (1000) level is reproduced in the calculations to within 1.5 cm−1 (the DIM PES gives almost the exact value, but it has been directly fixed by fitting). An increase of the vdW frequencies in the v=1 manifold is also in agreement with experimental data. Except for the increasing overestimation of the red shift, the agreement between the calculated and measured spectroscopic constants remains similar for all vibrational levels up to v=4, the highest vibrational state of the complex investigated experimentally.34
From Soup: 58 Table 3 presents lifetimes of the lowest vdW levels corresponding to the vibrational states of HF v = 1–3. The use of the SLB potentials for the calculations leads to large errors in the lifetimes for v 2, presumably because these potentials are ill-behaved at short interfragment separations and large values of r . The theoretical results obtained with the SLB potentials are therefore presented only for v = 1.
 ###### 
From cou.: 59 Although the overall performance of the SLB V2 PES is better, all three SLB potentials reproduce the spectroscopic constants with similar accuracy despite quite different techniques of morphing. This indicates that the main topological and energetic features of the PES are captured already at the MP2 level of the ab initio theory and simple scaling procedures, like that used to obtain the V3 PES,24 can improve the PES significantly (see also ref. 35 which describes the morphing of ab initio potentials for a similar NeHF complex).
From Soup: 59 The VP of ArHF( v = 1) is extremely slow. The lifetime of the (1000) level computed with the DIM, V 1 and V 2 potentials is in the range 2.5–3.0 ms (the same result was obtained in the calculations with uncorrected DIM PES in ref. [29] ). These results are in agreement with recent measurements of Nauta and Miller 36 who have estimated the lower limit for the relaxation of ArHF( v = 1) in the helium droplets to be 2.5 ms. The calculations with the V 3 potential underestimate the other results by a factor of two.
 ###### 
From cou.: 60 Table 2 compares the spectroscopic constants of ArDF computed with the DIM PES with experimental values. No further refinement of the PES is made, so the agreement is much worse than it is for ArHF. The dissociation energy, the vdW vibrational frequencies and the red shift are noticeably underestimated.
From Soup: 60 VP lifetimes vary rapidly with excitation of the vdW modes. Excitation of the stretching vibration decreases the VP lifetime by 3–4 times. The calculations with different potentials give the opposite results for the dependence of the VP lifetimes on energy in the bending mode. The data obtained with the SLB potentials show that the vibrational predissociation becomes slower with excitation of both the Σ- and Π-bending modes. The calculations with the DIM potential give comparable lifetimes of the ( v 000) and ( v 100) levels and a much smaller lifetime of the Π-bending ( v 110) level. Experimental data for the (3110) level and estimations for the (2100) and (2110) levels support the results of the calculations with the SLB PES's.
 ###### 
From cou.: 61 Table 3 presents lifetimes of the lowest vdW levels corresponding to the vibrational states of HF v=1–3. The use of the SLB potentials for the calculations leads to large errors in the lifetimes for v2, presumably because these potentials are ill-behaved at short interfragment separations and large values of r. The theoretical results obtained with the SLB potentials are therefore presented only for v=1.
From Soup: 61 It was noted previously that the wave functions of the ground and excited vdW levels have different localization patterns. 18,37 The wave function of the ground level is mainly localized in the global potential minimum of the PES (see Fig. 1 ), the wave function of the Σ-bending excited level is delocalized between the ground and secondary minima and the wave function of the Π-bending excited level is mostly localized in nonlinear geometries. This is illustrated by Cartesian contour plots of the wave functions of the lowest vdW levels of ArHF( v = 0) computed with the DIM and SLB V 2 potentials and shown in Fig. 2 . The localization of the wave functions is similar for these two potentials. The different variations of the VP lifetimes with vdW bending excitations for the different PES's should therefore be determined mainly by the difference in topology between the corresponding interaction potential matrix elements which couple the vibrational states of HF. Fig. 3 depicts Cartesian contour plots of the squared matrix elements 〈 χ v =1 ( r )| V ( r , R , θ )| χ v =0 ( r )〉 r computed with the DIM and SLB V 2 potentials. The vibrational couplings are similar in the vicinity of the global minimum at θ = 0° for both potentials. That is why the lifetimes of the (1000) levels computed with the different potentials are similar ( Table 3 ). The dependence of the vibrational couplings on R is quite different in the vicinity of the secondary minimum at θ = 180°. The matrix element computed with the SLB potential decreases slowly with R and it has a significant magnitude at R as large as 4 Å. The coupling computed with the DIM potential vanishes rapidly as R becomes greater than 3 Å. This rapid variation stimulates the coupling between the bound and continuum vdW wave functions at small R distances and decreases the lifetime of the Σ-bending level. The slower variation of the SLB coupling may induce the VP less effectively. The largest difference between the two couplings is observed at θ close to 90° that is, in the region where the wave function of the Π-bending level is localized (see Fig. 2 ). The DIM coupling varies monotonically and the SLB coupling has a saddle point (minimum in the θ angle and maximum in the R coordinate). This reduces the magnitude of the coupling and makes the VP of the Π-bending level inefficient.
 ###### 
From cou.: 62 The VP of ArHF(v=1) is extremely slow. The lifetime of the (1000) level computed with the DIM, V1 and V2 potentials is in the range 2.5–3.0 ms (the same result was obtained in the calculations with uncorrected DIM PES in ref. [29]). These results are in agreement with recent measurements of Nauta and Miller36 who have estimated the lower limit for the relaxation of ArHF(v=1) in the helium droplets to be 2.5 ms. The calculations with the V3 potential underestimate the other results by a factor of two.
From Soup: 62 The VP lifetimes are practically the same for J = 0 and 1 for all levels except (2100) if calculated with the DIM potential. The lifetimes of this level in the 0 + and 1 − symmetry blocks differ by more than a factor of three ( Table 3 ). The rate of increase of the frequencies of the Σ- and Π-bending levels with v is different ( Table 1 ). For v = 2, these two levels become almost degenerate in the 1 − symmetry block. This leads to a sudden change of the lifetime of the Σ-bending level. The lifetime of the Π-bending level is much less affected although the splitting of the 1 − and 1 + components changes sign with vibrational excitation. This phenomenon can be viewed as an interesting example of the local perturbations in the spectrum of metastable levels.
 ###### 
From cou.: 63 VP lifetimes vary rapidly with excitation of the vdW modes. Excitation of the stretching vibration decreases the VP lifetime by 3–4 times. The calculations with different potentials give the opposite results for the dependence of the VP lifetimes on energy in the bending mode. The data obtained with the SLB potentials show that the vibrational predissociation becomes slower with excitation of both the Σ- and Π-bending modes. The calculations with the DIM potential give comparable lifetimes of the (v000) and (v100) levels and a much smaller lifetime of the Π-bending (v110) level. Experimental data for the (3110) level and estimations for the (2100) and (2110) levels support the results of the calculations with the SLB PES's.
From Soup: 63 The calculations of VP lifetimes for ArDF reveal a small isotope effect which is in agreement with results of experimental and theoretical studies of collisional VET 12,13,25 and the experimental observation of the lifetimes by Oudejans et al. 19 The calculations with the DIM PES give the reverse lifetime ratio for the (1100) and (1110) bending levels in the ArHF as compared to the ArDF complex.
 ###### 
From cou.: 64 It was noted previously that the wave functions of the ground and excited vdW levels have different localization patterns.18,37 The wave function of the ground level is mainly localized in the global potential minimum of the PES (see Fig. 1), the wave function of the Σ-bending excited level is delocalized between the ground and secondary minima and the wave function of the Π-bending excited level is mostly localized in nonlinear geometries. This is illustrated by Cartesian contour plots of the wave functions of the lowest vdW levels of ArHF(v=0) computed with the DIM and SLB V2 potentials and shown in Fig. 2. The localization of the wave functions is similar for these two potentials. The different variations of the VP lifetimes with vdW bending excitations for the different PES's should therefore be determined mainly by the difference in topology between the corresponding interaction potential matrix elements which couple the vibrational states of HF. Fig. 3 depicts Cartesian contour plots of the squared matrix elements 〈χv=1(r)|V(r,R,θ)|χv=0(r)〉r computed with the DIM and SLB V2 potentials. The vibrational couplings are similar in the vicinity of the global minimum at θ=0° for both potentials. That is why the lifetimes of the (1000) levels computed with the different potentials are similar (Table 3). The dependence of the vibrational couplings on R is quite different in the vicinity of the secondary minimum at θ=180°. The matrix element computed with the SLB potential decreases slowly with R and it has a significant magnitude at R as large as 4 Å. The coupling computed with the DIM potential vanishes rapidly as R becomes greater than 3 Å. This rapid variation stimulates the coupling between the bound and continuum vdW wave functions at small R distances and decreases the lifetime of the Σ-bending level. The slower variation of the SLB coupling may induce the VP less effectively. The largest difference between the two couplings is observed at θ close to 90° that is, in the region where the wave function of the Π-bending level is localized (see Fig. 2). The DIM coupling varies monotonically and the SLB coupling has a saddle point (minimum in the θ angle and maximum in the R coordinate). This reduces the magnitude of the coupling and makes the VP of the Π-bending level inefficient.
From Soup: 64 Rotational distributions after VP of the lowest vdW levels in the v = 1 state and two levels in the v = 3 state are presented in comparison with available experimental data 20 in Fig. 4 . The theoretical calculations show that about 90% of the VP products are formed in the highest accessible rotational state j ′ = 13. The peaks in the rotational distributions measured by Klemperer and co-workers 20 are less pronounced. The population of the j ′ = 13 state after VP of the (3000) level is 48%. The rotational distribution after VP of the (3110) level peaks at j ′ = 12. The same propensity was observed in our previous calculations but it was due to an approximate treatment of the asymptotic ro-vibrational energies of HF. 21

From Soup: 65 The calculated rotational distributions illustrate the near-resonant nature of VET in the Ar–HF system and they are in agreement with what was found in dynamical studies of Ar + HF collisions. 6–11,25–28 A high anisotropy of the Ar–HF interaction enables large changes of angular momentum and the conservation of the internal energy of the diatomic fragment. 25,26 It is instructive to compare the VP dynamics and the dynamics of vibrational relaxation in low-temperature collisions. At very low energies, the two processes become similar with respect to the initial energy of relative fragment motion, the total angular momentum, and orientation effects. 38 It may also be expected that the inelastic energy transfer at ultralow collision energies will be largely determined by the interaction potential and the dynamical effects will play minor role in the energy redistribution. Fig. 5 shows the rotational distributions of HF after VP of ArHF in the (1000) level and the HF( v = 1, j = 0) + Ar → HF( v = 0, j ′) reaction calculated with the DIM PES as described in ref. 25 . The distributions are similar and exhibit almost the same structure at low j ′.

From cou.: 66 The calculations of VP lifetimes for ArDF reveal a small isotope effect which is in agreement with results of experimental and theoretical studies of collisional VET12,13,25 and the experimental observation of the lifetimes by Oudejans et al.19 The calculations with the DIM PES give the reverse lifetime ratio for the (1100) and (1110) bending levels in the ArHF as compared to the ArDF complex.
From Soup: 66 When the ArHF complex is initially in high v -states, the near-resonant j ′ = 13 channel becomes closed and the energy gap between the initial level and the highest accessible decay channel increases significantly. As a result, the VP rate may undergo a sudden decrease. 21 In order to verify this prediction in more accurate calculations, the VP rates for ArHF in high v -states were computed with the DIM PES. Fig. 6 presents the halfwidths of several vdW levels as functions of v . The decay of the ( v 000) level decreases abruptly at v = 7. The distribution over the product states after VP of this level is similar to those shown in Fig. 4 but it peaks at j ′ = 12 that is the highest energetically open channel. The predissociation of the excited vdW levels needs less vibrational energy transferred and the shift of the peak in the final rotational distributions occurs at higher vibrational levels. The rate of VP increases to a great extent with the v quantum number, again in agreement with the studies of collisional VET. 27 This variation of the VP rates with v can be interpreted in terms of the correlation rules such as the exponential energy gap law 39 and the proportionality of the decay width to the squared red shift, which reflects the increase of the interaction strength with v . 40 A combination of these factors determines the VP dynamics of ArHF and the analytical expressions proposed in refs. 39 and 40 can not be applied to the present case separately.
 ###### 
From cou.: 67 Rotational distributions after VP of the lowest vdW levels in the v=1 state and two levels in the v=3 state are presented in comparison with available experimental data20 in Fig. 4. The theoretical calculations show that about 90% of the VP products are formed in the highest accessible rotational state j′=13. The peaks in the rotational distributions measured by Klemperer and co-workers20 are less pronounced. The population of the j′=13 state after VP of the (3000) level is 48%. The rotational distribution after VP of the (3110) level peaks at j′=12. The same propensity was observed in our previous calculations but it was due to an approximate treatment of the asymptotic ro-vibrational energies of HF.21
From Soup: 67 The rotational distributions of Fig. 4 computed with the DIM and SLB potentials are qualitatively different. The calculations with the SLB PES produce monotonic distributions over j ′ whereas the distributions obtained with the DIM potential show structure at low j ′-values. It is not clear which behavior is correct. These rotational distributions reflect the difference of the anisotropies of the SLB and DIM potentials, i.e. , their sharpness. The structure of the distributions calculated with the DIM PES is determined by the localization of the wave functions in the vdW complex ( Fig. 2 ) and by the anisotropy of the vibrational couplings. It may be noted, for example, that the product distributions after VP of the ( v 000) and ( v 001) levels are similar because both levels lie in the ground potential well. The VP of the complex in the the ( v 100) level produces significant fraction of molecules in low j ′ states. These molecules are formed due to the dissociation from the secondary minimum of the Ar–FH interaction. A heavy Ar atom departing linearly from the heavy part of the HF molecule can not induce significant rotational excitation. The rotational distributions presented in Fig. 4 should thus bear information not only on the magnitude of the potential wells but also on their shape and the accurate measurements of these distributions might provide details characterizing global features of the potential energy surfaces.

The distributions are similar and exhibit almost the same structure at low j′.

From Soup: 69 The calculations of vibrational energy levels and VP lifetimes provide a sensitive test of the accuracy of the interaction potentials. We examine the semiempirical potentials, constructed with two approaches: the diatomics-in-molecule method and the empirical refinement of ab initio calculations with reference to spectroscopic data. Although both PES's are somewhat less accurate than the best two-dimensional potential, they reproduce the vibrational spectra of the ArHF complex well. It is remarkable to see the performance of the ab initio -based potentials. Even simple morphing procedures provide reliable PES's and they can therefore be used as a powerful tool for constructing full-dimensional potentials for weakly-bound systems using the reference data obtained with potentials of lower dimensionality.

From cou.: 70 The rotational distributions of Fig. 4 computed with the DIM and SLB potentials are qualitatively different. The calculations with the SLB PES produce monotonic distributions over j′ whereas the distributions obtained with the DIM potential show structure at low j′-values. It is not clear which behavior is correct. These rotational distributions reflect the difference of the anisotropies of the SLB and DIM potentials, i.e., their sharpness. The structure of the distributions calculated with the DIM PES is determined by the localization of the wave functions in the vdW complex (Fig. 2) and by the anisotropy of the vibrational couplings.

From Soup: 70 The two types of potential energy surfaces implemented here originate in distinct approaches to electronic structure theory. The DIM method is related to the valence bond methodology and derives its advantages from the simple analytical formulation and the transparent physical meaning of the parameters of the potential. The ab initio MP2 method is a particularly well tested and generally successful example of the mainstream molecular orbital approach to electronic structure to which correlation effects have been added by perturbation theory. Both the DIM and the MP2 types of potentials require empirical refinement before use in our study of vibrational predissociation. This empirical input will compensate for different limitations of the original potentials. It is therefore not obvious which potential type shall be preferred on grounds of a priori arguments. We have instead chosen to draw our conclusions on the basis of the agreement obtained with experiment. It remains a relevant goal for future work to devise an optimal strategy for the construction and evaluation of interaction potentials based on fundamental grounds.

From cou.: 71 Vibrational spectra and vibrational predissociation dynamics of the ArHF complex in the lowest van der Waals levels corresponding to several vibrational states of HF are investigated using the best available semiempirical three-dimensional potential energy surfaces.
From Soup: 71 We conclude that the most accurate 3D potential for the Ar–HF interaction is the V 2 PES of Shroll et al. 24 This PES samples however only narrow ranges of radial variables and cannot be used for studies of vibrational energy transfer between high vibrational states. Although the vibrationally-elastic parts of the DIM and SLB potentials are similar, the anisotropy of the vibrational couplings computed with these potentials is quite different leading to a qualitatively different shape of the VP product state distributions. The lack of experimental information does not allow us to draw conclusions as to which of these potentials describes the angular dependence of the Ar–HF interaction better.

The lifetime of the ArHF complex in the ground level of v = 1 is in the range between 2.5 and 3 ms. There is only weak ArHF/ArDF isotope effect in the VP rates.

From cou.: 74 We conclude that the most accurate 3D potential for the Ar–HF interaction is the V2 PES of Shroll et al.24 This PES samples however only narrow ranges of radial variables and cannot be used for studies of vibrational energy transfer between high vibrational states. Although the vibrationally-elastic parts of the DIM and SLB potentials are similar, the anisotropy of the vibrational couplings computed with these potentials is quite different leading to a qualitatively different shape of the VP product state distributions. The lack of experimental information does not allow us to draw conclusions as to which of these potentials describes the angular dependence of the Ar–HF interaction better.
From Soup: 74 The efficiency of VP increases with vibrational excitation of the HF fragment v . This is determined by the decrease of the energy gap between the initial and final near-resonant levels and the increase of the interaction strength due to stretching of HF. The closing of the near-resonant decay channel that leads to a sudden increase of the energy gap may, however, result in the decrease of the VP rate with vibrational excitation of HF. The peak in the rotational population of products shifts from the j ′ = 13 to j ′ = 12 state and it occurs at v = 7.
 ###### 
From cou.: 75 Similarly to vibrational energy transfer in Ar+HF collisions, VP is a near-resonant process with a strong propensity for large angular momentum transfer. The lifetime of the ArHF complex in the ground level of v=1 is in the range between 2.5 and 3 ms. There is only weak ArHF/ArDF isotope effect in the VP rates.
From Soup: 75 Note added to proof: Very recently, another theoretical study of the ArHF VP dynamics on the original ab initio potential has been reported. 41 Many of its results are similar to the present findings. Also, an important paper 42 presenting accurate 3D ab initio potential has been missed in the discussion. We thank Prof. van der Avoird for bringing it to our attention.
