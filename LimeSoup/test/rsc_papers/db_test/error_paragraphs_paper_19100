From cou.: 1 The cytochrome P450s are versatile enzymes that catalyze a range of monoxygenation reactions. Their catalytic cycle includes molecular oxygen binding and two reduction and protonation steps to create the active species, Compound I. In an anaerobic environment, however, only two reduction steps starting from the resting state can take place. Currently, very little information is known on this doubly-reduced species; therefore, we have performed a detailed density functional theory (DFT) and combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) study on this complex. In principle, the doubly-reduced pentacoordinated heme can exist in two possible electronic configurations, namely an Fe(I) with closed-shell heme or an Fe(II) coupled to a heme anion radical [FeII Por−˙]. Our calculations show that there are several close-lying spin states with a [FeII Por−˙] configuration and these states are much lower in energy than the alternative [FeI Por0] situation. We have calculated spectroscopic parameters of the lowest lying sextet spin state, including IR spectra and EPR parameters.

From cou.: 2 The cytochrome P450s are ubiquitous heme enzymes involved in important bioprocesses in the body, such as the metabolism of drugs, the biosynthesis of hormones and detoxification processes in the liver.1–4 As such, a lot of work has been devoted to the understanding of the mechanism of substrate oxidation by these enzymes. Generally, the P450s are heme enzymes that bind and utilize molecular oxygen and react with substrates as a monoxygenase.1,5,6 However, despite extensive searches, its active oxidant remains elusive, although indirect evidence through kinetic isotope effects and product distributions point to an iron(IV)–oxo porphyrin cation radical (Compound I, Cpd I) as the most likely oxidant.7,8 These studies are supported by theoretical modeling that indeed predicted the iron(IV)–oxo porphyrin cation radical intermediate in the catalytic cycle as an efficient oxidant of C–H hydroxylation, epoxidation and sulfoxidation reactions.9–12 The P450s undergo a complicated catalytic cycle that starts from the resting state, where a water molecule is bound to the heme (Scheme 1). However, this water molecule is displaced after substrate (SubH) binding, which triggers a low-spin to high-spin transition of the heme to form structure R.13 Subsequently, the heme is reduced to give an Fe(II) pentacoordinated heme (S). Under normal aerobic conditions this intermediate binds molecular oxygen, followed by another reduction step and two protonation processes to give Cpd I, the active oxidant.14–16 However, under anaerobic conditions the catalytic cycle cannot proceed beyond S, although the heme can be reduced further to structure D, the doubly-reduced pentacoordinated complex. Recently, D was identified with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron–nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) techniques.17 It has been proposed that it may consist of either an Fe(II) coupled to a heme anion radical, [FeII Por−˙] (D), or alternatively as an FeI with a closed-shell heme, [FeI Por0] (D′).

From cou.: 3 Currently, it is unclear which of these electronic configurations corresponds to the pentacoordinated structure. However, if it is the [FeII Por−˙], it would be the only P450 structure apart from Cpd I that contains a heme-based radical. Thus, to gain insight into this doubly-reduced pentacoordinated system and establish its spectroscopic properties, we have performed a series of density functional theory (DFT) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations on its structure and properties which we report in this work.

P450BM3 is a bacterial P450 enzyme that closely resembles human P450s and, as such, has been the focus of many experimental studies.18,19 P450BM3 catalyzes the hydroxylation of long chain fatty acids, such as N-palmitoylglycine and its active site is characterized by a central iron atom embedded in a heme group that is linked to the protein backbone via a thiolate linkage with a cysteinate group (Cys400). Our studies focused on the following questions: (a) what is the electronic state of the doubly reduced pentacoordinated system, is it Fe(I) heme or an Fe(II) heme anion radical? (b) How does the surrounding protein influence spin state ordering and spectroscopic parameters?

From cou.: 6 Initial DFT studies were done on a small active site model of cytochrome P450 comprising iron–protoporphyrin IX (without side chains) and the axial cysteinate ligand replaced by thiolate, similar to previous studies of ours and others in the field.20–23 This minimal model of D has the stoichiometry FeC20H13N4S, overall charge −2 and spin multiplicity doublet, quartet or sextet. Full geometry optimizations were performed in Jaguar 7.0 with the unrestricted hybrid density functional method (UB3LYP).24–26 These studies used a modest Los Alamos-type double-ζ quality basis set LACVP on iron that includes a core potential, while all other atoms are described by a 6-31G basis set: basis set B1.27 Subsequent single point calculations with LACV3P+ on iron and 6-311++G** on the rest of the atoms confirmed the electronic situations and relative energies, designated LACV3P++** or basis set B2. Analytical frequency calculations at the UB3LYP/B1 level of theory confirmed the structures as local minima and were performed in GAUSSIAN 03.28 All frequencies reported in this work were scaled with a factor of 0.9614 as proposed by Scott and Radom.29 To test the effect of the basis set on the optimized geometries, all structures were reoptimized in GAUSSIAN using the LACVP** basis set, basis set B3.

From cou.: 7 To test the effects of the environment on the relative energies and spin state ordering of the structures, we carried out additional single point calculations on the optimized gas phase geometries using (i) a dielectric constant, (ii) the addition of two hydrogen bonded ammonia molecules pointing toward the thiolate that mimic the interactions in the protein, (iii) a combination of the effects described in (i) and (ii), and (iv) full quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) optimizations (see next section for details). The calculations done with a dielectric constant follow similar procedures as we used before in Jaguar 7.0, using the self-consistent reaction field model,30–32 whereby three different dielectric constants with values of ε = 5.708 (probe radius = 2.72 Å), ε = 35.74 (probe radius = 2.73 Å) and ε = 80.37 (probe radius = 1.40 Å) were employed. Our previous work showed that the electronic description of the thiolate ligand, in particular of Cpd I, is strongly influenced by hydrogen bonding interactions as they appear in the protein.33 In the past, we mimicked these interactions faithfully by the addition of two hydrogen-bonded ammonia molecules pointing toward the thiolate group.34,35 To test the effect of hydrogen bonding toward the thiolate in the studies presented here, we took the geometries of these ammonia molecules from ref. 33 and added those to our optimized geometries and ran a single point calculation at the UB3LYP/B1 level of theory.

From cou.: 8 In addition, we tested the effect of an applied electric field on the spin state ordering and electronic descriptions. This was done using literature procedures36–38 by the addition of an electric field along one of the principal axes of the molecule. Here, applied electric fields in the range of ±0.015 au (±77 MV cm−1) are used, whereas typical values of induced electric fields by a protein are 10 MV cm−1. The applied electric field effects studied here should therefore be seen as upper values to what may be expected in the protein.

From cou.: 9 These methods have been commonly used in our groups and were carefully benchmarked against experimental data. Thus, for a range of hydrogen abstraction barriers by iron(IV)–oxo oxidants, a linear correlation with C–H bond dissociation energy of the substrate was found, with a spread of energies of 1–2 kcal mol−1.39,40 Moreover, experimentally-determined free energies of activation were reproduced within 3 kcal mol−1 with B3LYP calculations.41–44 Further assessment of the computational data against experimentally-determined kinetic isotope effects of hydrogen abstraction reactions and spectroscopic data were favourable.45,46

From cou.: 10 In addition, we ran a series of benchmark studies using alternative density functional methods to ascertain whether B3LYP can correctly reproduce spin state ordering and relative energies of these iron–porphyrin complexes. Single point calculations were performed on the B3LYP/B1 optimized geometries using GAUSSIAN 03, employing either the BP86,47,48 OPBE,49,50 PW91B95,51,52 B3P86,25,48 B3PW91,25,51 or B3LYP with 15% exchange included. It has been suggested that, for transition metal complexes, 15% exchange provides more accurate energetics.53,54 However, in our calculations only minor differences from the B3LYP results are found. Thus, all methods predict the doublet spin state below the quartet while doublet–quartet energy gaps of ΔEDQ = 3.6, 7.4, 6.0, 7.8, 1.6, 2.1 and 4.3 kcal mol−1 are found for B3LYP, BP86, OPBE, PW91B95, B3P86, B3PW91 and B3LYP(15% exchange), respectively. Furthermore, the doublet–sextet energy difference is −5.6, −1.8, −6.8, −9.3 and −2.9 kcal mol−1 for B3LYP, OPBE, B3P86, B3PW91 and B3LYP(15% exchange) in favor of the sextet spin state. Thus, alternative DFT methods reproduce the spin state ordering and give the same low-lying electronic states with the same orbital occupation. Moreover, the B3LYP result is the closest to the median value in most cases and therefore the most appropriate to use.

From cou.: 11 Full QM/MM calculations started from a substrate-free P450BM3 structure55 and followed previous procedures in the field.56–58 The starting point of the calculations was taken from ref. 58, which includes monomer A of the 1JPZ pdb file, and where the substrate N-palmitoylglycine is replaced by dimethylsulfide and hydrogen atoms added to the protein. The protonation state of all histidine residues was carefully checked: His66, His123, His210, His287 were protonated at the ND1 atom only, His397 was protonated on the NE2 atom only, and all other histidine amino acids were taken as doubly protonated. The system was solvated in a 15 Å layer of water molecules in a truncated octahedral box with a total of about 52000 atoms and a net charge of −9. Subsequently, a molecular dynamics equilibration at 300 K was carried out for 400 ps in AMBER using the FF94 force field.59,60 After equilibration, structures were analyzed and low energy snapshots were selected from the molecular dynamics simulations and used as a starting point for the QM/MM calculations. The protein and a 5 Å layer of solvent (water) molecules was selected to create a system with a total of 10179 atoms. The QM region contains the heme without side chains, iron and thiolate for cysteinate. Full geometry optimizations on all atoms in the system (QM as well as MM region) were performed in the doublet, quartet and sextet spin states using the ONIOM program package61 as implemented in GAUSSIAN 03.28 The QM region was described with UB3LYP/LANL2DZ, and the MM region with a UFF force field.62 We also tested the use of Amber for the MM region but very little difference was found with respect to the UFF results.58 Initial calculations used the LANL2DZ basis set (basis set B1), but additional single point calculations with an LACVP** basis set (basis set B3) were performed to confirm the energetics. These calculations did not change the spin state ordering and relative energies. ONIOM uses the link-atom method that replaces a covalent bond on the boundary between the QM and MM regions with a C–H bond,63 and includes mechanical embedding of the protein into the QM region. We ran single point calculations on the optimized doublet, quartet and sextet spin state structures, including electronic embedding of the MM region into the QM Hamiltonian. Relative energies obtained were 0.0, 1.2 and −4.8 kcal mol−1 for the doublet, quartet and sextet, respectively, whereas values of 0.0, 2.5 and −4.1 kcal mol−1 were found with mechanical embedding only. Therefore, electronic embedding has very little effect on the relative energies of the individual spin states and the spin state ordering.

From cou.: 13 Substrate binding to the active site of P450 enzymes releases the water molecule from the sixth binding site of the active site heme to give a pentacoordinated iron(III)-heme, R. This process is accomplished with a doublet to sextet spin state crossing that triggers an electron transfer process from the reductase domain to the active center to form S.13,66 In our system, the pentacoordinated system is doubly-reduced, D. Let us first start with a description of the electron transfer processes in these reduction mechanisms. Fig. 1 shows the high-lying occupied and low-lying virtual orbitals of the pentacoordinated iron–heme systems as they appear in e.g.cytochrome P450 enzymes, as well as the electron transfer processes for the two reduction steps starting from R, via the singly reduced pentacoordinated species (S) leading to D.

From cou.: 14 On the right-hand-side of Fig. 1 we show the orbitals originating from the 3d metal orbitals, which split into the typical 3t2g− 2eg pattern of orbitals with three low-lying nonbonding orbitals on the metal (3dxy, 3dxz and 3dyz) and two higher lying antibonding orbitals (σ*x2−y2 and σ*z2). The two σ* orbitals result from the antibonding combination of the mixing of the 3dx2−y2 orbital on iron with 2p orbitals on the four nitrogen atoms of the heme (in σ*x2−y2) and through mixing of the 3dz2 orbital on iron with a lone pair orbital on the thiolate (in σ*z2). On the top, we show one of the virtual heme-type orbitals of R, with eg symmetry labeled as eg*. This pair of eg* orbitals is virtual in the resting state (R) and its reduced form (S) but these orbitals become accessible for D. This set of orbitals is occupied by five electrons in R in an overall sextet, quartet or doublet spin state with either configuration 6R = 3dxy1 3dxz1 3dyz1σ*z21σ*x2−y21, 4R = 3dxy2 3dxz1 3dyz1σ*z21 or 2R = 3dxy2 3dxz2 3dyz1 (Fig. 1). In all three spin states, the metal 3d block is occupied by five electrons, hence the metal is in oxidation state FeIII, regardless of the overall spin state. EPR spectroscopy studies showed that, with a water molecule in the sixth binding site, the ground state is doublet spin state (2R), but in the pentacoordinated form, the sextet state is the ground state.13,66 DFT and QM/MM studies confirmed this spin state ordering.67–69

From cou.: 15 Also given in Fig. 1 are the electron transfer processes from 2,4,6R to form 1,3,5S. A one-electron reduction of 6R gives a quintet spin state structure, and filling of the 3dxy orbital with a second electron results in occupation 5S = 3dxy2 3dxz1 3dyz1σ*z21σ*x2−y21. By contrast, reduction of 4R can also give this 5S state or, alternatively, the 3S state with occupation 3dxy2 3dxz2 3dyz1σ*z21. Reduction of 2R connects to the 3S state as well or gives a closed-shell singlet (1S) with occupation 3dxy2 3dxz2 3dyz2.

A one-electron reduction of 6 R gives a quintet spin state structure, and filling of the 3d xy orbital with a second electron results in occupation 5 S = 3d xy 2 3d xz 1 3d yz 1 σ* z 2 1 σ* x 2 − y 2 1 . By contrast, reduction of 4 R can also give this 5 S state or, alternatively, the 3 S state with occupation 3d xy 2 3d xz 2 3d yz 1 σ* z 2 1 . Reduction of 2 R connects to the 3 S state as well or gives a closed-shell singlet ( 1 S ) with occupation 3d xy 2 3d xz 2 3d yz 2 .

From cou.: 16 In this work, we studied systems that are reduced further with one more electron to give D, which gives a multitude of possible electronic configurations and some of these are given in Fig. 1. For example, a one-electron reduction of 5S can lead to an electron transfer into a low-lying virtual heme orbital, such as eg*, to give 4,6D = 3dxy2 3dxz1 3dyz1σ*z21σ*x2−y21 eg*1. In this case, the spin in the eg* orbital is ferromagnetically coupled to the metal based spins into an overall sextet spin state (in 6D) or antiferromagnetically coupled into an overall quartet spin state (in 4D). These two electronic states have the metal in oxidation state FeII and the porphyrin group singly-reduced (FeII Por−˙). Alternatively, the extra electron can be donated into the 3d metal system (into 3dxz) to create an electronic situation with the metal in oxidation state FeI and a neutral heme (4D′ = FeI Por0). This state is also accessible through the reduction of 3S. In addition, reduction of 3S can give rise to a pair of degenerate doublet and quartet spin states with occupation 2,4D′′ = 3dxy2 3dxz2 3dyz1σ*z21 eg*1.

From cou.: 17 DFT and QM/MM optimized geometries of D of the lowest-lying doublet, quartet, and sextet spin states are shown in Fig. 2. In all cases, the sextet spin state is the ground state with the doublet and quartet spin states at least 5.5 kcal mol−1 higher. With the small DFT model, 6D is considerably more stable than the doublet and quartet spin state structures. The latter two states are characterized as 2,4D′′ with 3dxy2 3dxz2 3dyz1σ*z21 eg*1 configuration. This assignment is supported by the group spin densities (ρ) shown in Fig. 2. The relative energies between 6D and 4,2D′′ are equally perturbed by the MM region and the energy difference from an MM calculation on the full structure and an MM calculation on the QM region is less than 0.6 kcal mol−1.

From cou.: 18 Using the DFT model complex, we also located 4D with electronic configuration 3dxy2 3dxz1 3dyz1σ*z21σ*x2−y21 eg*1 that was found to be isoenergetic to 6D, however, attempts to locate 4D in QM/MM failed and converged back to 4D′′ instead. Nevertheless, it is clear from both DFT and QM/MM that the ground state of D is an [FeII Por−˙]. All attempts to find an electronic state with overall quartet or doublet spin with the metal in oxidation state FeI as in 4,2D′ (Fig. 1) failed and each time converged back to one of the [FeII Por−˙] situations described above. A time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation on the optimized doublet and quartet spin state geometries implicated that the excitations from the [FeII Por−˙] state to the lowest lying FeI solution requires 52.3 and 53.4 kcal mol−1, respectively, and represents an excitation of a β-spin electron from eg* to σ*x2−y2 (quartet) to form 4D′ or an excitation to 3dyz (doublet) to form 2D′. Although TD-DFT may considerably overestimate these relative energies, it is clear that the [FeI Por0] solution is a high-lying excited state that will not be accessible to the protein. Note that no low-lying sextet spin state can form an FeI solution due to an already fully occupied 3d metal block. Thus, the FeI oxidation states are high-lying electronic states that will not be accessible in the gas phase.

From cou.: 19 Optimized geometries obtained with the small DFT model compare well with full QM/MM calculations. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the Fe–S distance is relatively long (>2.5 Å) and the iron is significantly displaced from the plane of the heme. This is presumably due to the fact that the sixth ligand site of the metal is vacant and the thiolate pulls the iron below the plane of the heme, a fact that has been shown before in pentacoordinated systems.10,68,69,71,72 Thus, Altun and Thiel69 find QM/MM optimized geometries with Fe–S distances of 2.349 and 2.413 Å for 6,4R. Our system, however, has two extra electrons in the 3d metal system and, in particular, filling of the σ*z2 orbital with one electron enhances the Fe–S bond significantly. Therefore, our optimized geometries are in good agreement with related structures from the literature. The sextet spin state has considerably smaller Fe–S distances of 2.557 (DFT) and 2.556 (QM/MM) Å than those obtained in the doublet and quartet spin states, where values around 2.7 Å (QM/MM) are found. These differences in Fe–S bond length lead to a shift of the Fe–S stretch vibration that shifts from 223.7 cm−1 for the sextet spin structure to 137.3 (quartet) and 131.5 (doublet) cm−1.

From cou.: 20 In order to find out what the effect of the environment is on the relative energies of the various spin states and whether a system with an FeI oxidation state, such as 4,2D′, can be stabilized in a more polar environment, we did an extensive set of extra calculations that take the perturbation due to the local environment into effect. Firstly, we studied the doublet, quartet and sextet spin state structures in a dielectric constant (ε) ranging in magnitude from 5.7 to 80. Fig. 3 shows the group spin densities (ρ) and relative energies of the doubly-reduced pentacoordinated systems in the doublet, quartet and sextet spin states as obtained in dielectric constants ranging from ε = 5.7 to 80.3 (water). As follows from Fig. 3, the group spin densities are virtually the same regardless of the dielectric constant and imply that the electronic state and orbital occupation stays the same regardless of whether a polar environment is applied to the system. Moreover, the spin densities obtained from the dielectric constant calculations are close to the gas phase and QM/MM data reported above in Fig. 2. Note that in a dielectric constant, 2D′′ is stabilized with respect to the gas phase and QM/MM energies shown above in Fig. 2. Interestingly, in a dielectric constant mimicking a water solution, 2D′′ becomes the ground state, although only by a small margin. Therefore, a dielectric constant changes the spin state ordering of the individual electronic states. However, the protein in the enzyme will induce a dielectricum on the active site that is far below that of water, so that a sextet spin state is more likely in the enzyme, in agreement with the QM/MM studies reported above.

From cou.: 21 Further studies with the addition of two hydrogen-bonded ammonia molecules that mimic the hydrogen bonding interactions toward the thiolate ligand in the protein environment were performed for the sextet spin state. The thus-obtained group spin densities in the gas phase, as well as with an additional dielectric constant specified, gave group spin densities that are virtually identical to those shown in Fig. 3 for the systems without hydrogen-bonded ammonia molecules. This is not surprising because the thiolate ligand is closed shell in all systems studied here and only participates in the singly occupied σ*z2 orbital. Calculations on CpdI of P450 showed that it has a singly-occupied molecular orbital with mixed heme and thiolate character.33Hydrogen bonding interactions toward the thiolate in the case of CpdI change the ratio of hemeversus thiolate character of this singly occupied orbital and thereby change the group spin densities and charges.33 Here, the effect of these hydrogen bonding interactions is negligible, as also follows from the difference between the DFT and QM/MM optimized geometries shown in Fig. 2.

From cou.: 22 Subsequently, we tested the effect of an applied electric field on the charge and spin distributions of the systems, see Fig. 4. It was shown that an applied electric field effect can change the charge and spin distributions of heme systems and thereby influence the regioselectivity of CC double bond epoxidationversus C–H hydroxylation.36 Moreover, DFT calculations on cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) CpdI predicted a situation in the gas phase with two unpaired electrons on the metal coupled to a protein radical on a nearby tryptophan residue.37 However, the calculations showed that with an applied electric field on CcP CpdI, the system changed from a tryptophan radical to a heme radical due to these perturbations.37

From cou.: 23 The calculations on 6D with an external electric field along the molecular x-, y-, or z-axis changes the group spin densities and charges by less than 5% (see Fig. 4). In particular, an applied electric field along the x- or y-axis has negligible effect on the group spin densities and relative energies. Although some minor changes in spin densities are observed with a field along the z-axis, this does not change the electronic state of any of the spin states studied. A field along the z-axis displaces spin density from the thiolate to the heme and iron groups. Therefore, in the gas phase, as well as under environmental perturbations, the lowest lying configuration is [FeII Por−˙], generally with a 6D ground state. Perturbations through an external electric field, a dielectric constant or hydrogen bonding do not change the nature of the electronic ground state and this orbital occupation and oxidation state are retained. Furthermore, no evidence of a low-lying electronic state with the metal in oxidation state Fe(I) is found.

From cou.: 24 Finally, to check that the nature of the density functional method does not influence the results, we reoptimized the structures with the PBE0 and BP86 density functionals instead.48,50 The spin state ordering obtained with PBE0 is similar to that found with the B3LYP density functional, but with BP86 the ordering of the spin states is reversed and the doublet spin state is the ground state. Nevertheless, all methods predict an [FeII Por−˙] ground state with close-lying spin states.

From cou.: 25 In summary, we performed an extensive set of calculations on DFT model complexes with various external perturbations included (see above). Addition of a dielectric constant or hydrogen bonding interactions to the thiolate group do not change the spin state ordering or give evidence of a low-lying [FeI Por0] complex. Subsequent calculations with an applied electric field along the molecular x-, y- or z-axis also did not lead to an [FeI Por0] solution. It appears, therefore, that the [FeI Por0] solution is a high-lying excited state that will not be accessible in the protein.

From cou.: 26 Subsequently, we decided to calculate several spectroscopic parameters of our ground state structures. First, we focused on the zero-field splitting (ZFS), which can be described as a function of spin–orbit coupling factors arising from excited state contributions with equal overall spin to the ground state or one spin unit higher or lower than the ground state.64 In our case, the ground state is the sextet spin state and all orbitals shown in Fig. 1 above are occupied with at least one electron. As a consequence, excitations from the sextet to the lowest-lying octet spin state require an excitation to a high-lying orbital and its contribution to the ZFS value will be negligible. Therefore, only excitations from the ground state sextet and higher-lying sextet and quartet spin states have been considered here. The ZFS value Di is estimated using a common literature procedure,64,65 which we will briefly summarize here. Thus, Di contains contributions of one-electron excitations to other sextet spin states or quartet spin states as described by eqn (1). In eqn (1), Δi is the vertical excitation energy from the sextet ground state. The sextet spin state values were determined from TD-DFT calculations on the ground state. The lowest excitation leading to a quartet spin state gives the 4D′′ structure described above in Fig. 1 and 2 and has Δi = 7.5 kcal mol−1 (2623 cm−1). All other quartet spin excitations were determined from a TD-DFT calculation on 4D′′. The covalency factors (γi) for each of the orbitals shown above in Fig. 1 are determined from orbital occupations of the natural orbital analysis and the spin–orbit coupling constant (ζ) is taken as 500 cm−1.73

From Soup: 42 In a similar fashion, we determined EPR parameters for the sextet spin ground state. Thus, the in-plane components of the magnetic g -tensor are affected by spin–orbit coupling due to excitations from the ground state to higher lying sextet spin states via g x = g y = g ⊥ = g e + Δ g ⊥ with g e being the value for the free electron. Similarly to eqn (1) above, the term Δ g ⊥ can be estimated using TD-DFT from the vertical excitation energies, Δ i , as described by eqn (2) . In this particular case, excitations from a half-filled orbital into an empty one have a negative sign, while those from a filled to a half-filled orbital have positive sign. All transitions shown in Table 1 correspond to transitions from a filled to a half-filled orbital and give a value Δ g ⊥ = 0.20 and g ⊥ = 2.20. This value is in excellent agreement with the experimentally-determined EPR value of Davydov and Hoffman 17 on this species, who reported a value g ⊥ = 2.25.

From Soup: 118 Thus, the lowest sextet spin excitations correspond to 3d → 3d /3d , and somewhat higher in energy is the 3d →σ* excitation. All other sextet spin excitations were found to be well above 10 000 cm and were therefore ignored. One electron excitations from a sextet to a quartet spin state correspond to σ* → 3d /3d , whereas all other excitations are much higher in energy. In this way, the sum of all values in enables us to estimate a ZFS value of 58.8 cm for structure .
