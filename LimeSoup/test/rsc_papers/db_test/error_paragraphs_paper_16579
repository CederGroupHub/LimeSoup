From cou.: 1 The correct diagnosis and the prompt treatment of oral leukoplakia (OLK) can efficiently prevent OLK from undergoing malignant transformation to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, the diagnostic model for distinguishing normal mucosa from low-grade dysplasia, as well as high-grade dysplasia from OSCC was not well established in a previous study. In this study, the characteristic wavenumbers in the Raman spectra were first identified by the variable selection methods. Then, the intensities at these wavenumbers were used to classify the biopsies. As a result, the accuracies achieved by the intensities at the characteristic wavenumbers were 70.5% and 94.0% for the classification of normal vs. low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC, respectively, which were greater than those (accuracy of 65.4% and 88.0%, respectively) using all the intensities in the Raman spectra. Our results suggested that constructing a diagnostic model with the intensities at the characteristic wavenumbers can improve the identification of the different lesions of oral mucosa. Moreover, most of the Raman intensities for predicting normal vs. low-grade dysplasia indicated that the transformation from normal mucosa to low-grade dysplasia was associated with the changes in the contents of lipids, while most of the intensities for predicting high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC indicated that the transformation from high-grade dysplasia to OSCC was associated with changes in the contents of proteins and nucleic acids. Our findings can be helpful for diagnosing the various grades of OLK with dysplasia and understanding the molecular mechanisms of potential malignant transformation of oral leukoplakia.

From cou.: 2 Oral leukoplakia (OLK) is defined as “a white plaques of questionable risk having excluded (other) known diseases or disorders that carry no increased risk for cancer”1 and is one of the most common disease of oral mucosa. Moreover, it is well known that OLK is the most common precancerous lesion of the oral mucosa with a higher tendency of malignant transformation to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).2–5 The development of OLK in potential malignant transformation is through a multistep process followed by varying the grades of oral dysplasia.6,7 The presence of oral dysplasia may be a significant predictor for malignant transformation of oral leukoplakia. In addition, there is a general agreement that high-grade dysplasia have significantly higher malignant incidence than low-grade dysplasia.8,9 Therefore, the correct detection of various grades of oral dysplasia is a high priority for reducing malignant transformations.

From cou.: 3 However, the histological features of various grades of dysplasia are not always significantly different, and the exact mechanism of malignant transformation is still unknown. The low-grade dysplasia in oral leukoplakia cannot be easily diagnosed because there is no significant difference in pathological manifestation between low-grade dysplasia and normal mucosa. Simultaneously, high-grade dysplasia has a strong tendency for malignant transformation and the pathological manifestations in the tissue are similar to those in the OSCC. The histological investigation of high-grade dysplasia in oral leukoplakia could be easily misdiagnosed as a carcinoma lesion.10 Thus, it is important to accurately diagnose the grades of oral dysplasia. Nowadays, researchers and pathologists are eager to discover the exact mechanisms of malignant transformation in OLK and hope to effectively build the diagnostic models of OLK and OSCC.

From cou.: 4 Gene expression signatures have a functional relevance to cancers. In recent years, several studies have been carried out to reveal the prognostic markers and build diagnostic models of OLK and OSCC based on gene expression data. Mario et al. measured the expression levels of ATP6V1C1 in OSCC patients and the healthy persons, and used this gene as a prognostic marker to discriminate between OSCC and normal mucosa.11 Chang et al. investigated the pathogenetic implications of miR-211 in oral carcinogenesis.12 They determined that a high expression level of miR-211 was associated with the most advanced nodal metastasis, vascular invasion, and poor treatment outcomes of OSCC. Tang et al. evaluated the changes in the expression levels of six well-documented long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are associated with cancer in saliva samples obtained from OSCC patients and suggested that lncRNAs in saliva can be used as a potential diagnostic marker for OSCC diagnosis.13 Although the gene biomarkers were continuously discovered for diagnosing the OSCC, this method still lacks a diagnostic model for discriminating grades of dysplasia in OLK.

From cou.: 5 The occurrence of malignant transformation is usually caused by changes in the contents of biomolecules, such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. These changes can provide an opportunity for a spectrometer to capture the characteristics involved in the pathological manifestation of biological samples. The vibrational spectroscopy techniques can capture the molecular fingerprint of specific molecular structures and conformations of biomolecules in tissue samples. For the last few years, Raman spectroscopy and NIR spectroscopy have been successfully used in cancer and pre-cancer research, such as the diagnoses of premalignant and malignant tumor in epithelial tissues,14–16 stomach,17–19 brain,20 oral21–23 and skin.24,25 Moreover, various algorithms in chemometrics, such as uninformative variable elimination (UVE), Monte Carlo based UVE (MC-UVE), randomization test (RT), Bayesian variable selection, variable importance projection (VIP), locally linear embedding (LLE),26–32 have been widely applied to the measured Raman and NIR spectra for selecting characteristic wavenumbers and building the diagnostic models. In our previous works,33 we established diagnostic models using the Raman spectra generated by Fourier transform near-infrared (FTNIR) Raman spectrometer. The diagnostic models performed well in discriminating normal mucosa from OLK and OSCC. However, the normal versus the low-grade dysplasia, as well as the high-grade dysplasia versus OSCC cannot be accurately classified because of the high similarity of the Raman spectra of the biopsies of these two groups.

From cou.: 6 In the current study, with the purpose of improving the model performance, we first identified the characteristic wavenumbers for which the Raman intensities were significantly different between the compared biopsies. Then, the intensities at the characteristic wavenumbers were used as features to construct predictive models. Two variable selection methods, namely, ReliefF and OneR, were used to evaluate the importance of the spectral wavenumbers, and two classification algorithms, namely, Random Forest and Logistic Regression, were used to classify the two groups of compared tissues. As a result, depending on the characteristic wavenumbers, we can not only discriminate the normal mucosa from the low-grade dysplasia with an accuracy of 70.5% for a testing set, but also discriminate high-grade dysplasia from OSCC with an accuracy of 94.0% for a testing set. Moreover, we determined the transformation from the normal tissues to the low-grade dysplasia was associated with changes in lipids. The intensity at spectral wavenumber ranging from 300 to 600 cm−1 in normal mucosa was higher compared to low-grade dysplasia, which indicated that lipids may mainly dominate in normal oral mucosa tissues. The transformation from high-grade dysplasia to the OSCC was associated with changes in collagens and nucleic acids.

All the samples were fixed by 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Five parallel 5 μm formalin-fixed paraffin preserved (FFPP) sections were cut from each block using a microtome, and one of them was randomly selected to be mounted on glass slides, dewaxed and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) as the reference section for pathological verification. Another 10 μm FFPP sections were cut from each block using a microtome, and one of them was randomly selected to be mounted on custom CaF2 chips, dewaxed and air-dried as the Raman spectral sections for Raman spectral investigations. All the tissue sections were characterized by a pathologist from the Department of Pathology, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University. More details about the methods for dealing with tissue samples have been previously published.33

For the purpose of selecting the suitable classification algorithms for the two comparison groups, we first used both algorithms to discriminate the grades of oral dysplasia with the full spectrum as features. The predictive models were validated by leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Then, we chose a suitable variable selection method for the classification of normal vs. low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC to identify the characteristic wavenumbers, for which the intensities were used as features to build the models. In this procedure, the models were validated by a 5-fold cross-validation. Finally, the diagnostic models were constructed using the optimal variable selection method and classification algorithm, and validated by LOOCV. The prediction accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) were considered as the performance metrics and calculated using the following equation: where TP, FP, TN and FN denote the number of true-positive, false-positive, true-negative and false-negative, respectively.

From Soup: 36 The random forest algorithm 40 is an ensemble classification method, which is widely applied for classification due to its robustness against overfitting and good tolerance to outliers and noise. The key idea of the random forest is to improve the performance of the ensemble classification via majority voting to perform prediction. Ntree and Mtry are two parameters in the random forest algorithm, which determines the number of individual trees and the number of features that are randomly selected for each of the trees, respectively. We set Ntree at 10 and Mtry at log 2 N + 1 by default in WEKA to grow the ensemble trees, where N is the number of features in the dataset. Each of the trees is grown to the largest extent possible, without pruning according to the CART methodology. 41,42

From Soup: 39 A total of 128 spectra were collected from the tissue samples, including 45 Raman spectra from normal mucosa, 33 from low-grade dysplasia, 31 Raman spectra from high-grade dysplasia, and 19 from OSCC. The predictive models were constructed to discriminate the normal mucosa from the low-grade dysplasia tissue (normal vs. low-grade dysplasia) and discriminate the high-grade dysplasia tissue from OSCC (high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC). Fig. 1 shows the Raman spectra of four types of tissues in these two compared groups. The mean spectra of the four types of tissues were calculated and the subtracted mean spectra of the two compared groups are shown in Fig. 2 . The main differences in the subtracted spectra between the normal mucosa and the low-grade dysplasia were located in the region ranging from 300 to 600 cm −1 ( Fig. 2A ), while the differences between the high-grade dysplasia and OSCC were located in the region ranging from 700 to 1100 cm −1 ( Fig. 2B ).

From Soup: 40 For the comparisons of normal vs. low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC, the diagnostic models were separately constructed using random forest and logistic regression with all the Raman intensities, and validated by the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method. The prediction results were listed in Table 2 . For the classification of normal vs. low-grade dysplasia, the random forest algorithm performed better (accuracy = 65.4%) compared to the logistic regression algorithm (accuracy = 48.7%), while for the classification of high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC, the logistic regression algorithm is better (accuracy = 88.0% and 74.0% for the logistic regression algorithm and the random forest algorithm, respectively). Therefore, in the subsequent analysis, we used the random forest algorithm to discriminate normal mucosa from low-grade dysplasia and used the logistic regression algorithm for the discrimination of high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC.

From cou.: 41 2.4.1 Random forest.
From Soup: 41 In order to improve the performance of models, two variable selection methods, namely OneR and ReliefF, were involved in our study to evaluate the importance of the features and only the intensities at the characteristic wavenumbers were used to build the models. For each of the comparison groups, both two variable selection methods were applied to identifying the characteristic wavenumbers and the prediction results with the intensities at the characteristic wavenumbers are listed in Table 3 . When discriminating the normal mucosa from the low-grade dysplasia, the construction of models with features selected by OneR performed better (accuracy = 82.5%) compared to those with features selected by ReliefF (accuracy = 72.4%). With regard to the classification of high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC, it is better to construct models with features selected by ReliefF (accuracy = 94.7% and 89.3% for ReliefF and OneR, respectively). Consequently, we build the diagnostic model for the classification of normal vs. low-grade dysplasia using a random forest algorithm combined with OneR, while building the model for the classification of high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC using the logistic regression algorithm combined with ReliefF. The models were validated using LOOCV. The prediction results achieved by the diagnostic models are listed in Table 4 . Compared with the prediction results achieved by the diagnostic models that were constructed using all the Raman intensities ( Table 2 ), the accuracies achieved by the models constructed with the intensities at the characteristic wavenumbers (70.5% and 94.0% for the classification of normal vs. low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC, respectively) were higher than those listed in Table 2 .

From cou.: 42 The random forest algorithm40 is an ensemble classification method, which is widely applied for classification due to its robustness against overfitting and good tolerance to outliers and noise. The key idea of the random forest is to improve the performance of the ensemble classification via majority voting to perform prediction. Ntree and Mtry are two parameters in the random forest algorithm, which determines the number of individual trees and the number of features that are randomly selected for each of the trees, respectively. We set Ntree at 10 and Mtry at log2N + 1 by default in WEKA to grow the ensemble trees, where N is the number of features in the dataset. Each of the trees is grown to the largest extent possible, without pruning according to the CART methodology.41,42
From Soup: 42 For the purpose of investigating the characteristic wavenumbers, which were suitable for model construction, we counted the frequency for each of the wavenumbers wherein the intensity was involved in a cross-validation procedure as a feature for model construction ( Fig. 3 ). For the classification of normal vs. low-grade dysplasia, the wavenumbers with the frequency >60 were mainly located in the region ranging from 300 to 600 cm −1 ( Fig. 3A ). For the classification of high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC, the wavenumbers with the frequency >45 were mainly located in the region ranging from 700 to 1100 cm −1 ( Fig. 3B ).

From Soup: 43 In the diagnosis of oral leukoplakia, it is important to grade oral lesions accurately for proper treatment strategy. The near-infrared Raman spectra could reflect the vibrational modes of functional groups of the biomolecules in biological samples, and could be used for the diagnosis of oral diseases. In a previous study, our diagnostic models achieved satisfied results in discriminating the normal mucosa from OLK and OSCC when using all the Raman intensities as features. However, the performance of the diagnostic model in discriminating normal mucosa from the low-grade dysplasia in OLK, as well as the high-grade dysplasia in OLK from OSCC is poor. In the current study, we tried to improve the predictive models using the Raman intensities at the characteristic wavenumbers as features. The prediction results showed that the diagnostic models constructed with intensities at the characteristic wavenumbers performed better compared to those constructed with all the intensities. The accuracies achieved by our improved models were 70.5% and 94.0% ( Table 4 ) for the classification of normal vs. low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC, respectively, which were higher than those achieved by the models constructed using all the intensities (accuracy = 65.4% and 88.0% for the classification of normal vs. low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC, respectively). Our results indicated that it can efficiently improve the performance of the models using the intensities at the characteristic wavenumbers as features.
 ###### 
From cou.: 44 The logistic regression algorithm43 is described as follows:where f(t) is the probability of an event occurring and varies from 0 to 1. In current study, Y is a binary variable representing the positive sample (defined as 1) or the negative sample (defined as 0), t is the linear combination of features, b0 denotes the intercept for model, {b1, …, bn} are the partial regression coefficients, and {x1, …, xn} are the independent spectral features; b0 and a series of regression coefficients can be estimated using the training set.
From Soup: 44 In the subsequent analysis, we counted the frequency for each of the wavenumbers, for which the intensity was selected as a feature to build the models in the LOOCV procedures. The results showed that most of the selected wavenumbers with high frequency (frequency >60) were located in the region ranging from 300 to 600 cm −1 ( Fig. 3A ) when discriminating normal tissue from low-grade dysplasia, while the selected wavenumbers (frequency >45) were mainly located in the region ranging from 700 to 1100 cm −1 ( Fig. 3B ) when discriminating the high-grade dysplasia from OSCC. It can also be observed that the characteristic wavenumbers identified by the variable selection algorithms for the two comparison groups were located in the peaks of the subtracted mean spectra ( Fig. 2 ).
 ###### 
From cou.: 45 A total of 128 spectra were collected from the tissue samples, including 45 Raman spectra from normal mucosa, 33 from low-grade dysplasia, 31 Raman spectra from high-grade dysplasia, and 19 from OSCC. The predictive models were constructed to discriminate the normal mucosa from the low-grade dysplasia tissue (normal vs. low-grade dysplasia) and discriminate the high-grade dysplasia tissue from OSCC (high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC). Fig. 1 shows the Raman spectra of four types of tissues in these two compared groups. The mean spectra of the four types of tissues were calculated and the subtracted mean spectra of the two compared groups are shown in Fig. 2. The main differences in the subtracted spectra between the normal mucosa and the low-grade dysplasia were located in the region ranging from 300 to 600 cm−1 (Fig. 2A), while the differences between the high-grade dysplasia and OSCC were located in the region ranging from 700 to 1100 cm−1 (Fig. 2B).
From Soup: 45 For the classification of normal vs. low-grade dysplasia, the characteristic wavenumbers fell in the region ranging from 300 to 600 cm −1 , which was attributed to the C–C bending vibration within the aliphatic chains. The characteristic wavenumber of 1309 cm −1 corresponded to the CH 3 /CH 2 wagging, twisting or blending mode of lipids, 44 and the characteristic wavenumber of 1452 cm −1 corresponded to CH 2 blending vibration of lipids ( Fig. 2A ). 45 Therefore, it can be inferred that to a certain extent, biomaterial changes in the tissues were usually associated with the content of lipids when normal tissue transformed into low-grade dysplasia, in which the lipid would be less helpful in cell's proliferation. For the classification of high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC, the characteristic wavenumbers fell in the regions ranging from 800 to 990 cm −1 and from 1010 to 1100 cm −1 , which were associated with changes in the collagen content. In addition, the peaks in the region ranging from 1080 to 1100 cm −1 were dominated by the contributions of lipids, nucleic acids, proteins and carbohydrates. 45 The characteristic wavenumbers at 727, 1032, and 1124 cm −1 corresponded to C–C stretching, twisting and bending of collagen. 46–48 The wavenumbers at 727, 731, 746, 766, 1055, 1078, 1080, 1120 and 1336 cm −1 corresponded to Uracil, Cytosine and Thymine ring breathing modes of DNA/RNA, O–P–O backbone symmetric stretching and CH 2 rocking of nucleic acids. 45,46,49 The wavenumbers at 1070, 1078, and 1124 cm −1 were associated with the C–C, C–O skeletal transconformation of acyl backbone in lipid. 44,50,51 The wavenumber at 1082 cm −1 was the characteristic carbohydrate corresponded to C–C stretching of glycogen and the carbohydrates peak for solutions was observed at 1105 cm −1 ( ref. 52 ) ( Table 5 ). It can be inferred that during the malignant transformation from high-grade dysplasia into OSCC, the genetic materials was activated and the corresponding molecular signaling pathways were impacted, which results in changes in the contents of proteins in OSCC. Note that the accuracy of discriminating normal tissues from low-grade dysplasia was lower compared to the classification of high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC. The main reason is that the contents of biomolecules slightly changed when the transformation occurred from the normal tissues to the low-grade dysplasia. In order to further improve the predictive accuracy, more information is needed for the model construction.
 ###### 
From cou.: 46 For the comparisons of normal vs. low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC, the diagnostic models were separately constructed using random forest and logistic regression with all the Raman intensities, and validated by the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method. The prediction results were listed in Table 2. For the classification of normal vs. low-grade dysplasia, the random forest algorithm performed better (accuracy = 65.4%) compared to the logistic regression algorithm (accuracy = 48.7%), while for the classification of high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC, the logistic regression algorithm is better (accuracy = 88.0% and 74.0% for the logistic regression algorithm and the random forest algorithm, respectively). Therefore, in the subsequent analysis, we used the random forest algorithm to discriminate normal mucosa from low-grade dysplasia and used the logistic regression algorithm for the discrimination of high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC.
From Soup: 46 In this study, we developed predictive models for diagnosing various grades of oral leukoplakia by the intensities at the characteristic wavenumbers as features. Our results suggested that it can efficiently improve the performance of predictive models in the classifications of normal vs. low-grade dysplasia, as well as high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC by the intensities at characteristic wavenumbers instead of all the intensities as features. Moreover, the characteristic wavenumbers revealed the potential mechanisms of transformations from normal tissue to low-grade dysplasia and from high-grade dysplasia to OSCC at the molecular level. Our findings can be helpful for understanding the molecular mechanisms of potential malignant transformation of oral leukoplakia.
 ###### 
From cou.: 47 In order to improve the performance of models, two variable selection methods, namely OneR and ReliefF, were involved in our study to evaluate the importance of the features and only the intensities at the characteristic wavenumbers were used to build the models. For each of the comparison groups, both two variable selection methods were applied to identifying the characteristic wavenumbers and the prediction results with the intensities at the characteristic wavenumbers are listed in Table 3. When discriminating the normal mucosa from the low-grade dysplasia, the construction of models with features selected by OneR performed better (accuracy = 82.5%) compared to those with features selected by ReliefF (accuracy = 72.4%). With regard to the classification of high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC, it is better to construct models with features selected by ReliefF (accuracy = 94.7% and 89.3% for ReliefF and OneR, respectively). Consequently, we build the diagnostic model for the classification of normal vs. low-grade dysplasia using a random forest algorithm combined with OneR, while building the model for the classification of high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC using the logistic regression algorithm combined with ReliefF. The models were validated using LOOCV. The prediction results achieved by the diagnostic models are listed in Table 4. Compared with the prediction results achieved by the diagnostic models that were constructed using all the Raman intensities (Table 2), the accuracies achieved by the models constructed with the intensities at the characteristic wavenumbers (70.5% and 94.0% for the classification of normal vs. low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia vs. OSCC, respectively) were higher than those listed in Table 2.
