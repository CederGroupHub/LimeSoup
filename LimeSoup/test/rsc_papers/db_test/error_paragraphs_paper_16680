From cou.: 1 A new method based on a multi-spectral technique was proposed to characterize the signal of colorimetric sensor arrays for gas detection. Firstly, the characteristic wavelengths, which are most relevant to the detected substance, were extracted from the hyperspectral information of the colorimetric sensor arrays. Then, narrowband filters with the corresponding central wavelengths were selected to isolate the effective signal of the sensor arrays. In this study, ammonia (NH3) was taken as an example to test the performance of the proposed multi-spectral method. Prediction of NH3 concentration based on the hyperspectral method and normal tri-color (R/G/B) method was also performed for comparison. Compared with the tri-color method, the correlation coefficient for the testing set (Rt) based on the multi-spectral method increased from 0.902 to 0.976, root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) decreased from 1.213 to 0.548, and residual predictive deviation for the testing set (RPDt) increased from 2.903 to 6.151, which means that the results were notably improved both in accuracy and stability. Furthermore, the multi-spectral method possesses the advantages of low cost, easy operation and greatly reduced data size. The proposed multi-spectral method could be used to characterize the signal of colorimetric sensor arrays for gas detection.

From cou.: 2 The colorimetric sensor array, which mimics the mammalian olfactory or gustatory system, is a novel sensing technique developed in recent years.1–4 The chemically responsive dyes used to fabricate colorimetric sensor arrays usually have open coordination sites for intense coloration and axial ligation. Interactions such as π–π molecular complexation, bond formation, acid–base interaction, physical adsorption and van der Waals interactions can take place when they are exposed to different analytes.5 These interactions change the optical properties of a colorimetric sensor array which then presents different colors or spectra.6 Combined with certain chemometric methods, qualitative or quantitative analysis could be realized utilizing the response signal of all dyes in the array. At present, colorimetric sensor arrays have been widely applied in the detection of various substances, e.g., metal ions,7,8 toxic industrial chemicals,6,9,10 volatile organic compounds,11–14 amines,3 formaldehyde,15 explosives,16 hydrogen sulfide,17etc.

From cou.: 3 Generally, the response signal of the sensor arrays can be characterized through two methods, i.e., the spectroscopic method and the tri-color imaging method, as reported by many authors.2,12,18,19 The spectroscopic method is highly advantageous because its integrated spectra contain a massive amount of information. However, it always needs complex equipment and a certain amount of time to obtain the spectrum from each sensor element, and it is not suitable for sensors with a solid opaque substrate and gas detection. Furthermore, only part of the dye spot could be covered since the focal region of the spectroscopic detector is relatively limited, which means an unavoidable operation error. Compared with the spectroscopic method, the tri-color imaging methods can detect several sensing elements in a given field of view and are easier to operate and need no special instruments,20 which could be a common digital camera, flatbed scanner, cellphone camera, etc. However, the tri-color imaging method usually provides only three or four channels, i.e., red, green and blue (RGB), or sometimes red, yellow, green and blue (RYGB). Thus, the information collected by the tri-color imaging methods is significantly less than that by the spectroscopic method. However, the three detected channels are highly correlated to each other and contain relatively high noise because the response wavelength range of the three kinds of photosensitive units of a camera is wide and overlapping.

From cou.: 4 It is necessary to explore a new method to collect the most useful information from colorimetric sensor arrays, while keeping the advantages of low cost and easy operation. To perform this task, the characteristic wavelengths, which are most relevant to the detected substance, must be extracted from the full wavelength range first, then the signal change of the colorimetric sensor arrays at the characteristic wavelengths should be acquired with a simple device. With this consideration, a multi-spectral method was developed to characterize the signal of the colorimetric sensor arrays based on our former studies.21–25 Firstly, a hyperspectral imaging technique, which could provide both spatial and spectral information simultaneously,26,27 was used to extract the characteristic wavelengths. Then narrowband filters with the corresponding central wavelengths were selected to isolate the effective signal change of the sensor array at the selected wavelengths. Ammonia (NH3) was taken as an example to test the performance of the proposed multi-spectral method. Prediction results based on the multi-spectral information, hyperspectral information and tri-color information were compared.

From cou.: 5 The colorimetric sensor array is composed of a TiO2 porous film substrate and gas sensitive material. Porphyrins and metalloporphyrins are highly conjugated p-type organic semiconductors, and can induce charge transfer between various oxidizing or reducing gases and their delocalized p-systems. This modifies the optical absorbance as well as electrical conductance significantly, and offers the option of developing both chemiresistive as well as optical gas sensors.28,29 pH indicators are a class of chemical detector sensitive to hydronium ions or hydrogen ions in the Arrhenius model. Normally, an indicator can change its color depending on the pH, and they have been widely used in colorimetric sensors.30,31 Thus, we decided to select sensitive materials from these two classes of chemicals. After several of them were screened, nine pH indicators and seven porphyrins/metalloporphyrins (Sigma Chemicals, USA) as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) were selected as the sensitive material. More details about the preparation process of the colorimetric sensor array can be found in previous studies21,32–34 and the ESI.†

From Soup: 62 (8) Since too many variables would reduce the stability of the prediction model, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to decompose the vector into several principal components (PCs), which are uncorrelated and account for the most common spectral variations. 37 The top 3 PCs containing most of the useful information were used to develop a multiple regression model with the arrays in the calibration set. Arrays in the testing set were used to test the regression model.

From Soup: 63 In addition, prediction of NH 3 concentration based on hyperspectral information and tri-color information was also performed for comparison purposes.

From Soup: 64 All image processing and data analysis procedures described above were executed using programs developed in Matlab R2012a (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Extraction of reflectance spectra from the hyperspectral images was finished using ENVI 4.5 (ITT Visual Information Solutions, Boulder, CO, USA). The software for the multi-spectral colorimetric sensor array detection system was programmed with Visual Basic.net.
 ###### 
From cou.: 65 x
From Soup: 65 The hyperspectral imaging system acquired abundant spatial information while collecting spectral information. Fig. 3(a) shows the combined spectral images at three wavelengths located in the red (670 nm), green (525 nm), and blue (460 nm) regions. Hence, it appears similar to its natural color. Representative single-band reflectance images of the sensor arrays at 6 selected wavelengths from 430 to 680 nm are shown in Fig. 3 to demonstrate the general pattern of the hyperspectral images and the differences among different spectral regions. When the wavebands increased, the intensity of the dyes showed different trends because of their different colors. As a result, different difference-images which contained abundant information were acquired at different wavelengths.
 ###### 
From cou.: 66 (7) Three of the 4 difference values, Ix−1, Ix−2, Ix−3, were used to characterize the signal change of dye x according to their optimum wavelength (see Section 3.3). Finally, a 48-dimensional vector (16 dyes × 3 intensity differences) was acquired to characterize the signal change of a colorimetric sensor array.
From Soup: 66 Mean spectra in the range of 430 to 960 nm of each dye were acquired using ENVI 4.5. Then these spectra were pre-processed by MA and SNV sequentially to eliminate variations caused by stochastic noise and baseline drift. The spectrum of a dye before exposure to NH 3 was subtracted from the one after exposure to calculate the difference spectrum as explained in Section 2.3.
 ###### 
From cou.: 67 (8) Since too many variables would reduce the stability of the prediction model, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to decompose the vector into several principal components (PCs), which are uncorrelated and account for the most common spectral variations.37 The top 3 PCs containing most of the useful information were used to develop a multiple regression model with the arrays in the calibration set. Arrays in the testing set were used to test the regression model.
From Soup: 67 Fig. 4(a) shows the typical spectra change of a pH indicator (Methyl orange) exposed to NH 3 of 5 ppm. The spectra before exposure showed relatively strong reflection in the bands at 550–650 nm, which agrees well with its dark orange color. An obvious absorption peak at 770 nm was observed after exposure to NH 3 , and the mechanism may be explained as shown in Fig. 4(b) . 38 NH 3 would ionize to NH 4 + and OH − when combined with H 2 O, then OH − attached to Methyl orange and changed it from an acid form to an alkali form.
 ###### 
From cou.: 68 In addition, prediction of NH3 concentration based on hyperspectral information and tri-color information was also performed for comparison purposes. The difference here is the 48-dimensional vector used to characterize the signal of the colorimetric sensor arrays. For prediction based on the hyperspectral information, the 48-dimensional vector consists of the spectrum difference values at the 48 extracted characteristic wavelengths mentioned in step (4). For prediction based on the tri-color information, the 48-dimensional vector consists of the R/G/B difference values of the 16 dyes.
From Soup: 68 Fig. 4(c) shows the typical spectra change of a metalloporphyrin dye ((5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21 H ,23 H -porphine cobalt( II ), CoP) exposed to NH 3 of 7.5 ppm). The spectra showed relatively strong reflection in the bands 510–540 nm and 650–670 nm, which is consistent with its dark green color. An obvious hypsochromic shift was observed between 680 nm to 960 nm after exposure to NH 3 . The mechanism 39 of this response could be explained as in Fig. 4(d) . An σ-bonding interaction in α-orbitals formed due to the overlap of the NH 3 HOMO with the empty orbital of Co, which leads to an electron density transfer from the NH 3 molecule to the metal center. In addition, π-bonds formed by back donation from the CoP d π and p π orbitals to the π*-antibonding orbitals of NH 3 . In β-orbitals, electrons appear to be redistributed around the porphyrin ring. Such electron density transfer finally converts the saddle-like structure into a coplanar one.

Extraction of reflectance spectra from the hyperspectral images was finished using ENVI 4.5 (ITT Visual Information Solutions, Boulder, CO, USA). The software for the multi-spectral colorimetric sensor array detection system was programmed with Visual Basic.net.
From Soup: 69 Generally, the selected dyes showed good response to NH 3 and different spectrum changes could be observed according to their different molecular structures and reaction mechanisms.
 ###### 
From cou.: 70 The hyperspectral imaging system acquired abundant spatial information while collecting spectral information. Fig. 3(a) shows the combined spectral images at three wavelengths located in the red (670 nm), green (525 nm), and blue (460 nm) regions. Hence, it appears similar to its natural color. Representative single-band reflectance images of the sensor arrays at 6 selected wavelengths from 430 to 680 nm are shown in Fig. 3 to demonstrate the general pattern of the hyperspectral images and the differences among different spectral regions. When the wavebands increased, the intensity of the dyes showed different trends because of their different colors. As a result, different difference-images which contained abundant information were acquired at different wavelengths.
From Soup: 70 In order to select the proper narrowband filters to build the multi-spectral colorimetric sensor array detection system, the characteristic wavelengths should be extracted from the hyperspectral images first. The 3 wavelengths with the local optimum r were selected as the characteristic wavelengths for each dye as described in Section 2.3. Fig. 5 illustrates the correlation coefficient curve of CoP mentioned in Section 3.2 and its 3 selected characteristic wavelengths (dashed lines). The optimum characteristic wavelengths for all 16 dyes are listed in Table S1. †
 ###### 
From cou.: 71 Mean spectra in the range of 430 to 960 nm of each dye were acquired using ENVI 4.5. Then these spectra were pre-processed by MA and SNV sequentially to eliminate variations caused by stochastic noise and baseline drift. The spectrum of a dye before exposure to NH3 was subtracted from the one after exposure to calculate the difference spectrum as explained in Section 2.3.
From Soup: 71 As mentioned in step (5) of the data analysis procedure, Fig. 6 illustrates the distribution of the optimum characteristic wavelengths for the 16 dyes. It was found that the distribution of these wavelengths could be roughly divided into 4 regions. To balance the sensitivity of the involved dyes and ensure the convenience and practicality of the system, the mean value of the characteristic wavelengths located in each region (marked with solid lines) was regarded as the center transmission wavelength of one filter. Thus, 4 narrowband filters in total were used to isolate the effective signal change of the sensor arrays at the selected wavelengths. The center transmission wavelengths of the 4 filters are 540 ± 2 nm (BP540/10K), 610 ± 2 nm (BP619/10K), 808 ± 2 nm (BP808/10K), 935 ± 5 nm (BP935/30K). Furthermore, the bandwidth of the first 3 filters is 10 ± 2 nm, and the last one is 30 ± 5 nm. The filters employed for each dye to characterize its color change are listed in Table S1. † The structure of the developed multi-spectral colorimetric sensor array detection system is shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c) , and explained in Section 2.2.3.
 ###### 
From cou.: 72 Fig. 4(a) shows the typical spectra change of a pH indicator (Methyl orange) exposed to NH3 of 5 ppm. The spectra before exposure showed relatively strong reflection in the bands at 550–650 nm, which agrees well with its dark orange color. An obvious absorption peak at 770 nm was observed after exposure to NH3, and the mechanism may be explained as shown in Fig. 4(b).38 NH3 would ionize to NH4+ and OH− when combined with H2O, then OH− attached to Methyl orange and changed it from an acid form to an alkali form.
From Soup: 72 NH 3 was taken as an example to test the performance of the proposed multi-spectral method. For each array, 4 gray scale images were obtained by changing the selected filters before and after exposure to NH 3 , separately. A digital image processing technique, as explained in Section 2.3, was applied to quantify the signal change of the sensor array at different wavelengths. Then, 4 difference values were acquired for each dye and 3 of them were used to characterize the signal change according to their optimum wavelength (see Table S1 † ). Finally, a 48-dimensional vector (16 dyes × 3 intensity differences) was acquired to characterize the signal change of a colorimetric sensor array.
 ###### 
From cou.: 73 Fig. 4(c) shows the typical spectra change of a metalloporphyrin dye ((5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphine cobalt(II), CoP) exposed to NH3 of 7.5 ppm). The spectra showed relatively strong reflection in the bands 510–540 nm and 650–670 nm, which is consistent with its dark green color. An obvious hypsochromic shift was observed between 680 nm to 960 nm after exposure to NH3. The mechanism39 of this response could be explained as in Fig. 4(d). An σ-bonding interaction in α-orbitals formed due to the overlap of the NH3 HOMO with the empty orbital of Co, which leads to an electron density transfer from the NH3 molecule to the metal center. In addition, π-bonds formed by back donation from the CoP dπ and pπ orbitals to the π*-antibonding orbitals of NH3. In β-orbitals, electrons appear to be redistributed around the porphyrin ring. Such electron density transfer finally converts the saddle-like structure into a coplanar one.
From Soup: 73 PCA was used to extract information from the acquired vector. Fig. S2 † shows the cumulative contributions of the top 10 PCs. It can be seen that the first 3 PCs account for 81.3% of the accumulation contribution rate, which indicates that the top 3 PCs have the potential to explain 81.3% of the signal change of the sensor arrays. Thus, the top 3 PCs were used to establish the multiple regression model for NH 3 concentration prediction. After trying with several models, a three-variable quadratic equation was selected as the regression model. Results are shown in Fig. 7 . Several commonly used parameters, 40,41 i.e. , correlation coefficient ( R c for calibration set, R t for testing set), root mean squared error of cross validation (RMSECV), root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) and residual predictive deviation 42 (RPD c for calibration set, RPD t for test set) were used to evaluate the performance of the developed models. The calibration group could be predicted with R c of 0.976, RMSECV of 0.536 ppm, and RPD c of 6.167, the testing set with R t of 0.977, RMSEP of 0.548 ppm and RPD t of 6.151 respectively. For comparison purposes, prediction of NH 3 concentration based on hyperspectral information and tri-color information was also performed, and the results are shown in Fig. 7 .
 ###### 
From cou.: 74 Generally, the selected dyes showed good response to NH3 and different spectrum changes could be observed according to their different molecular structures and reaction mechanisms.
From Soup: 74 Compared with detection based on the traditional tri-color information, R t based on multi-spectral information increased from 0.902 to 0.976, RMSEP decreased from 1.213 to 0.548, and RPD t increased from 2.903 to 6.151, which means that the results were obviously improved both in accuracy and stability. This is because the multi-spectral detection system could detect the targeted signal change at the optimum wavelengths more effectively and avoid the interference from other useless wavelength regions.

From cou.: 75 In order to select the proper narrowband filters to build the multi-spectral colorimetric sensor array detection system, the characteristic wavelengths should be extracted from the hyperspectral images first. The 3 wavelengths with the local optimum r were selected as the characteristic wavelengths for each dye as described in Section 2.3. Fig. 5 illustrates the correlation coefficient curve of CoP mentioned in Section 3.2 and its 3 selected characteristic wavelengths (dashed lines). The optimum characteristic wavelengths for all 16 dyes are listed in Table S1.†
From Soup: 75 The results also show that measurement based on the multi-spectral information is only slightly less effective than that based on the hyperspectral information, which is caused by the balance of the sensitivity for the involved dyes. However, it is this balance that makes it possible for the multi-spectral method to keep its advantages of low-cost, easy operation and greatly reduced data size. Thus, the proposed multi-spectral method is suitable for the signal characterization of the colorimetric sensor arrays.

From Soup: 76 A multi-spectral method based on selected narrowband filters was proposed to characterize the signal of colorimetric sensor arrays. Firstly, the characteristic wavelengths, which are most relevant to the detected substance, were extracted from the hyperspectral information of the colorimetric sensor arrays. Then narrowband filters with the corresponding central wavelengths were selected to isolate the effective signal change of the sensor array at the selected wavelengths. Based on the multi-spectral method, the calibration set could be predicted with R c of 0.976, RMSECV of 0.536 ppm, and RPD c of 6.167, and the testing set with R t of 0.977, RMSEP of 0.548 ppm and RPD t of 6.151, respectively. The results demonstrate that the multi-spectral method is highly advantageous compared with the tri-color method, both the accuracy and stability were improved. Compared with the hyperspectral method, the multi-spectral method possesses some advantages, such as low-cost, easy operation and greatly reduced data size. Thus, the proposed multi-spectral method could be used to characterize the signal of colorimetric sensor arrays.
