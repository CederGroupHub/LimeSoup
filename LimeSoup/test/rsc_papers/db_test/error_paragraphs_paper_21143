From cou.: 1 Metal catalyzed asymmetric oxidation of prochiral sulfides is one of the prevailing strategies to produce enantiopure sulfoxides. Keeping in view the reported reactivity of peroxo vanadium complexes towards asymmetric oxidation reactions, this study explores the reactivity of vanadia represented as a VO4 cluster with CH3-S-Ph through DFT computations. The mechanism of the oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides with unsupported VO4 is thoroughly investigated. The chiral centre in the VO4 cluster is introduced by grafting it on an SBA-15 support and two conformers of the supported cluster are thus obtained. The study was extended to locate transition states for the reaction of each conformer with CH3-S-Ph. The large enantiomeric excess obtained from the energy difference of the transition states confirms the formation of enantiopure sulfoxide. Analysis of the computational results provides a rational explanation for the observed enantioselectivity, which is remarkable. The optical stability as well as asymmetry of chiral sulfoxides obtained by the current approach has been further confirmed by locating the planar transition state, through which conversion from one enantiomer to another takes place. The calculations suggest that transition between the two enantiomers of sulfoxide is hampered by sufficiently high inversion barriers.

From cou.: 2 The growth in the chemistry of organic sulfoxides during the last decade has been due to their importance as synthetic intermediates for the production of a broad range of chemically and biologically active molecules. The vast chemistry of sulfoxides makes them valuable reagents in organic synthesis.1–3 The high optical stability and symmetry of chiral sulfoxides boosts their applications, and they have been extensively employed as chiral auxiliaries and ligands in a series of organic asymmetric syntheses.1,4 Numerous synthetic approaches using chemical,5–8 microbiological9–11 or enzymatic12–17 methods are reported in the literature to obtain chiral sulfoxides. Chemical methods include two general techniques i.e. nucleophilic substitution of optically active sulfur derivatives5,18 and asymmetric oxidation of prochiral sulfides, i.e. chiral sulfoxidation.19 The prevailing approach for the preparation of enantiopure sulfoxide is metal catalyzed asymmetric oxidation of sulfides. Kagan20 and Modena21 introduced titanium complexes into this reaction system. Later, metallo-schiff base complexes, with a variety of metal centers like vanadium, manganese, or iron, with a range of ligands such as diols, triols, Schiff bases and double Schiff bases, amino acids and amino alcohols were also employed.22–25 Among other transition metals, a vanadium based catalyst obtained by the combination of Schiff bases derived from chiral amino alcohols and [VO(acac)2], using aqueous hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant reported by Bolm and Bienewald has been widely studied.26 Biologically, chiral sulfoxidations are carried out by enzymes in plants or microorganisms, particularly by peroxidases. Among them, vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases (VHPO) are an important class of enzymes that possess this function.27 Vanadium based systems have been developed as models for VHPO for instance vanadium-Schiff bases, vanadium-amino acids, and vanadium-amino alcohols.28–30 Various computational studies on oxidation catalyzed by vanadium complexes considering biomimetic models of haloperoxidases are available in the literature.31–33

From cou.: 4 In this work, we present a computational study performed within the formalism of density functional theory (DFT) on the origin of enantioselectivity in the oxidation of prochiral sulfide (CH3-S-Ph) to sulfoxide using a VO4 cluster grafted on a SBA-15 support. The heterogenization of the cluster on the support offers a novel approach towards the synthesis of enantiopure sulfoxide as it generates a stereocentre in the metal oxide cluster. A chiral catalyst is known to promote the preferential reactivity of one of the enantioselective pathways that selectively leads to the formation of the product at the end of the reaction.48,49 Instead of employing an unrealistic simplified model, the reactivity of both the experimentally viable conformers of the supported cluster with CH3-S-Ph is investigated using the QM/MM approach to decipher the mechanism of asymmetric synthesis of sulfoxide. The detailed analysis of electronic and steric effects offers conclusive evidence of high enantioselectivity in the reaction.

From cou.: 5 All calculations reported in the study have been performed by employing the hybrid B3LYP exchange correlation functional50 in combination with the all electron polarized triple ζ valence basis set (TZVP) augmented by a set of polarization functions (a p-set for vanadium, a d-set for oxygen)51 for quantum mechanical (QM) calculations. The accuracy and reliability of the employed level of theory has already been established in our previous work that reports direct hydroxylation of benzene with the aid of a V4O10 cluster.52 All gas phase geometries and transition states were optimized using the B3LYP functional with empirical dispersion added to it (B3LYP-D3).53 This functional contains both exact exchange and dispersion corrections that play important roles in correctly describing weak interactions.

From cou.: 6 The SBA-15 support has been optimized by QM calculations without any symmetry constraints. Fig. 1(a) shows the optimized geometry of the SBA-15 model used for calculations. In order to graft the metal complex on the SBA-15 support, the VO4 moiety was placed near the edges and in the centre of SBA-15. The computations on SBA-15 supported VO4 have been performed using a QM/MM scheme with the help of ONIOM. It is a hybrid method that enables different ab initio or semi-empirical methods to be applied to different parts of a molecule/system and has been shown to be a very effective method in heterogeneous catalysis.60–62 Since, the metal cluster is now grafted on an SBA-15 support, the reaction system has been divided into two parts; the bulky SBA-15 part was treated according to MM, while the chemically important region, i.e. the CH3-S-Ph and VO4 embedded SBA-15 site, was subjected to QM calculations (Fig. 1(b)) (the QM level of theory was the same as that applied to the reaction in the gas phase). Full QM calculations have also been performed to obtain the single point energy (SPE) of the SBA-15 supported cluster using the B3LYP-D3 functional.

From cou.: 7 To explore the reactivity of a VO4 moiety towards methyl phenyl sulfide, the structures of both the reactants (VO4 moiety and CH3-S-Ph) were optimized; the VO4 moiety contains two oxo oxygens (O2−) (labeled as O1 and O2) bonded to vanadium and a peroxide linkage (O22−) (labeled as O3 and O4) as shown in Fig. 2(a). The optimized structure of VO4 corresponds to the formula V(O)2(O2) and it is a peroxo complex. The peroxo structure of VO4 is reported in the literature by Jakubikove et al.39 and Sauer and Vyboishchikov.38 Formally, VO4 can be formed from V6+, two O2− and one O22− with V6+ being an open shell species with 5 electrons in valence p orbitals ([Ne] 3s2 3p5). The VO4 belongs to an open shell system (with one unpaired electron) with ground state spin multiplicity as a doublet. The C–H and C–S bond lengths in the optimized structure of methyl phenyl sulfide are 1.09 Å and 1.80 Å respectively (Fig. 2(b)).

From cou.: 8 The VO4 moiety has a high electron affinity of 81.71 kcal mol−1 (the adiabatic electron affinity of VO4 was calculated by taking the energy difference between the optimized geometry of neutral and anionic cluster). In methyl phenyl sulfide, there are lone pairs of electrons centered on a sulfur atom (Fig. 3(a)), its reaction with VO4 is likely to proceed by electrophilic attack of VO4 on sulfide with the donation of the lone electron pair of sulfide to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of VO4. As VO4 is an open shell system, its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is singly filled. The incoming electron from sulfide can either enter into the half filled HOMO, resulting into a singlet spin state (1VO4−) or the LUMO which will result in a triplet spin state (3VO4−). The incoming electron density is most likely to be accommodated in the half filled HOMO of VO4 as 1VO4− is more stable than 3VO4− by 21.38 kcal mol−1. As discussed above, the VO4 moiety has two types of linkages, oxo and peroxo; it is to be noted that the HOMO of VO4 is centered on the peroxo oxygen atoms (Fig. 3(b)), and the electron transfer from sulfide to VO4 weakens the peroxo linkage as the HOMO of VO4− is mainly the πg* orbital of the peroxo ligand (which is an antibonding orbital, Fig. 3(a)). This has also been confirmed by density functional calculations of Vyboishchikov and Sauer38 and Jia et al.63 Accordingly, out of the two possible sites i.e. (Operoxo and Ooxo), the weaker peroxo site of the VO4 moiety was found to be the sensitive site for the reaction.

From cou.: 9 Like trigonal carbon compounds, two ‘‘faces’’ or ‘‘sides’’ can be defined for a sulfide molecular plane; preferential reagent attack at one face generates stereoselectivity. The two faces are “enantiotopic” and attack at each face leads to enantiomers. Fig. 4 shows the two possible enantiotopic facial approaches of the electrophile (VO4) to the sulfide plane that lead to different enantiomeric products. The reaction is initiated by placing one of the enantiotopic faces of CH3-S-Ph in the vicinity of Operoxo(O4) of the VO4 moiety and coordinate drive calculations were carried out against the dihedral angle (V–O4peroxo–S–Ph) as a reaction coordinate for both the enantiotopic faces (Fig. 5). The scan was performed for 180° rotation with increment of 4° to scan all the possible orientations. The relaxed scans allowed for readjustment of the geometries of the reacting molecules at each step and helped us to guess the TS geometry. The two alternate options for an electrophile (VO4) to approach the sulfide plane (Fig. 4) lead to two different TSs (RTS and STS). The geometry corresponding to maxima in both the scans (Fig. 5) was subjected to optimization according to the Berny algorithm, and each one corresponded to one imaginary frequency of 35.05i cm−1 and 21.22i cm−1 respectively. The free energy profiles for both pathways (a and b in Fig. 4) at 298 K and 1 atm pressure for the reaction of VO4 are depicted in Fig. 6. It is to be noted that the reaction between VO4 and CH3-S-Ph involves a barrierless TS with respect to the reactants (R), which are infinitely separated. One of the oxygens (O4) of the peroxo linkage of VO4 forms a linkage with a sulfur atom, while the other (O3) binds strongly with vanadium to form a VO3 unit39 (geometries of stationary points with structural parameters are given in Fig. 6). The complex formed [VO3–O–S(CH3)(Ph)] has been stabilized with the release of energy. The occurrence of a barrierless TS indicates the vigorous reactivity of VO4 towards CH3-S-Ph at low/room temperature. It is interesting to note that a chiral centre has been generated at the sulfur atom; all four groups (methyl, phenyl, oxygen and a lone pair of electrons) attached to the sulfur are different but the reaction is not likely to be enantioselective as neither the reactants nor the catalyst is chiral. The inclusion of dispersion correction lowers the energy of all the stationary points. (Fig. 6(b)).

From cou.: 10 The preferential formation of either the R or S sulfoxide is decided by the energy difference between their corresponding TSs. Though the two TSs have higher energy difference after optimization with dispersion correction, it is to be noted that in a gas phase reaction, the product formed at the end is a complex of VO4 and CH3-S-Ph. However, the reaction is facile and shows the promise of enantioselectivity as the addition of oxygen to the prochiral sulfide has generated a chiral centre at the sulfur atom.

From cou.: 11 It is a known fact that enantioselectivity in organic synthesis is difficult to achieve as enantiomers possess identical enthalpies and entropies, and hence are produced in equal amounts by an undirected process – leading to a racemic mixture. The solution is to introduce a chiral feature which will promote the formation of one enantiomer over another via interactions at the transition state. This is known as asymmetric induction and can involve chiral features in the substrate, reagent, catalyst or environment.64 This works by lowering the activation energy required to form one enantiomer compared to that of the opposing enantiomer.65 In the present study, methyl phenyl sulfoxide produced as a result of the reaction between CH3-S-Ph and VO4 has a chiral centre but the stereoselectivity of the obtained product is low as none of the reactants has a chiral centre. The stereoselectivity in this reaction can be attained by introducing chirality in either the CH3-S-Ph or VO4 moiety. While no change was possible in the reactant CH3-S-Ph, we thought of modifying the structure of the VO4 moiety. In this context, it is pertinent to mention here that in the computational study reported by Balcells and coworkers66 enantioselectivity has been achieved by generating a chiral centre at vanadium such that two diastereomeric forms of the catalyst (V(O)(L)(OOH) where L = bulky tridentate Schiff base) could exist. It has been shown that each of these diastereomeric forms of the catalyst can further result in either the R or S enantiomer of the sulfoxide product. Motivated by the above approach and high reactivity of VO4 towards CH3-S-Ph, it was worthwhile to modify the structure of the VO4 moiety. While in the reported study,66 chirality in the vanadium complex has been introduced by changing the ligand, the present approach is to adsorb the VO4 on a substrate to generate a chiral centre. The current approach is novel and has direct experimental relevance as in contrast to the gas phase computational studies reported in the literature, the experimental studies are feasible only either in solvent or on a solid support.5–7,19

From cou.: 12 It is well documented that a local environment inside the mesopores of the support affects the enantioselectivity of the reaction.67–69 Therefore, it is prudent to graft the metal complex on a suitable solid support. Ordered mesoporous solids like MCM-41 and SBA-15, are potential materials for heterogenization of a valuable homogeneous catalyst. It is to be emphasized that enhanced catalytic activity of a transition metal on the mesoporous support has been established by various experimental studies.45,46,70 Recently a new system has been designed that uses hydrogen peroxide at room temperature in the presence of zirconium oxide complex-functionalized mesoporous MCM-41 (Zr-oxide@MCM-41) as a catalyst for the oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides as well as for oxidative coupling of thiols into their corresponding disulfides.46 Bearing this in mind, we optimized the SBA-15 silica support (Fig. 7). In order to graft the metal complex on the SBA-15 support, the VO4 moiety was placed both near the edges (site (A) Fig. 7) and in the centre of SBA-15 (site (B) in Fig. 7). The VO4 moiety gets adsorbed at the centre of SBA-15 with the liberation of 57 kcal mol−1 of energy but the adsorption energy (Eadsorption = ESBA-15-VO4 − (ESBA-15 + EVO4)) was found to be positive for adsorption at the edge of the SBA-15 surface. The adsorption energy has also been calculated from the full QM calculations using dispersion correction, and the SPE of the ONIOM optimized geometries of VO4 grafted at the centre of SBA-15 was found to be 68.34 kcal mol−1. The lowering of the adsorption energy after taking into consideration the dispersion correction suggests that long range forces are important for the interactions between VO4 and the SBA-15 support.

From cou.: 13 The stable VO4 moiety embedded in the centre of the SBA-15 support was selected to carry out sulfoxidation of CH3-S-Ph. Structure analysis of VO4-SBA-15 shows that chirality has been successfully introduced at the vanadium centre. Vanadium is coordinated with four oxygens with different environments (Fig. 8). Two enantiomers (R and S) of VO4-SBA-15 labelled as RVO4-SBA-15 and SVO4-SBA-15 have been optimized using an ONIOM approach. Fig. 8 shows the geometries of two enantiomers of VO4-SBA-15; one with vanadium in an S configuration (SVO4-SBA-15 Fig. 8(a)) and another with vanadium in an R configuration (RVO4-SBA-15 Fig. 8(b)). The reactions of both enantiomers with CH3-S-Ph were studied separately.

From cou.: 14 The chirality of the vanadium atom in the stereoselective catalyst and two enantiotopic faces of sulfide will influence the stability of TSs which further controls the selectivity of the product. The reaction of the SBA-15 embedded chiral RVO4 moiety with two enantiotopic faces of sulfide (Fig. 4) leads to two TSs; the corresponding energy profile is depicted in Fig. 9. DFT optimized geometries of en route TSs are shown in Fig. 10. Both the TSs (RTS and STS) had one imaginary frequency of 711i cm−1 and 748i cm−1 respectively. Their connectivity to the corresponding reactants and products has been confirmed by IRC calculations. The transfer of electron density from sulfide to the VO4 moiety is evident from the increase of nearly 0.65e partial positive charge on the sulfur atom and increase of partial negative charge on oxygen atoms of the VO4 moiety (Table 1). The transfer of electron density from the sulfur atom of sulfide to periodates has also been observed in the study of Ruff et al.71 The MEP plots of both the TSs (Fig. 11) provide concrete evidence of the shift of electron density from sulfide to the VO4 moiety. It is noticeable that in the case of RTS, the transfer of electron density is more (Fig. 11a) than in the case of STS wherein the electron density is delocalized between both the reactants (Fig. 11b). Enantioselectivity has been traditionally quantified by evaluating the enantiomeric excess according to the equations below:60

From Soup: 24 In the gas phase, the sulfoxidation of CH 3 -S-Ph by VO 4 was found to be a barrierless process while with SBA-15 supported VO 4 the reaction proceeds through a barrier of 50.56 kcal mol −1 . This may be attributed to the increase in coordination of VO 4 when supported on the SBA-15 that imparts it extra stability. The increase in activation barrier for the supported cluster vis-à-vis the unsupported moiety is reported in the literature. 72,73

From Soup: 25 Both the TSs led to the respective R and S products with sp 3 centre chirality at sulfur with one lone pair of electrons (Fig. S1 in the ESI † ).

From Soup: 26 To persuade a chiral catalyst to transfer the chiral information stored in its structure to the reactant via interaction at the transition state, both steric and electronic effects play a significant role, and it is well accepted that nature uses both these effects to promote chiral recognition. 74–79 Rationalization of the origin of the differential stabilization in stereo controlling the TSs is carried out by using activation strain analysis. The contribution of strain and interaction energy in the activation energy has been computed. 80 In an activation strain model, activation energies Δ E a are decomposed into the activation strain Δ E strain of the reactants and the interaction energy Δ E int between the reactants in the activated complex: Δ E a = Δ E strain + Δ E int . The activation strain Δ E strain depends on the strength of the activated bond and on the extent to which a particular metal–oxygen bond expands in the activated complex. The interaction energy Δ E int is directly determined by the bonding capabilities of the reactants. 81 In this case the destabilizing strain energy of both the R and S TSs is the same (64.55 kcal mol −1 ) whereas the stabilizing interaction energy of R TS (−35.25 kcal mol −1 ) is higher than that of S TS (−16.19 kcal mol −1 ) ( Table 2 ). This suggests that the energy difference between the R and S TSs that leads to enantioselectivity is owing to more favorable interactions between the reacting species in the R orientation than in the S orientation.

From Soup: 27 Careful analysis of the structure of both TSs ( Fig. 10 ) shows that orientation of the phenyl ring with respect to the SBA-15 support is markedly different in R TS and S TS, and the orientation of the phenyl ring in R TS ( Fig. 10(a) ) facilitates its π-interaction with SBA-15. In order to probe the role of π-interaction between the phenyl ring and SBA-15, we investigated a similar reaction by replacing an aryl group with ethyl (CH 3 -S-C 2 H 5 ). Interestingly, the free energy profile for the reaction of CH 3 -S-C 2 H 5 with VO 4 -SBA-15 ( Fig. 12 ) indicates that the enantiomeric excess is only 62% corresponding to an energy difference of 0.86 kcal mol −1 between R TS and S TS. This leads us to important conclusions that while an SBA-15 embedded VO 4 moiety introduces enantioselectivity to the sulfoxide, the role of substituent groups attached to the sulfur atom in the sulfide is crucial for obtaining large enantiomeric excess. This is in agreement with the experimental report of Kagan and Rebiere. 82

From Soup: 28 It was observed that both the R and S enantiomers of SBA-15 embedded VO 4 had nearly the same energy. While, as discussed above the R enantiomer led to large enantiomeric excess, we further investigated the reaction of the S isomer ( S VO 4 -SBA-15) with sulfide. As in the previous case, the reaction was carried out with both the enantiotopic faces of sulfide ( Fig. 4 ) and the corresponding TSs are ( R TS and S TS) shown in Fig. 13 . The energy profile indicates high enantiomeric excess (100% according to eqn (4) ) for the energy difference of 9.18 kcal mol −1 between the two TSs (see Fig. S2 for optimized geometries of the TSs, ESI † ). The reaction was selective towards the S enantiomer of sulfoxide, which lies lower in energy, wherein, the phenyl ring is oriented towards SBA-15 (Fig. S2 in the ESI † ). The activation strain analysis ( Table 2 ), NBO analysis (Table S1 in the ESI † ) and MEP surfaces (Fig. S3 in the ESI † ) are suggestive of a larger shift in electron density in the case of S TS. The orientation of the phenyl ring in more stabilized TSs suggests that the combination of electronic and steric effects provides enantioselectivity to the reaction. The electronic interactions in the transition state are mainly characterized by donation of electron density from the sulfur atom of sulfide to the vanadium-peroxo fragment. The sulfide acts as a nucleophile in this oxidation reaction, which agrees with the experimental observation that sulfide is the nucleophile in an oxidation reaction with vanadium-peroxo complexes. 83

From Soup: 29 It is to be noted that in the case of sp 3 centered chirality, when the stereocentre has a lone pair of electrons, both enantiomers can interconvert through a process called pyramidal inversion in which a mirror image is formed through a trigonal planar TS. 84 We obtained the trigonal planar TS ( Fig. 14 ) in the pathway of inter-conversion of two enantiomers, R and S of methyl phenyl sulfoxide that was confirmed by IRC calculations. It has been well documented in the literature that the inversion barrier of 29 kcal mol −1 observed in the present case is sufficiently high for preferential synthesis of one enantiomer. 85
