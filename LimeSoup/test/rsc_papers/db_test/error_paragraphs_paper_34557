From cou.: 1 We present a Gibbs random field model for the microscopic interactions in a viscoplastic fluid. The model has only two parameters which are sufficient to describe the internal energy of the material in the absence of external stress and a third parameter for a constant externally applied stress. The energy function is derived from the Gibbs potential in terms of the external stress and internal energy. The resulting Gibbs distribution, over a configuration space of microscopic interactions, can mimic experimentally observed macroscopic behavioural phenomena that depend on the externally applied stress. A simulation algorithm that can be used to approximate samples from the Gibbs distribution is given and it is used to gain several insights about the model. Corresponding to weak interactions between the microscopic solid units, our model reveals a smooth solid–fluid transition which is fully reversible upon increasing/decreasing external stresses. If the interaction between neighbouring microscopic constituents exceeds a critical threshold the solid–fluid transition becomes abrupt and a hysteresis of the deformation states is observed even at the asymptotic limit of steady forcing. Quite remarkably, in spite of the limited number of parameters involved, the predictions of our model are in a good qualitative agreement with macro rheological experimental results on the solid–fluid transition in various yield stress materials subjected to an external stress.

From cou.: 2 Yield stress materials or viscoplastic fluids are ubiquitous in nature and they are encountered daily in a variety of forms: foods (mayonnaise, molten chocolate, mustard, ketchup), cosmetic products (shaving foam, tooth paste, hair gel, shampoos, hand and face creams), drilling muds, cements, volcanic lava, molten metals, suspensions of microalgae etc. A particular class of yield stress materials is the physical gel. Due to their large water content, the physical gels are compatible with biological tissues which makes them excellent candidates for various biomedical applications: targeted drug delivery,1,2 contact lenses, noninvasive intervertebral disc repair3 and tissue engineering.4

From cou.: 4 It is widely believed that the macroscopic yield stress behaviour originates from the presence of a microstructure which can sustain a finite local stress prior to breaking apart and allowing for a macroscopic flow to set in.

 ###### 
From cou.: 5 To illustrate this, we present in Fig. 1 micrographs (acquired in a quiescent state) of several materials that exhibit a yield stress behaviour. In spite of clear differences in the chemical nature (and, consequently, physico-chemical properties) of these materials, heterogeneous and soft-solid like aggregates are visible in each of the micrographs presented in Fig. 1. A microscopic experimental study of the yielding would require monitoring in real time both the motion of such aggregates and the dynamics of their break-up (and, possibly, reforming) during flow. This experimental approach is difficult to implement and we are aware of only one previous work that describes the evolution of the microstructure during yielding.6

From cou.: 6 The solid–fluid transition may be investigated during macroscopic rheological experiments by subjecting the material to a controlled stress ramp and monitoring its response (the rate of shear ). Prior to yielding negligibly small shear rates are measured whereas above the yield point non-zero values are recorded which allows one to “guess” the yield point.

From cou.: 9 The macroscopic yielding behaviour observed during experiments similar to the ones illustrated in Fig. 2 is often modelled by the Herschel–Bulkley law,7,8σ = σy + KN. Here is the rate of shear, i.e., the rate at which the material is being deformed, σ is the externally applied stress to cause this deformation, K is a so-called consistency parameter that sets the viscosity scale in the flowing state and N is the power law index which characterizes the degree of shear thinning of the viscosity beyond the yield point. In the particular case of a Newtonian behaviour beyond the yield point with N = 1, this model reduces to the Bingham model.9

From cou.: 10 In spite of its wide use by rheologists, fluid dynamicists, applied mathematicians and engineers, the Herschel–Bulkley model (and its regularized variants, e.g. Papanastasiou10) is in fact applicable only for a limited number of yield stress materials, sufficiently far from the solid–fluid transition, i.e. when σ > σy, and in the conditions of a steady state forcing, i.e. when a constant external stress σ is applied over a very long period of time (t0 → ∞). For each material investigated in Fig. 2 a departure from the Herschel–Bulkley yielding scenario is clearly visible within the transitional regime (the highlighted parts in each panel) – see the full lines. The data presented in Fig. 2 indicate that the solid–fluid transition is gradual: the material does not yield at a given value σy of the applied stress but within a finite interval of stresses (see the highlighted regions in Fig. 2).

From cou.: 11 Thixotropy, which may be loosely understood as a time dependence of the microstructure (and, implicitly, of the macroscopic rheological parameters) results from a competition between destruction and rejuvenation of the soft material units subjected to stress and is a major reason for the departure from this simple yielding scenario.11 During controlled stress ramps performed for both increasing and decreasing stresses the thixotropy manifests through the emergence of a rheological hysteresis which is consistent with an irreversibility of the deformation states. This effect is visible in each of the panels (a–c) of Fig. 2 but its magnitude is clearly related to the specific microstructure of each material.

 ###### 
From cou.: 13 For the case of mayonnaise and mustard (the circles and the squares in Fig. 3), a non monotone dependence of the magnitude of the hysteresis on the characteristic forcing time t0 is observed. Corresponding to low values of t0 (fast forcing) the hysteresis area first increases and then, for large values of t0 (slow forcing), decreases following a power law. This non monotone behaviour agrees well with the measurements Divoux and his coworkers performed for several yield stress materials: mayonnaise, LAPONITE® gel and carbon black gel.12 As pointed out in ref. 12, these non monotone dependencies may be fitted by a log normal function (the dashed lines in Fig. 3). The presence of a local maximum of these curves has been attributed to the existence of a critical time scale t0* specific to each material which describes the restructuration dynamics of the solid material units. Thus, it was suggested that this non monotone behaviour is universal and can be observed for any pasty material.

From cou.: 14 It has been shown recently that a clear departure from the Herschel–Bulkley behaviour can be observed even for “simple” yield stress fluids such as the Carbopol gels particularly during unsteady flows taking place around the yield point.12–15 The yielding behaviour of a Carbopol gel is illustrated here in panel (c) of Fig. 2. As compared to the mayonnaise and the mustard, no local maximum was observed in the dependence of the hysteresis area on the characteristic forcing time. It is suggested in ref. 12 that in the case of a Carbopol gel the maximum may occur at values of t0 which are too small to probe during rheologic tests. A negative power law scaling is observed for large t0 which indicates that in the limit of very slow forcing the Carbopol gels behave as non-thixotropic yield stress fluids.

From cou.: 15 To overcome the difficulties in capturing the underlying physics of yielding via rheological tests, several phenomenological macroscopic models have been proposed.13,16–22 The common feature of these models is the quantity ā(t), the volume fraction of the unyielded material at time t whose time evolution is directly related to the applied stress via an evolution equation in the form . Thus, as the applied stress is increased, ā(t) varies smoothly from 1 to 0 and the combined solid and fluid rheological responses are weighted accordingly into a constitutive relation.

From cou.: 16 As opposed to the Bingham and the Herschel–Bulkley models which predict an abrupt solid–fluid transition when ā jumps from 1 to 0 (this can be indirectly inferred from Fig. 2 by monitoring the full lines) at a well defined value of the applied stress, say, σ = σy, such approaches which directly account for the evolution of ā(t) are able to describe several features observed in macroscopic experiments (which we have partially illustrated in Fig. 2), such as:

From cou.: 20 Though able to model sufficiently complex rheological data (ranging from controlled stress/strain unsteady flow ramps, creep tests and oscillatory tests in a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes), such phenomenological macroscopic models do have a number of limitations. First, they typically involve a rather large number of parameters which are not directly and easily measurable and can be obtained only by fitting the experimental data. Second, such models are not inherently validated from a thermodynamical standpoint—the second law of thermodynamics is not guaranteed to be held—and such a validation is not always straightforward as it requires the derivation of a thermodynamic potential.23,24 Third, although able to describe rheological data similar to those presented in Fig. 2, such models are unable to provide insights into the microscopic scale dynamics of the solid–fluid transition because they solely describe a macroscopic volume fraction ā(t) but not the evolution of the microscopic solid–fluid interfaces.

From cou.: 21 Because the macroscopic yield stress behaviour exemplified in Fig. 2 originates from the presence of a “soft” microstructure, an alternative way of assessing the dynamics of the yielding process is to focus on the evolution of the micro-structural soft material units (or aggregates) as the external stress is gradually increased past the solid–fluid transition and thereby assess the macroscopic scale behaviour from the perspective of statistical mechanics.

From cou.: 23 A thermodynamic approach for the deformation of a physical gel has been recently proposed by An and coworkers.25 By using a mean field approach, they construct a free energy functional and describe the microscopic scale dynamics of the gel network as a function of the applied stress in terms of the monomer volume fraction and an internal connectivity tensor characterizing the gel network. As the free energy functional they propose accounts for the elastic energy, the mixing energy and the bond energy, the approach of An and coworkers is quite general and is expected to be applicable to a broad class of physical gels and chemical gels with a fixed number of monomers per cross-link.

From cou.: 24 de Bruyn has modelled the restricted diffusion of small tracer particles in heterogeneous media by performing Monte Carlo simulations in an uncorrelated site-percolation model.26 His simulations reveal a transition from a viscous to an elastic behaviour at a site-filling probability that is different from that corresponding to the percolation transition. He explains this finding by the confinement of the tracers in the spatially heterogeneous medium which makes the general Stokes–Einstein relation inapplicable in this case. A partial agreement between the results of the simulation and experimental results is found.27,28

From cou.: 25 We propose in the following a microscopic model for the yielding or gelation, corresponding to ā approaching 0 or 1 respectively, of a physical gel using an essentially bi-parametric family of a correlated site percolation model37 that extends the uncorrelated version26 towards a correlated version33 but with an emphasis on the effects of externally applied and time-varying stress ramps. Our model builds on the analogy between the local agglomerative interactions in terms of assembly/disassembly of neighbouring gel particles in a microscopic gel network—see ref. 31 (2.5,2.6,5.9,5.9.1,5.9.1.1,8.1.4) and ref. 32 for standardized nomenclature—subjected to an external stress field.

From cou.: 27 Our thermodynamically consistent microscopic model with only two parameters that reflect the rheological properties of the gel and only two energy-determining configuration statistics—the number of gelled particles and the number of gelled pairs of neighboring particles—is able to capture the macroscopic behaviours of yielding and gelation for any stress regime given as a function of time, including hysteretic effects, if any. Our approach is fundamentally probabilistic and formalizes Gibbs fields as time-homogeneous and time-inhomogeneous Markov chains over the state space of all microscopic configurations.

 ###### 
From cou.: 227 (2) , the first largest connected component
From Soup: 227 In the absence of any external stress, we are interested in the macroscopic behaviour of phase transition from an initial fluid configuration, typically with x (0) = 0 , to the configuration of a physical gel with a percolation cluster. Recall that a percolation cluster (see Appendix B.1) appears when the largest connected component of the configuration x given by spans the entire lattice as indicated by . This process is known as aging and can be thought of as the process of letting the material rest after having agitated it to a fully fluid state.
 ###### 
From cou.: 228 (3) , the size of the first largest connected component per site
From Soup: 228 Let the initial site configuration be all fluid with x (0) = 0 and ( ā ( x (0)), ( x (0))) = (0,0). We model aging by the time evolution of the site configuration, i.e. by x ( m ) as m → ∞, or equivalently in rescaled time by x ( t ) as t → ∞, where m = [ tn 2 ]. The material as it ages may or may not form a gel depending on the parameters α and β . For various values of α and β we obtain insights from Monte Carlo simulations of stress-free gelation, i.e. , for the fluid–solid (F–S) phase transition to occur in the absence of external stress.
 ###### 
From cou.: 229 (4) , the fraction of the rows of n that are permeated (from top to bottom) by .
From Soup: 229 Site percolation model of Section B.1 with site-filling probability p , which gives the probability of a site being in phase 1, has been used (see ref. 26, 33 and references therein) to model gelation over time. In these studies percolation transition as p varies is used to model gel transition. In our approach we treat α , the site-specific threshold, and β , the interaction constant, as fixed rheological parameters that characterize the nature of the given yield stress material. Recall that α and β specify the Gibbs potential over the two types of cliques in order to give the energy of a site configuration under a given external stress σ (as derived in Section 2). When we study the possible gelation of a material with a given α and β we do not think of varying the site-filling probability directly, as in ref. 26 , but rather let it be defined by α and β in a possibly configuration-dependent manner. Thus, if we find that gelation occurs for a specific value of ( α , β ), say (8,1), then we interpret this as the gelation of the material with ( α , β ) = (8,1) in the absence of external stress, i.e. the material evolves probabilistically on the configuration space from the completely fluid configuration of 0 to one with a percolation cluster. Thus our approach to modeling gelation is not only microscopic but also mechanistic, in terms of allowing the nature of stochastic evolution in the configuration space to depend on the fixed rheological parameters α and β .
 ###### 
From cou.: 230 In this Section we mainly obtain various insights about the macroscopic behaviour of our model based on Monte Carlo simulations from Algorithms 1 and 2 and make some comparisons with both existing theoretical results and the qualitative yielding behaviour observed in macroscopic experiments. The analysis will be carried on as a function of the applied stress σ, site specific threshold α and the interaction parameter β.
From Soup: 230 Recall that our non-interactive model with β = 0, in the absence of any external stress ( σ = 0), is the site percolation model with site-filling probability p = (1 + e − α ) −1 . When β = 0 and p = (1 + e − α ) −1 ≥ p c ≊ 0.5927, the critical site percolation probability, we have a large percolation cluster of gelled sites that permeates through out the material and turns the material into a gel. If (1 + e − α ) −1 < p c then the material, as it ages, will not form a percolation cluster and therefore remain as a fluid. The critical value p c of the site-filling probability p can be transformed into a critical value α c of the rheological parameter α , in the absence of interaction ( β = 0) and external stress ( σ = 0) as follows:

From cou.: 231 In the absence of any external stress, we are interested in the macroscopic behaviour of phase transition from an initial fluid configuration, typically with x(0) = 0, to the configuration of a physical gel with a percolation cluster. Recall that a percolation cluster (see Appendix B.1) appears when the largest connected component of the configuration x given by spans the entire lattice as indicated by . This process is known as aging and can be thought of as the process of letting the material rest after having agitated it to a fully fluid state.

 ###### 
From cou.: 232 Let the initial site configuration be all fluid with x(0) = 0 and (ā(x(0)),(x(0))) = (0,0). We model aging by the time evolution of the site configuration, i.e. by x(m) as m → ∞, or equivalently in rescaled time by x(t) as t → ∞, where m = [tn2]. The material as it ages may or may not form a gel depending on the parameters α and β. For various values of α and β we obtain insights from Monte Carlo simulations of stress-free gelation, i.e., for the fluid–solid (F–S) phase transition to occur in the absence of external stress.

 ###### 
From cou.: 233 Site percolation model of Section B.1 with site-filling probability p, which gives the probability of a site being in phase 1, has been used (see ref. 26, 33 and references therein) to model gelation over time. In these studies percolation transition as p varies is used to model gel transition. In our approach we treat α, the site-specific threshold, and β, the interaction constant, as fixed rheological parameters that characterize the nature of the given yield stress material. Recall that α and β specify the Gibbs potential over the two types of cliques in order to give the energy of a site configuration under a given external stress σ (as derived in Section 2). When we study the possible gelation of a material with a given α and β we do not think of varying the site-filling probability directly, as in ref. 26, but rather let it be defined by α and β in a possibly configuration-dependent manner. Thus, if we find that gelation occurs for a specific value of (α,β), say (8,1), then we interpret this as the gelation of the material with (α,β) = (8,1) in the absence of external stress, i.e. the material evolves probabilistically on the configuration space from the completely fluid configuration of 0 to one with a percolation cluster. Thus our approach to modeling gelation is not only microscopic but also mechanistic, in terms of allowing the nature of stochastic evolution in the configuration space to depend on the fixed rheological parameters α and β.

 ###### 
From cou.: 234 Recall that our non-interactive model with β = 0, in the absence of any external stress (σ = 0), is the site percolation model with site-filling probability p = (1 + e−α)−1. When β = 0 and p = (1 + e−α)−1 ≥ pc ≊ 0.5927, the critical site percolation probability, we have a large percolation cluster of gelled sites that permeates through out the material and turns the material into a gel. If (1 + e−α)−1 < pc then the material, as it ages, will not form a percolation cluster and therefore remain as a fluid. The critical value pc of the site-filling probability p can be transformed into a critical value αc of the rheological parameter α, in the absence of interaction (β = 0) and external stress (σ = 0) as follows:

From cou.: 242 α
From Soup: 242 The realisations of ā ( t ) when α = 0.2 < α c and β = 0 indicate no gel is being formed, i.e. , because the site-filling probability p = 1 + e −0.2 = 0.549834 is below the critical site percolation probability p c ≊ 0.5927. On the other hand, the realisations of ā ( t ) when α = 2 ≥ α c are consistent with a gel being formed, i.e. , since the site-filling probability p = 1 + e −2 ≊ 0.8808 is greater than p c .
 ###### 
From cou.: 243 c
From Soup: 243 If β > 0 then our model, being a particular parametric family of correlated site percolation, allows for the site-filling probability p i at site s to be site-specific by making it depend on i = x N s , the number of neighboring sites of s that are in phase 1. Thus, the site-filling probability changes site-specifically with the configuration x ( m ) at time m . If β ≥ 0 and α > α c then p i , the site-filling probability at every site s , in the absence of any external stress ( σ = 0), is at least as high as the critical percolation probability p c . This is sufficient for the formation of the percolation cluster and attain stress-free gelation. Recall that p c for site percolation is not known analytically but estimated consistently from Monte Carlo simulations even when β = 0. We can similarly obtain Monte Carlo estimates of a bi-partition of a large subset of the parameter space, say {( α , β ): α ∈ [10 −4 ,10] × [10 −4 ,10]}, into a gellable subset of parameters that lead to the formation of a gel and another ungellable subset of parameters that do not, using Algorithm 1.

From Soup: 244 For a given parameter value ( α , β ) in a set made from the union of logarithmically, linearly and quasi-randomly spaced points in [10 −4 ,10] 2 we can simulate site configurations x ( m ) according to Algorithm 1 with σ = 0 and initial fluid configuration x (0) = 0 as m approaches a large number, say 10 6 . Fig. 7 shows, over a grid of parameters in [10 −4 ,10] 2 , the nearly asymptotic value of , the proportion of the lattice with n 2 = 10 4 sites that is occupied by the largest cluster (connected component) of gelled sites at a large discrete time m = 10 6 or rescaled time t = 100 after each site has undergone h = 100 transitions on average. The set of ungellable parameters are estimated to be those whose and are highlighted by circles with black boundaries in the lower left corner of Fig. 7 . The set of parameters with are estimated to be gellable and depicted in Fig. 7 by shaded circles without a black boundary. These estimates are only based on one simulation per ( α , β ) and just meant to give a rough idea of gel formation. However, the characteristics of the bi-partition of the parameter space into gellable and ungellable regions are similar to Fig. 7 when we increased the lattice size n from 100 2 to 200 2 and the duration t from 100 to 200 (results not shown). By doing multiple independent simulations per parameter value over a larger lattice ( n > 10 4 ) and longer time ( t > 100) one can easily obtain asymptotically consistent estimates (with standard errors) for the ( α , β )-specific probability that as t → ∞ and n → ∞ using Algorithm 1.

On the other hand, the realisations of ā(t) when α = 2 ≥ αc are consistent with a gel being formed, i.e., since the site-filling probability p = 1 + e−2 ≊ 0.8808 is greater than pc.
From Soup: 245 From Fig. 7 it is clear that the material gets gelled in the absence of external stress not only when α > α c ≊ 0.37513 (the vertical line in Fig. 7 goes through α c ) but also for smaller values of α , provided β is large enough to compensate and increase the site-filling probability. In the sequel, we are mainly interested in values of α much larger than α c , say α = 8 without loss of generality, in order to focus on yield stress materials that can form a gel with a high probability under zero stress. This concludes our study of stress-free gelation, i.e. the possibility of a fluid to solid phase transition under zero external stress.
 ###### 
From cou.: 246 If β > 0 then our model, being a particular parametric family of correlated site percolation, allows for the site-filling probability pi at site s to be site-specific by making it depend on i = xNs, the number of neighboring sites of s that are in phase 1. Thus, the site-filling probability changes site-specifically with the configuration x(m) at time m. If β ≥ 0 and α > αc then pi, the site-filling probability at every site s, in the absence of any external stress (σ = 0), is at least as high as the critical percolation probability pc. This is sufficient for the formation of the percolation cluster and attain stress-free gelation. Recall that pc for site percolation is not known analytically but estimated consistently from Monte Carlo simulations even when β = 0. We can similarly obtain Monte Carlo estimates of a bi-partition of a large subset of the parameter space, say {(α,β): α ∈ [10−4,10] × [10−4,10]}, into a gellable subset of parameters that lead to the formation of a gel and another ungellable subset of parameters that do not, using Algorithm 1.

Fig. 7 shows, over a grid of parameters in [10−4,10]2, the nearly asymptotic value of , the proportion of the lattice with n2 = 104 sites that is occupied by the largest cluster (connected component) of gelled sites at a large discrete time m = 106 or rescaled time t = 100 after each site has undergone h = 100 transitions on average. The set of ungellable parameters are estimated to be those whose and are highlighted by circles with black boundaries in the lower left corner of Fig. 7.

By doing multiple independent simulations per parameter value over a larger lattice (n > 104) and longer time (t > 100) one can easily obtain asymptotically consistent estimates (with standard errors) for the (α,β)-specific probability that as t → ∞ and n → ∞ using Algorithm 1.

For both simulations we have used n = 100 and ( , β ) taken from a grid of linearly spaced points in [−10,15] × [0,4]. In both panels (a and b) of Fig. 8 one can note that if the interaction parameter is smaller than a critical value of the interaction parameter β < β c ( β c ≈ 1.5), both the solid–fluid and fluid–solid transitions are smooth. When the interaction parameter β is gradually increased past this critical value both transitions become increasingly sharp.

From cou.: 248 From Fig. 7 it is clear that the material gets gelled in the absence of external stress not only when α > αc ≊ 0.37513 (the vertical line in Fig. 7 goes through αc) but also for smaller values of α, provided β is large enough to compensate and increase the site-filling probability. In the sequel, we are mainly interested in values of α much larger than αc, say α = 8 without loss of generality, in order to focus on yield stress materials that can form a gel with a high probability under zero stress. This concludes our study of stress-free gelation, i.e. the possibility of a fluid to solid phase transition under zero external stress.

It is easy to understand this “patchy” pattern in site configurations with large positive β by realizing that new gelled sites can occur with a higher probability at sites neighboring existing gelled sites that have a larger i = x N s , number of neighbors in phase 1, than at sites surrounded by ungelled sites with a smaller i = x N s (see bottom two rows of Fig. 5 ). As β gets larger, the probability of forming gelled sites around existing gelled sites is much larger than that of forming gelled sites around ungelled sites, and this concentrates ( ā , ) about ( ā , ā ) = (1/2,1/2) at the solid–fluid interface.

From cou.: 258 When we increase β from 0 to 2 we have a very different distribution over site configurations at the solid–fluid interface as shown by two samples in the first (top) row of Fig. 9. It is easy to understand this “patchy” pattern in site configurations with large positive β by realizing that new gelled sites can occur with a higher probability at sites neighboring existing gelled sites that have a larger i = xNs, number of neighbors in phase 1, than at sites surrounded by ungelled sites with a smaller i = xNs (see bottom two rows of Fig. 5).

From Soup: 260 Using Monte Carlo simulations from Algorithm 2 of the time-inhomogeneous Markov chain { X ( m )} M m =0 given by (7) and (8), under an initially increasing and subsequently decreasing time-dependent stress σ ( m ) given in the bottom panel of Fig. 10 , we obtained multiple independent trajectories of Ā ( σ ), the fraction of gelled sites as a function of the external stress σ . Five such simulated trajectories are shown in the first four panels of Fig. 10 . In order to mimic an asymptotic steady state of deformation (which is typically what a rheologist would be interested in characterising during a rheological measurement) the holding time per stress value has been chosen large, h = 1000 hits per site. We note that regardless the value of the interaction parameter β the results of the five individual simulations overlap nearly perfectly which indicates that the grid size of the simulation is sufficiently large and the simulated trajectories are robust.
 ###### 
From cou.: 261 Thus, from the β-dependent site configurations at the solid–fluid interface depicted in Fig. 9, it is clear that the trajectories of tracer particles (see Fig. 1 of ref. 13 from ref. 27) that can only diffuse through the ungelled (black) contiguous regions are heavily dependent on whether there is interaction between adjacent gelled sites. This interaction is captured in our correlated site percolation model by the interaction parameter β.
From Soup: 261 For low values of the interaction parameter ( β ∈ {0,1}, top row of Fig. 10 ) the dependence ā ( σ ) corresponding to the decreasing branch of the stress ramp overlaps with that corresponding to the increasing branch and no hysteresis is observed. This indicates that in the presence of weak interactions and provided that an asymptotically steady state is reached the deformation states are fully reversible upon increasing/decreasing the external forces. In this case a smooth solid–fluid transition is observed.

One of our primary interests is to study Ā(t) and (t) as X(t) is under the influence of time-varying externally applied stress σ(t).
From Soup: 262 As the value of the interaction parameter is increased ( β ∈ {2,4}, middle row of Fig. 10 ) a significantly different yielding behaviour is observed. First, the deformation states are no longer reproducible upon increasing/decreasing stresses and a clear hysteresis is observed. Second, larger the value of the interaction parameter is, steeper the solid–fluid transition becomes.

Five such simulated trajectories are shown in the first four panels of Fig. 10. In order to mimic an asymptotic steady state of deformation (which is typically what a rheologist would be interested in characterising during a rheological measurement) the holding time per stress value has been chosen large, h = 1000 hits per site.

From Soup: 263 To conclude this part, the realizations of the time-inhomogeneous Markov chain under time-dependent stress σ ( m ) corresponding to an asymptotically steady forcing reveal a smooth and reversible solid–fluid transition if the interactions are either absent or weak and a steep and irreversible transition in the presence of strong interactions. This result is consistent with the result presented in Fig. 8 where we have seen that for β > β c a genuine irreversibility of the deformation state is observed during the steady yielding process. An experimental validation of these conclusions has been recently presented. 5 The rheological flow curves measured for a suspension of spherical and electrically charged non-motile micro algae ( Chlorella Vulgaris ) reveal an abrupt solid–fluid transition and exhibit a strong hysteresis even in the limit of very slow forcing, see Fig. 11 in ref. 5 . In the case of a Carbopol gel where the microscopic interactions are presumably weaker than the interactions between electrically charged Chlorella cell a much smoother solid fluid transition is observed and, in the asymptotic limit of steady forcing, the hysteresis effects become negligibly small. 13 This is perhaps the main reason why Carbopol gels have been considered for decades “ model ”, “ simple ” or “ ideal ” yield stress fluids.

From cou.: 264 For low values of the interaction parameter (β ∈ {0,1}, top row of Fig. 10) the dependence ā(σ) corresponding to the decreasing branch of the stress ramp overlaps with that corresponding to the increasing branch and no hysteresis is observed. This indicates that in the presence of weak interactions and provided that an asymptotically steady state is reached the deformation states are fully reversible upon increasing/decreasing the external forces. In this case a smooth solid–fluid transition is observed.

From cou.: 265 As the value of the interaction parameter is increased (β ∈ {2,4}, middle row of Fig. 10) a significantly different yielding behaviour is observed. First, the deformation states are no longer reproducible upon increasing/decreasing stresses and a clear hysteresis is observed. Second, larger the value of the interaction parameter is, steeper the solid–fluid transition becomes.
From Soup: 265 A large number of flows of yield stress fluids are unsteady in the sense that the applied stress is maintained for a finite time t 0 . For the case of a rheometric configuration, we have illustrated the unsteady response of the material in Fig. 2 . An important feature of the deformation curves presented in Fig. 2 is the irreversibility of the deformation states upon increasing/decreasing applied stresses. The magnitude of this effect is found to depend systematically on the degree of steadiness of the forcing, the time t 0 the applied stress is maintained constant ( Fig. 3 ).
 ###### 
From cou.: 266 To conclude this part, the realizations of the time-inhomogeneous Markov chain under time-dependent stress σ(m) corresponding to an asymptotically steady forcing reveal a smooth and reversible solid–fluid transition if the interactions are either absent or weak and a steep and irreversible transition in the presence of strong interactions. This result is consistent with the result presented in Fig. 8 where we have seen that for β > βc a genuine irreversibility of the deformation state is observed during the steady yielding process. An experimental validation of these conclusions has been recently presented.5 The rheological flow curves measured for a suspension of spherical and electrically charged non-motile micro algae (Chlorella Vulgaris) reveal an abrupt solid–fluid transition and exhibit a strong hysteresis even in the limit of very slow forcing, see Fig. 11 in ref. 5. In the case of a Carbopol gel where the microscopic interactions are presumably weaker than the interactions between electrically charged Chlorella cell a much smoother solid fluid transition is observed and, in the asymptotic limit of steady forcing, the hysteresis effects become negligibly small.13 This is perhaps the main reason why Carbopol gels have been considered for decades “model”, “simple” or “ideal” yield stress fluids.
From Soup: 266 The question we address in the following is to what extent is our Gibbs field model able to describe the unsteady yielding behaviour observed in macroscopic experiments. To answer this question we calculate trajectories ā similar to those presented in Fig. 10 which are realised during an increasing/decreasing stress ramp (see the bottom panel of Fig. 10 ).

From cou.: 267 3.4.1 Effect of holding time (steadiness of the external forcing) on the hysteresis.
From Soup: 267 To place ourselves in the conditions of an unsteady forcing, we chose during the simulations finite values of the holding time (or average number of hits per site). We note that the average holding time per site in our simulations is the closest equivalent we could find for the characteristic forcing time t 0 imposed during macroscopic rheological measurements, see Fig. 2 and 3 and the discussion in Section 1. To quantify the degree of reversibility of the deformation states, we calculate after each run the area of the hysteresis encompassed by the increasing/decreasing branches of the dependence ā = ā ( σ ).
 ###### 
From cou.: 268 A large number of flows of yield stress fluids are unsteady in the sense that the applied stress is maintained for a finite time t0. For the case of a rheometric configuration, we have illustrated the unsteady response of the material in Fig. 2. An important feature of the deformation curves presented in Fig. 2 is the irreversibility of the deformation states upon increasing/decreasing applied stresses. The magnitude of this effect is found to depend systematically on the degree of steadiness of the forcing, the time t0 the applied stress is maintained constant (Fig. 3).
From Soup: 268 The dependencies of the hysteresis area on the holding time obtained from such simulations performed for a fixed value of the site threshold α and several values of the interaction parameter β are presented in Fig. 11 .

From cou.: 269 The question we address in the following is to what extent is our Gibbs field model able to describe the unsteady yielding behaviour observed in macroscopic experiments. To answer this question we calculate trajectories ā similar to those presented in Fig. 10 which are realised during an increasing/decreasing stress ramp (see the bottom panel of Fig. 10).
From Soup: 269 Regardless the strength β of the interaction, a non monotone dependence of the hysteresis area on the holding time is obtained. By carefully inspecting the individual dependencies ā = ā ( σ ), we have noticed that prior to the local maximum the lattice yields only partially ( ā never reaches 0) corresponding to the largest value of the applied stress σ . Corresponding to the local maxima t 0 * of the dependencies presented in Fig. 11 the lattice yields completely (the terminal value of ā is 0) and the area of the hysteresis starts decaying with the holding time t 0 . This behaviour of the degree of irreversibility of deformation states as a function of the steadiness of the forcing is qualitatively similar to the experimental results illustrated in Fig. 3 . In the absence of interactions ( β = 0), the hysteresis area follows a log-normal correlation with the holding time (see the circles and the dashed line in Fig. 11 ) which once more comes into a qualitative agreement with the experimental results. For non zero values of β we could not accurately fit the data by a log-normal function. Corresponding to the largest values of the average number of hits per site we have tested, we have found a power law decay of the hysteresis area, the full lines ( Fig. 11 ) which is once again similar to the behaviour illustrated in Fig. 3 and consistent with experimental results obtained with Carbopol gels. 13,15

From Soup: 270 It is equally interesting to note that stronger the interaction is (larger the parameter β is), weaker the decay of the hysteresis area with the characteristic forcing time t 0 is. This indicates that in the presence of strong interactions a full reversibility of the deformation states can not be achieved regardless the degree of steadiness of the external forcing. This is indeed the case of several highly thixotropic materials such as bentonite gels, LAPONITE® gels where steady state rheological measurements can not be truly achieved even during very slow controlled stress flow ramps. Among the data we illustrate in Fig. 2 and 3 , the mayonnaise seems to behave as such as well.

From cou.: 271 The dependencies of the hysteresis area on the holding time obtained from such simulations performed for a fixed value of the site threshold α and several values of the interaction parameter β are presented in Fig. 11.
From Soup: 271 In summary, using a site-specific threshold α and an interaction constant β as two fixed parameters for a given material, and an externally applied stress σ , we derive a thermodynamically consistent correlated site percolation model over a toroidal square lattice. This Markov chain over the space of site configurations can be simulated using Gibbs sampling schemes given by Algorithms 1 and 2. The simulations from Algorithms 1 and 2 were used to gain several macroscopic insights about the solid fluid transition in yield stress fluids and were found to be in qualitative and quantitative agreement with known empirical results. For example, our model accounts for the effect of non-zero β on preferred site configurations at the solid–fluid interface when ā = 1/2 as shown in Fig. 9 . The β -dependent micro-structure of the interface at this bulk gel point clearly influences the motion of the micro-sized tracer particles as studied by ref. 26 (but only for the non-interactive case with β = 0). For example it is clear from the configurations close to the gel point that a large negative β creates a chess-board pattern of gelled and ungelled sites that would prohibit the motion of tracers from their most recent positions while a large positive β with agglomerative clumping of gelled sites allows more navigable room for the tracers. de Bruyn 26 concludes that their simulations (with β = 0) do not reproduce the scaling behaviour displayed by the microrheological moduli in experiments on materials near their gel point. Although we do not pursue the properties of tracer particle motion at the gel point in this work we expect it to be an interesting future pursuit using non-zero values of β .

From Soup: 272 Our model provides several interesting insights into the yielding transition. In the limit of an asymptotically steady forcing (a constant stress is maintained over very long times), the steepness of the solid–fluid transition is solely controlled by the magnitude of the interactions, β . In the absence of interactions or in the presence of weak interactions, the solid–fluid transition is smooth and the deformation states are reversible upon increasing/decreasing stresses, see panels (a, b) in Fig. 10 . If the interaction parameter is increased past a critical value β c ≈ 1.5, the solid–fluid transition becomes increasingly steeper and irreversible upon increasing and decreasing stresses, see panels (c, d) in Fig. 10 . Qualitatively, this results is in good agreement with the rheological measurements performed on highly thixotropic materials (see for example panel (a) in Fig. 2 ) which reveal a rheological hysteresis even in the conditions of a steady state forcing.

This comes into a good agreement with the unsteady rheological measurements performed with aqueous solutions of Carbopol at various concentrations and operating temperature, see panel (c) in Fig. 2 and ref. 13–15 . We find that, regardless the strength β of the interactions, the magnitude of the hysteresis depends non monotonically on the degree of steadiness of the forcing t 0 , Fig. 11 which once more agrees qualitatively with the experimental observations illustrated in Fig. 3 .

From Soup: 274 In closing, in spite of a very limited number of parameters involved (namely α and β ), the Gibbs field model presented through our manuscript is able to capture the main qualitative features of the solid–fluid transition of a yield stress material subjected to either steadily or unsteadily varying external stresses. Bearing in mind that we did not assign any particular constitutive relation to the solid and fluid phases and we did not account for the motion of solid and fluid elements during the transition (there exists no equivalent of the shear rate in our model) one may suggest that the main qualitative features of the yielding process we have highlighted in Section 1 originate from the stochastic nature of the destruction and re-formation of solid structural units and not from the rheological properties of the phases. In this regard our model is quite universal and might be used to describe the yielding of a broad class of molecularly different materials.

In the limit of an asymptotically steady forcing (a constant stress is maintained over very long times), the steepness of the solid–fluid transition is solely controlled by the magnitude of the interactions, β. In the absence of interactions or in the presence of weak interactions, the solid–fluid transition is smooth and the deformation states are reversible upon increasing/decreasing stresses, see panels (a, b) in Fig. 10. If the interaction parameter is increased past a critical value βc ≈ 1.5, the solid–fluid transition becomes increasingly steeper and irreversible upon increasing and decreasing stresses, see panels (c, d) in Fig. 10. Qualitatively, this results is in good agreement with the rheological measurements performed on highly thixotropic materials (see for example panel (a) in Fig. 2) which reveal a rheological hysteresis even in the conditions of a steady state forcing.
From Soup: 275 First, a more detailed model that simultaneously represents the fraction of gelled sites and the fraction of bonds in one dependent system would provide a better quantitative and qualitative approximation of the correlated site percolation model. Second, an alternative interesting extension of our model could involve allowing for solvent effects through a model akin to correlated site-bond percolation of ref. 33 Sec. D.II., p.136 but with our focus on external stress as opposed to temperature. In such a model we have an additional parameter that allows for a site to be occupied by a monomer with probability ϕ and by the solvent with probability 1 − ϕ . Third, we believe it would be interesting to extend the micro-rheological study first initiated by de Bruyn 26 by considering lattices generated from the Gibbs algorithm we have presented during various stages of the solid–fluid transition.

From Soup: 298 In a site percolation model, a randomly chosen fraction p of sites are set to be in phase 1; these sites represent gelled regions of the material while the remaining sites in phase 0 represent ungelled or fluid regions. In our approach we treat α , the site-specific threshold, and β , the interaction constant, as fixed parameters that characterize the nature of the given yield stress material. When we study the possible gelation of a material with a given α and β we do not think of varying the site-filling probability directly, as in ref. 26 , but rather let it be defined by α and β in a possibly configuration-dependent manner. Thus our approach to modeling gelation is not only microscopic but also mechanistic, in terms of allowing the nature of stochastic evolution in the configuration space to depend on the fixed rheological parameters α and β . Our non-interactive model ( β = 0) in the presence of a constant external stress ( σ ∈ [0,∞)) is the site percolation model over n with site-filling probability p = (1 + e σ − α ) −1 . In the absence of external stress with σ = 0 we have the site percolation model with site-filling probability p = (1 + e − α ) −1 . As p increases from 0, the size of the largest connected region of gelled sites grows and at a critical probability p = p c ≊ 0.5927 (for large n ) a percolation cluster that spans the entire lattice n appears when for site configuration x . We note that the value of p c for site percolation, unlike for bond percolation where we only track the presence or absence of bonds between adjacent sites, is not yet known exactly (although various inequalities, identities and asymptotically consistent point estimates are known 37 for e.g. see Sec. 5.3,6.1,6.4). Finally, site percolation is more general than bond percolation and can, at least in principle, be used to model richer phenomena. Our interpretation of the site configuration where each site is either bondable or unbondable and its associated edge configuration where only two neighboring bondable sites form a bond, is not as strict as the interpretation in the random-site percolation model of ref. 33 Sec. C.V.1, p.130 that “bonds between sites always exist”. In our interpretation, bonds between sites only exist if two neighboring sites are bondable, i.e. , they are both in phase 1.

From Soup: 300 Our model is closely related to the embedded discrete time Markov chain in the classical voter process 36 Ch. 5 of probability theory, whereby at each site a voter casts one of two votes (0 or 1) by copying the vote of one of its randomly chosen four nearest neighbors in n . If the voter at each site chooses one of its four neighbors uniformly at random, then the voter model corresponds to our model with More generally, one can allow 0 ≤ p 0 ≤ p 1 ≤ p 2 ≤ p 3 ≤ p 4 ≤ 1 to recover a corresponding voter process that is possibly influenced by the neighboring votes. Thus, in the square lattice n with four nearest neighbors, every point ( p 0 , p 1 ,…, p 4 ) in Δ 4 , the unit 4-simplex containing the set of all probability mass functions over {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, defines a voter process.

However, in our model the probabilities are non-extreme, i.e. , 0 < p 0 < 1 and 0 < p 1 < 1, and thus our Markov chain is irreducible and aperiodic (due to self-transitions) on the large but finite configuration space n . Moreover, when β < 0, the corresponding model with 1 > p 0 > p 1 > p 2 > p 3 > p 4 > 0 (see top row of Fig. 5 ) is akin to the anti-voter model 36 p. 162.

Then the set of edges between pairs of sites is In other words, we say that sites and are connected, , = 1, if and only if = = 1 and and are neighbors. Otherwise, we say and are unconnected, , = 0. These definitions are schematically illustrated in . Since the phase of sites determine their connectedness, we refer to sites in phase 1 as connectable and those in phase 0 as unconnectable. Thus, every site configuration ∈ := has an associated edge configuration ∈ := which characterizes the connectivity information between all pairs of neighboring sites. We use to denote a random site configuration and = ( ) to denote the associated random edge configuration. Two extreme site configurations are := { = 1: ∈ } ∈ , with all sites gelled, and := { = 0: ∈ } ∈ , with all sites ungelled. Their corresponding extreme edge configurations are := { = 1: 〈 , 〉 ∈ } ∈ , with all neighboring pairs of sites connected and thus making the material to be in a fully solid state, and := { = 0: 〈 , 〉 ∈ } ∈ , with all neighboring pairs of sites unconnected and thus making the material to be in a fully fluid state, respectively. Note that ( ): → is neither injective nor surjective. where is the normalizing constant or partition function. By ∼ , we mean that the random site configuration has probability distribution , , and where { } is the singleton clique, 〈 , 〉 is the doubleton clique with ∈ , ≥ 0 is the external stress applied, ≥ 0 is the site-specific threshold, and ∈ (−∞,∞) is the interaction constant between neighboring sites. The parameters and can be thought to reflect fundamental rheological properties of the material under study. where In this work we focus on the effect of varying external stress at a constant ambient temperature, and therefore without loss of generality, we take = 1 and work with ( ) = exp(− ( )). where, the | | × | | transition probability matrix over any pair of configurations ( , ′) ∈ × is and = ( , , , ), is indeed a function of the site and the three parameters: , and . By ∥ − ′∥ = 1 we mean that the configurations and ′ differ at exactly site , , ≠ ′. Similarly, by ∥ − ′∥ = 0 we mean that the two configurations are identical, , − ′ or ≠ ′ at every site ∈ . We can think of our Markov chain evolving according to the following probabilistic rules based on (2) and (3): and set = 0 with probability 1 − . When = 0 the model is said to be non-interactive since the probability of a site being in phase 1 is independent of the phase of the neighboring sites and identically at each site, , When < 0, our model captures the anti-agglomerative interactions that are analogous to the anti-ferromagnetic interactions of the Ising model, Sec. C.V.4, p.133 since the probability of a site being in phase 1 decreases with the number of its neighboring sites also being in phase 1, , if < 0 then and the -step configuration probability, with < under initial distribution , given by As before, ( ) is modulo . from the Markov chain { ( )} given by (4) and (5) and initialized at (0) as it undergoes = [ ] transitions in . and therefore where ∈ (−∞,∞) and = − ≥ − for a given ≥ 0. Since the energy of a configuration , given , only depends on its ( ) and ( ), we can easily visualize any sample path ( (0),…, ( )) ∈ in configuration space that is outputted by either Algorithm 1 or Algorithm 2 as the following sequence of ( + 1) ordered pairs in the unit square:

From cou.: 309 Our model with β ≠ 0 allows for correlation between the phases due to nearest-neighbor interactions. This is nearly the same as the correlated site percolation model of ref. 33, Sec. C.V.3, p.131. One crucial difference is that we have thermal temperature as well as external stress in our parametrization and focus on the system behaviour under variable external stress and constant temperature for a given pair of rheological parameters α and β.
From cou.: 310 B.4 Ising model.
From cou.: 311 Our model can be reparametrized as the Ising model29,30 with phases given by {−1,+1} for the ferromagnetic spins due to the well-known transformation (for e.g. see Problem 3, Chapter 138). Despite this mathematical equivalence, one looses interpretability of yielded and unyielded states of the microscopic clumps readily available in the correlated site percolation with phases in {0,1}.
From cou.: 312 Here we present the two main algorithms for Gibbs sampling. Algorithm 1 produces a sample path in the space of site configurations under a homogeneous Markov chain with a given initial condition x(0) and rheological parameters α and β, external constant stress σ and holding time h. Algorithm 2 similarly produces a sample path under an inhomogeneous Markov chain.
