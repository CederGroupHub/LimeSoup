From cou.: 1 The cross-linking structures of ultraviolet (UV) and electron beam (EB)-cured acrylic copolymer resins prepared with pentaerythritol triacrylate and 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (VP) mixtures were characterized using high resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) combined with supercritical methanolysis. Methyl acrylate (MA)/VP co-oligomers were formed via methanolysis through selective cleavage and methylation at the ester linkages in the radiation-cured resins, which reflected the cross-linking junctions. Almost all of the products were completely separated in the high-resolution spiral TOFMS spectra, including the isotope peaks for a slight mass difference of Δm/z ≃ 0.05. Two types of the copolymeric methanolysis products with different terminal structures were identified for up to 11-mers at approximately m/z 1300 on the MALDI mass spectra. The distributions of the products observed in the mass spectra were interpreted in terms of the original structures of the cured resin samples to reflect the curing reactions.

From cou.: 2 Ultraviolet (UV) and electron beam (EB) curable acrylic ester resins have been widely used in various industrial materials, such as paints, inks, adhesives and resins for 3D stereolithography.1 Although both curing processes are based upon free radical polymerization induced by the energy of the UV/EB irradiation, there are some key differences between them. In the UV curing process, polymerization proceeds via free radicals generated from photoinitiators, whereas the EB curing process does not use photoinitiators. Polymerization begins with the formation of free-radicals from the monomers and/or prepolymers via EB irradiation.2 However, the detailed reaction mechanisms for EB curing have not yet been clarified. Even when used on the same formulations, the properties of resins resulting from UV and EB irradiations are often considerably different.

From cou.: 3 Characterization of the cross-linking network structures of radiation-cured resins is necessary to clarify the curing processes. However, it is generally challenging to analyze cured resins mainly because of their insoluble nature, although solid-state NMR has been utilized to study the heterogeneity of network structures in photo-cured resins.3,4 To avoid this limitation we evaluated the cross-linking structures of UV-cured acrylic ester resins prepared from dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate (DPHA) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) combined with supercritical methanolysis.5,6 In this case, the UV-cured DPHA was selectively decomposed at the ester linkages to give poly(methyl acrylates) (PMAs) that reflected the cross-linking sequences and the PMAs were observed in the MALDI-mass spectra of the decomposition products as their sodium cationized molecules. The methanolysis products were fractionated using size exclusion chromatography followed by MALDI-MS measurements of the individual fractions. The observed distribution of a series of PMAs suggested that the network junctions in the UV-cured resin sample were composed of up to approximately 2000 acrylate units.

From cou.: 4 Copolymer-type, radiation-curable resins are composed of several types of monomers and prepolymers to ensure various properties, such as flexibility, solubility, adhesion, curing speed and mechanical strength of the resulting resins. The network structure in radiation-cured copolymer resins prepared with pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA) and 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (VP) mixtures was characterized using MALDI-TOFMS combined with supercritical methanolysis.7 Although the decomposition of the cured PETA/VP resins into methyl acrylate (MA)/VP copolymers via supercritical methanolysis was successful, the exact assignment of the observed peaks was difficult because of the insufficient resolution of the conventional TOFMS for the MALDI mass spectra of the complex MA/VP copolymeric methanolysis products.

From cou.: 5 Recently, a novel MALDI-TOFMS system with a spiral ion trajectory was developed.8–10 The long flight distance of the ions in the spiral-TOFMS (approximately 17 m) drastically improves the mass resolution up to approximately 80000. The high-resolution MALDI-spiral-TOFMS allows for the separation of isobaric compounds in the analysis of poly(ethylene glycol)–poly(propylene glycol) block copolymers.10,11 In the observed high-resolution mass spectra, doublet peaks with only 0.03 m/z difference, which originated from different combinations of EO and PO units, can be clearly resolved. In addition, this technique has been successfully applied to the detailed analysis of free radical polymerized methacrylate ester copolymers.12

From cou.: 7 The UV- and EB-cured copolymer resin samples were the same as those used in previous work.7 The samples were radiation-cured copolymer resins prepared with PETA and VP and were purchased from Kyoeisha Chemical Co., Ltd, Osaka, Japan and Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd, Osaka, Japan, respectively. The photoinitiator, 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (DMPA; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd, Osaka, Japan), was utilized for UV curing without further purification. The UV curable monomers with various compositions (PETA:VP = 2:1, 1:1 and 2:3 molar functionality ratios) were mixed with the DMPA initiator. UV curing was performed in air by passing a UV-curable mixture on a plate through a conveyor-type UV-curing equipment with a medium-pressure mercury lamp (80 W cm−1 and total output 2 kW). EB curing was conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature using a scanning-type electron beam processing system. The EB curable monomer mixture (PETA:VP = 1:1) on the stainless steel plate without any photoinitiator was irradiated at a dose of either 20 or 40 J g−1. The UV- and EB-cured resin samples are listed in Table 1 with the compositions and curing conditions.

From cou.: 8 Scheme 1 shows the typical UV and EB curing pathways for the PETA/VP resins. In the UV curing process, active free radicals are generated upon UV exposure in the presence of suitable photoinitiators via the homolytic C–C bond scission of DMPA. The active free radicals initiate the photopolymerization of PETA and VP. Meanwhile, in the EB curing process, which does not use photoinitiators, the polymerization might be initiated via a free radical formed from the EB irradiation, although a detailed reaction mechanism has not yet been clarified. These active species initiate the copolymerization of PETA and VP to form the cross-linked resin structure.

From cou.: 9 The apparatus and procedure for supercritical methanolysis are almost the same as those used in our previous work.5–7 The autoclave was made of a stainless steel (SUS 316) tube (1/4 inch φ, ca. 7 cm long) with an inner volume of 1 mL and both ends of the tube were sealed with V-Lok caps (Fujikin Inc., Osaka, Japan). Prior to supercritical methanolysis, the cured resin sample was ground into a fine powder using a cryogenic sample crusher (JFC-300; Japan Analytical Industry Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) at liquid nitrogen temperature to improve the efficiency of the methanolysis. Approximately 2 mg of the ground resin sample was placed into the autoclave with 0.7 mL of methanol. The sealed autoclave was heated at 290 °C for 2 h in a gas-chromatograph oven. Under these conditions, the methanol in the reaction tube was in a supercritical state over the critical point. Scheme 1 also illustrates the most probable decomposition reaction for the radiation-cured PETA/VP resins into the MA/VP copolymer in the supercritical methanol. After heating for the prescribed period (2 h), the autoclave was cooled down in a water bath, the decomposed products were taken out of the autoclave, and the inner wall of the tube was washed using tetrahydrofuran. The methanolysis products were dried under vacuum at 60 °C, and the obtained solid products were dissolved in 0.5 mL of chloroform to be analysed using the MALDI-high resolution-TOFMS.

From cou.: 10 4-Hydroxybenzylidene malononitrile (HBMN; Alfa Aesar, UK) was used without further purification as the matrix reagent for sample ionization. Sodium iodide (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd, Osaka, Japan) was used as the cationization salt. Two microliters of a 2 mg mL−1 sodium iodide solution in tetrahydrofuran, 10 μL of the methanolysis product solution in chloroform and 10 μL of a 17 mg mL−1 HBMN solution in tetrahydrofuran were mixed in a microtube. An aliquot (0.1 μL) of the mixed solution was dropped on a sample plate, dried and then subjected to MALDI-MS measurement. MALDI-mass spectra were acquired in spiral mode using high resolution LDI-TOFMS (JMS-3000; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The ionization was performed using a Nd:YLF laser (349 nm) with a 0.5 ns pulse width and 250 Hz frequency. The ions generated by laser desorption were introduced into the flight tube with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and separated in a positive spiral mode. The mass spectra were acquired by averaging 100 individual laser shots with the delay time set to 150 ns. The measurement ranges were set to m/z 500–4000. The mass calibration in the range m/z 500–2000 was accomplished using poly(ethylene glycol) (peak top molar mass ca. m/z 1540) as an external standard. For comparison, MALDI-MS measurements of the methanolysis products were also taken using a conventional-LDI-TOFMS (KRATOS AXIMA CFR-plus; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), which was used in previous work7 under comparable conditions.

From cou.: 11 Fig. 1 shows the MALDI mass spectra of the methanolysis products of UV-1:1 obtained using (a) the conventional TOFMS (KRATOS AXIMA CFR-plus) in reflector mode and (b) the high-resolution spiral-TOFMS (JMS-S3000). The overall view (Fig. 1 (bottom)) shows a series of products up to approximately m/z ∼2000 for both mass spectra. As shown in the expanded mass spectra (middle), the observed S/N ratio is much higher for the high-resolution spectra (b). In the further expanded spectra (top), the peaks of the products are clearly separated with an m/z difference of approximately 1 even by the conventional TOFMS in reflector mode. Although this separation can be mainly attributed to the difference in the amount of 13C in the products, the relative intensities of the observed peaks were not consistent with the isotope peak pattern.

From cou.: 12 However, the corresponding peaks were considerably sharper in high resolution-TOFMS. The observed resolution of the peaks in the high-resolution mass spectrum was approximately 50000, whereas it was approximately 3000 in conventional-TOFMS. Furthermore, in the high-resolution spectrum, the peaks at approximately m/z 861.4 clearly consist of a doublet with a slight m/z difference of 0.0547, which appeared as a single peak in the mass spectrum obtained using conventional TOFMS. This observation indicates that at least two different types of compounds with an m/z 861 were formed during the methanolysis of the copolymeric resins. In the case of the copolymer system, the observed mass spectrum generally became very complex because the number of possible components increased compared to that of the homopolymer. Therefore, the high-resolution MS system is essential to characterize, in detail, the copolymeric products obtained via methanolysis of the cured PETA/VP resins.

From cou.: 13 Based on the exact mass observed using high-resolution MS, the methanolysis products of the cured PETA/VP resin were identified for the m/z region of 860–863, as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2. The assignments were given considering that the observed products should be sodium-cationized molecules of the MA/VP copolymers. The main peak at m/z 860.4150 (observed exact mass; Exp.) was assumed to be a monoisotopic ion because the peaks observed at approximately m/z 859.4 are much smaller. Thus, the peak was assigned as a MA/VP copolymer with two saturated terminals, which was denoted as a type B product, consisting of six MA and three VP units (B 6:3). The theoretical accurate mass (Calc.; m/z 860.4151) of the polymer is almost identical to the observed exact mass of m/z 860.4150. A possible structure of B 6:3 is shown in Fig. 2 but different arrangements of the monomer units (at chain ends) are possible. Moreover, the left peaks of the doublets at m/z 861.4 and 862.4 were attributed to the corresponding isotope peaks containing one (Calc. m/z 861.4184, Exp. m/z 861.4178) and two 13C (Calc. m/z 862.4212, Exp. m/z 862.4203), respectively. These products are abbreviated as B1 6:3 and B2 6:3, and the superscripts, 1 and 2, correspond to the number of 13C isotopes.

From cou.: 14 Meanwhile, the right peaks of the doublets are another series of products. From their observed exact masses, m/z 861.4725 and 862.4745, the products were identified as copolymers with an unsaturated and a saturated terminal (a possible structure is shown in Fig. 2) and were denoted as type A products consisting of two MA and six VP units. One peak corresponds to the monoisotopic peak (Calc. m/z 861.4733) and the other is the isotope peak with a 13C (Calc. m/z 862.4764). They are abbreviated as A 2:6 and A1 2:6, respectively. Table 2 summarizes the main methanolysis products of the UV-cured copolymer resin in the m/z region of 860–863. The observed result in this region suggests that the cured resin used in this work is chiefly decomposed into either a type A or B product. The formation of type A methanolysis products has been already confirmed in previous work using the conventional TOFMS system.7

 ###### 
From cou.: 15 Scheme 2 shows the possible methanolysis pathway of the UV-cured PETA/VP resin to form type A and B products. UV curing with DMPA is initiated by a benzoyl radical produced by the photodissociation of DMPA, which is incorporated into the terminals in the cured resins. When the propagation reaction terminates by a hydrogen abstraction, the general structure of the UV-cured resin should be that shown in Scheme 2.

 ###### 
From cou.: 16 However, because the observed methanolysis products (type A and B products) do not have any benzoyl terminal groups, the initiator residue at the chain end of the cured resin should be eliminated during methanolysis as well as the ester bond cleavages in the PETA units to form MA units. The type A products can be formed through a CO–CH2 bond cleavage to eliminate the initiator residue, whereas the neighboring CH2–CH2 bond scission leads to the type B product. The type A and B products can also be produced through the main chain C–C cleavages. However, the contribution of the main chain cleavage is considered to be minor and the chain end elimination should be predominant because the methanolysis products with benzoyl terminals are almost completely missing from the MALDI mass spectra.

From Soup: 29 Fig. 6 shows the MALDI mass spectra of the methanolysis products from an EB-cured resin sample (EB-1 : 1 20) (b) compared to that of the UV-cured resin sample with the same copolymer composition (UV-1 : 1) (a) shown in Fig. 4 . Despite the original resins having the same copolymer composition, the observed mass spectra of the products are fairly different between the UV- and EB-cured samples. Fig. 7 shows the expanded MALDI mass spectra of the methanolysis products of (a) UV-1 : 1, (b) EB-1 : 1 20 and (c) EB-1 : 1 40 in the 9-mer region. The detected species are mainly common A and B type products for the UV- and EB-cured resins. The individual composition distributions for the A and B type products in the n -mers were calculated using eqns (1) and (2) and were fairly similar for UV-1 : 1 and EB-1 : 1.

From cou.: 30 Fig. 6 shows the MALDI mass spectra of the methanolysis products from an EB-cured resin sample (EB-1:1 20) (b) compared to that of the UV-cured resin sample with the same copolymer composition (UV-1:1) (a) shown in Fig. 4. Despite the original resins having the same copolymer composition, the observed mass spectra of the products are fairly different between the UV- and EB-cured samples. Fig. 7 shows the expanded MALDI mass spectra of the methanolysis products of (a) UV-1:1, (b) EB-1:1 20 and (c) EB-1:1 40 in the 9-mer region. The detected species are mainly common A and B type products for the UV- and EB-cured resins. The individual composition distributions for the A and B type products in the n-mers were calculated using eqns (1) and (2) and were fairly similar for UV-1:1 and EB-1:1.
From Soup: 30 However, the relative yields of A and B type products are considerably different between the UV- and EB-cured resins, as shown in Fig. 7 . In the case of the UV-cured resins, the relative yields are fairly comparable between the A and B type products. This fact indicates that the chain end C–C bond cleavages in the UV-cured resins to eliminate the initiator fragment (shown in Scheme 2 ) proceed with a similar probability at the CO–CH 2 (for A type) and the adjacent CH 2 –CH 2 linkages (for B type). Meanwhile, for the EB-cured resins, the peaks of the A type products are clearly more intense than those of the corresponding B type products. Furthermore, in the apparent A type isotopic peak pattern for the EB-cured resins, the peaks corresponding to two larger m / z than the monoisotopic peaks are more prominent compared to the possible isotopic peak pattern. Whereas, in the case of UV-cured resins, the A type products show ordinary isotopic peak patterns. The exact m / z difference between the monoisotopic peak and the prominent peak was, for example, 2.0131 for A 5 : 4 in EB-1 : 1 20, which is almost the same as the theoretical m / z for H 2 , 2.0156. This value indicates that the prominent peaks should not be attributed to the isotopic peak of A type products but should be attributed to the monoisotopic peak of the hydrogenated A type species, abbreviated as A + H 2 . This specific observation for the methanolysis products of EB-cured resins is more distinct for the higher irradiated sample, EB 1 : 1 40 than for EB 1 : 1 20.

From Soup: 31 The unique MALDI-MS pattern for the EB-cured resin samples is interpreted in terms of the EB curing processes. Scheme 3 shows the estimated polymerization mechanisms in EB curing and the following supercritical methanolysis pathways. If the monomer compound dissociates into a hydrogen radical and a residual monomer radical, both radicals can initiate the polymerization reaction to form the cured PETA/VP copolymer resins. When the residual monomer radical initiates the polymerization, the resultant cured resin could have an unsaturated terminal, as shown in the left pathway in Scheme 3 . The cured resin is then subjected to supercritical methanolysis and the ester bond cleavages should preferentially proceed to form type A products. To produce type B products from the cured resin, a C–C bond cleavage must occur, which is not a favourable reaction in supercritical methanolysis. As a result, the yields of the A type products are much higher than those of the B type for EB curing, as shown in Fig. 6 and 7 .

From Soup: 32 On the other hand, when the hydrogen radical initiates the polymerization, the cured copolymer resins with saturated terminals, shown in the right pathway in Scheme 3 , can be obtained. From this cured resin structure, hydrogenated A type (A + H 2 ) of MA/VP copolymers might be preferentially obtained along with a small quantity of B type products through subsidiary C–C bond cleavages. In addition, at a higher EB irradiation dose, different reaction mechanisms can contribute to form additional hydrogen radicals. As a result, the relative yields of the A + H 2 products are higher for the higher irradiation dose (EB-1 : 1 40), as shown in Fig. 7 .

From Soup: 33 The cross-linking structures in UV- and EB-cured PETA/VP resins were characterized in detail using high-resolution MALDI-TOFMS combined with supercritical methanolysis. Two types of MA/VP copolymeric species with different terminal structures (A type with an unsaturated chain end and B type with two saturated chain ends) were observed up to 11-mer at approximately m / z 1300 in the MALDI mass spectra of the methanolysis products in every sample. Almost all of the products were completely separated in the spectra, including the isotope peaks, using high-resolution spiral TOFMS. In the case of the UV-cured resins, the relative yields of the two types of the products were fairly comparable. The composition distributions of the products for each n -mer changed depending on the copolymer compositions of the original cured resins. The observed MALDI-mass spectra of the methanolysis products for the EB-cured resins were different from those for the UV-cured resins, although the composition distributions in the methanolysis products were similar for the UV-cured resins with the same copolymer compositions. However, the relative yields of A type of products were much higher than those of B type for EB curing. Moreover, the formation of hydrogenated A type methanolysis products was confirmed for EB-cured resins and the yield of the hydrogenated products increased with an increase in the EB irradiation dose. The observed unique MALDI-MS patterns of the methanolysis products of the EB-cured samples were interpreted in terms of the mechanisms of the EB curing, in which the polymerization could be initiated either by a hydrogen radical or a residual monomer radical. The results demonstrate that the combination of high-resolution MALDI-TOFMS and supercritical methanolysis can be a powerful technique to characterize the complex cross-linking structure in irradiation-cured copolymeric resins, even for EB-cured resins with unclarified reaction mechanisms.
