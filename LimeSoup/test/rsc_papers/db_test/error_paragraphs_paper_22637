From cou.: 1 We show that monodisperse iron oxide nanoparticles in the size range of 6–17 nm, coated with brush-like layers of polystyrene or polyisoprene of different molecular weights, form well-defined lyotropic liquid crystalline phases. The lyotropic phase behaviour was investigated by synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering. With increasing concentration, the polymer-coated nanoparticles show a disorder–order transition into well ordered bcc- or fcc-phases, depending on nanoparticle size and polymer molecular weights. The lyotropic phases can be shear oriented to obtain macroscopic highly ordered single crystalline nanoparticle superlattices exhibiting more than 100 Bragg-peaks. Within the ordered phases, the distance between adjacent nanoparticles can be varied systematically via concentration and attached polymer molecular weights in a range of 10–40 nm. We further demonstrate the versatility of lithographically patterned microstructured sample holders in combination with microfocus X-ray beams, which allow the investigation of very small sample volumes.

From cou.: 2 The spontaneous assembly to form ordered crystalline phases is a well-known property of colloidal particles. Common examples comprise dispersion colloids such as polymer latices, silica particles or microgels, as well as association colloids such as surfactant and polymer micelles. Of particular current interest are colloidal particles that form ordered phases in solution, i.e. in the lyotropic state, because established wet-chemical processes such as sol–gel-chemistry or polymerization reactions can be used to transform them into solid ordered materials that would otherwise be very difficult or impossible to prepare. The most prominent example is their use as templates to generate photonic crystals.

From cou.: 3 For many applications, it would be desirable to similarly assemble nanoparticles into lyotropic colloidal crystals. The formation of ordered crystalline assemblies of nanoparticles was quickly reported after synthetic methods to generate nanoparticles with sufficiently narrow size distributions had been established.1 Since then, there have been many reports of superlattice formation for different nanoparticles and also binary nanoparticle mixtures,2 mostly in the form of monolayers or micron-size crystals.3 These assemblies are mostly produced via drop casting on solid supports, or by controlled crystallization from dilute solutions.4

From cou.: 4 In most cases of ordered nanoparticle assembly, a control over the interparticle distance was neither possible nor intended. For conventional nanoparticle assemblies, some control of the interparticle distance is possible via the choice of the stabilizing surfactants that can differ in the length of their alkyl chains.5 A breakthrough has been the use of DNA-ligands by Alivisatos and Mirkin et al.,6–8 who for gold nanoparticles tailored the superlattice type and nanoparticle distance via hybridization of DNA-chains. If the DNA-chains were not hybridizing, lyotropic phases of cubic symmetry were formed. The lyotropic phase behaviour could be followed by microfocus synchrotron X-ray scattering of a small droplet of a DNA-coated gold nanoparticle aqueous solution upon drying.9,10

From cou.: 5 Since the DNA@Au system builds upon the unique and stable Au–S–DNA end group attachment and has its limitations in the amount of material that can be produced, it would be highly desirable to have more versatile and upscalable polymer@nanoparticle systems. We have recently developed a method to attach polymer chains with their chain end to nanoparticles via a ligand exchange procedure.11,12 It builds upon the advantages of state-of-the-art methods for nanoparticle synthesis such as the hot-injection technique13 to produce nanoparticles that are stabilized by short chain alkyl ligands having coordinatively binding groups such as phosphines, carboxylic acids, or amines. In the ligand exchange procedure these ligands are replaced by polymer chains having the same end groups to obtain nanoparticles coated with polymer chains, which are bound to the nanoparticle surface with their chain ends to form a spherical polymer brush. By varying the surface density and length of the polymer chains, nanoparticles with polymer layers of adjustable density and thickness can be prepared. This procedure is very versatile and can be used to coat different types of nanoparticles (Fe2O3, CdSe, PbS, ZnO, Au, Ag) with various types of polymers (polystyrene, polyisoprene, polyethylene oxide, polyethylene).12 We could show that for high surface densities, the nanoparticles are very well stabilized in solution.14

From cou.: 6 These polymer-coated nanoparticles have a well-defined core–shell structure, the core being the nanoparticle and the shell being the solvent-swollen polymer brush. This very much resembles the core–shell structure of block copolymer micelles, which have a core of insoluble polymer blocks, and a solvent-swollen shell of the soluble block. Block copolymer micelles are known to assemble into highly ordered lyotropic phases.15,16 Therefore we expected that polymer-coated nanoparticles would assemble similarly into lyotropic phases. This would open a route to well-defined nanoparticle superlattices without relying on DNA-hybridization, but rather employing conventional polymers on a larger scale, and a large range of nanoparticle types, which has not been attempted so far.

From cou.: 7 In the present study, we investigated narrow disperse maghemite nanoparticles in the size range of 6–17 nm, which were coated with polystyrene or polyisoprene of different molecular weights. We investigated their self-assembly behaviour in toluene, a good solvent for the polymers. Using small-angle X-ray scattering, we show for the first time that polymer stabilized nanoparticles can form highly ordered lyotropic phases. As for polymer micelles, fcc and bcc-lattices are formed, depending on the concentration and nanoparticle-to-layer size ratio and thus the softness of the interaction potential. By shear orientation in a shear-cell, macroscopic, highly ordered single crystals can be obtained. Additionally, shear orientation is possible for very small sample amounts (μL) by shear-alignment on lithographically patterned microfliudic grids.

After completion of the polymerization, the living end groups reacted either with acetic acid to obtain unfunctionalized polymer, with CO2 to obtain polymer with a COOH-end group, or with ethylene oxide to obtain an –OH-end group. The OH-group was activated with carbonyl diimidazol (CDI) and reacted with diethylentriamin (DETA) or pentaethylenehexamin (PEHA) to obtain amino-end functionalized polymers.11,14 Polystyrenes and polyisoprenes with COOH– and –C10H28N6-end groups were used as stabilizing ligands. The polymers were characterized by GPC, MALDI-TOF-MS, and 1H-NMR.

From cou.: 10 After their synthesis, the nanoparticles are covered with a stabilizing layer of oleic acid. The oleic acid is exchanged by a layer of end functionalized polymers via ligand exchange. In the case of iron-oxide nanoparticles, we used PS–COOH and PS–PEHA, PI–COOH, and PI–DETA. For the ligand exchange, a solution containing an excess of PS/PI-ligands (70 mg) in THF (1 mL) is added to a solution (200 μL) of nanoparticles (20 wt%) in toluene. Free oleic acid is removed by quantitative precipitation in ethanol. The solid containing nanoparticles, excess polymer and traces of low-molecular weight ligand is then redissolved in THF and again quantitatively precipitated in ethanol. After redissolution of the solid in THF, ethanol is added dropwise to selectively precipitate the nanoparticles from the supernatant containing the free polymer. The selective precipitation for the PS-nanocomposites is repeated in heptane. The amount of attached polymer was determined by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) (see ESI†).

From cou.: 12 For shear orientation of very small volumes of lyotropic phases, lithographically patterned microfluidic channel grids were used (Fig. 5). These grids consist of parallel aligned micron-sized channels with variable width and depth. They were produced by standard soft lithographic techniques from a PDMS master, which was used as a mold for NOA81 (Norland Optical Adhesive). NOA 81 is a UV-curable adhesive and more solvent-resisting than PDMS,17–19 especially to toluene. For the measurements, an amount of 2–5 μL of the sample was spread on the microstructured grid. The grid was taped with Kapton to prevent solvent evaporation.

From Soup: 92 We have found that eqn (1) describes scattering curves and scattering patterns remarkably well for a large variety of mesoscopically ordered materials. 21 The use of closed analytical functions facilitates computing and allows efficient implementation into fitting routines. It allows to quickly extract the unit cell size a , the mean deviation from the lattice points σ a , the nanoparticle radius R , its relative standard deviation σ R (polydispersity), and the mean size of the crystalline domains D from measured scattering curves and scattering patterns. Eqn (1) also reproduces correctly secondary Bragg-peaks that appear as a consequence of the finite peak width as outlined in ref. 21 .

At the lowest concentrations we observe a broad maximum at q ∼ 0.3 nm −1 indicating weak positional correlations between the nanoparticles . The minimum at q = 1.4 nm −1 corresponds to the sphere form factor minimum, from which the radius of the nanoparticles can be estimated to be 6.1 nm, in good agreement with the TEM measurements. With increasing concentration, the maximum becomes more pronounced and shifts to larger q -values. Between a concentration of 60 and 70 wt%, we observe a disorder–order transition, indicated by the sharp Lorentzian-type shape of the first-order peak and the appearance of higher order reflections.

From Soup: 96 Fig. 2 shows measured synchrotron-SAXS curves of a concentration series of Fe 2 O 3 (17 nm)@PS–N 6 (28k) nanoparticles in toluene . Since the nanoparticles are larger, we observe more form factor oscillation in the measured q -range, with the first minimum at q ∼ 0.55 nm −1 . Also for this case we did not observe shifts or damping of the form factor oscillations which would indicate nanoparticle aggregation, even at the highest concentrations and in the solid state. Since the attached polymer chains are larger, we observe the disorder–order transition at lower concentrations, i.e. between 30 and 40 wt%. Then with increasing concentration the nanoparticles first form an fcc-structure ( Fm 3 m ) and at 70 wt% they show a phase transition to a bcc structure ( Im 3 m ). For the bulk sample the bcc unit cell size is 33 nm. Also this set of scattering curves could be fit quantitatively to eqn (1) to obtain structural details of the lyotropic phases. The unit cell sizes decrease with increasing concentration from 54–45 nm for fcc, and then from 40–35 nm for the bcc-lattices. The mean deviation from the lattice points is 2.6 nm (12% relative to the unit cell size) and the domain sizes are in the range of 300–400 nm. The radius of the nanoparticles is 17.1 nm with a polydispersity of 7.5%.

From Soup: 97 Using synchrotron-SAXS we have investigated many more nanoparticle / polymer lyotropic phases at different concentrations with different nanoparticle sizes (5–17 nm) and attached polymer molecular weights (2000–28 000 g mol −1 ). The measured scattering curves are shown in Fig. 3A . Results of the fits to the scattering curves are all summarized in Table S3 in the ESI. † With increasing concentration up to the bulk nanoparticle / polymer nanocomposite we observe two typical lyotropic phase sequences DIS → FCC → BCC or DIS → BCC, depending on the nanoparticle size and attached polymer chain molecular weight.

From Soup: 98 From our investigations, we can give a schematic overview for the stability ranges for bcc- and fcc-structures, which appears to depend on the ratio of nanoparticle radius to attached polymer molecular weight. To compare the effect of different molecular weights of polystyrene and polyisoprene , we related the molecular weights to the contour lengths of the polymer chains, assuming a contour length of 0.25 nm for the monomers. The values are given in Table 2 . In Fig. 3B , we have plotted a diagram displaying the observed lyotropic phase structure as a function of nanoparticle size and polymer contour length. We observe that systems consisting of small nanoparticles (5–8 nm) with long polymer chains (18–22 nm) prefer bcc-packing, whereas larger nanoparticles (14–17 nm) with attached polymer chains in the contour length range of 7–21 nm prefer fcc-packing. For the largest nanoparticle (17 nm) with the longest polymer chains (67 nm), we observe a fcc/bcc-coexistence. In the schematic representation in Fig. 3B we observe bcc phases in the upper left and fcc in the lower right, with a coexistence region in between. The scheme in Fig. 3B is not meant as a phase diagram, but merely to display the observed trend. For large polymer chains attached to small nanoparticles , where mainly bcc-structures are observed, we have a strongly curved spherical polymer brush structure with low segment densities at the layer periphery. These would mediate very soft interactions. For shorter polymer chains attached to larger nanoparticles , we have less curved spherical polymer brush structures with dense layers and higher segment density at the periphery, which is expected to mediate harder interactions. The observation of bcc-structures for soft interacting colloids and fcc-structures for colloids with harder interactions is similarly observed for block copolymer micelles as shown by Gast. 23 In the solid state, bcc is always stable, analogous to block copolymer melts.

From Soup: 99 As for block copolymer melts or block copolymer lyotropic phases, we found it to be possible to shear-orient lyotropic nanoparticle phases to obtain for the first time macroscopically oriented single crystalline nanoparticle superlattices. Shear-orientation was performed in a plate–plate shear cell (Linkam) with a gap size of 100 μm. We found that oscillatory shear at frequencies of 1–10 s −1 and shear amplitudes of 5–10 for 10 s were suitable conditions for shear-alignment. The measured scattering patterns for different nanoparticle / polymer lyotropic phases are shown in Fig. 4 . We observe a large number (>100 in Fig. 4B ) of Bragg-reflections, indicating a high degree of lyotropic crystalline order. Indexing of these reflections is only possible by taking into account secondary Bragg-peaks which are observable as a consequence of the large peak widths typical for lyotropic crystals as outlined in ref. 24 .

From Soup: 100 For Fe 2 O 3 (5.1 nm)@PS–DETA(7.6k) ( Fig. 4A ), which was shear-oriented at 4 Hz and a shear amplitude of 9, we observe a bcc-structure oriented such that the [110]-direction is parallel to the X-ray beam and the [1 2]-direction is oriented in the shear direction. This shear-alignment structure is typical for colloidal lyotropic crystals. The alignment orients the line of highest particle density [1 2] parallel to the flow-direction and the plane of highest particle density (110) normal to the gradient direction, which is parallel to the X-ray beam. Bcc occurs in a twinned configuration. The twins both align with their [1 2]-direction in the shear direction, with the (1 2)-plane being the mirror plane that relates each of the twins. 24 The scattering pattern can be quantitatively analyzed by eqn (1) . The calculated scattering pattern is merged into the measured scattering pattern to show remarkably good agreement. The structural parameters derived from the calculation such as unit cell dimension, mean deviation from the lattice points, domain size, particle size and its mean square deviation are given in Table 3 . The nearest neighbour distance between adjacent nanoparticles is 15 nm, which is considerably larger compared to the 8.8 nm observed for the bulk phase. We observe that both twin structures occur with equal probability.

From Soup: 101 For Fe 2 O 3 (15.4 nm)@PS–DETA(7.6k) ( Fig. 4B ), which was shear-oriented at 8 Hz and an amplitude of 9, we observe a fcc-structure. It orients such that the line of highest particle density [ 10] is parallel to the flow direction and the plane of highest particle density [111] orients normal to the gradient direction, parallel to the X-ray beam. Also in this case, eqn (1) very well describes the scattering pattern. The calculated scattering pattern is merged into the measured scattering pattern to show excellent agreement. It is worth mentioning that nearly 2/3 of the more than 100 observed peaks are secondary Bragg reflections due to finite peak widths, which would usually be considered crystallographically forbidden. Also for this calculation, the structural parameters are given in Table 3 . The nearest neighbour distance is 31 nm which can be compared to the bulk value of 21 nm.

From Soup: 102 A complex and very interesting scattering pattern is shown in Fig. 4C . This scattering pattern was measured for Fe 2 O 3 (5.1 nm)@PS–DETA(3k). The sample could only be oriented by applying continuous shear at a shear rate of 750 s −1 . The pattern has similarities to the patterns observed for the bcc and fcc-structures and corresponds to a coexistence of both phases. Assuming both structures to be aligned as in Fig. 4A and B , then all peaks can be appropriately indexed and even a quantitative calculation is possible that is merged into the experimentally determined scattering pattern. It gives very good agreement and yields a relative composition fcc–bcc of 0.7 : 0.3.

From Soup: 103 An interesting point is that in coexistence there should be an epitaxial relation with respect to both the unit cell dimensions and orientations. The phase transition is believed to proceed via slight rearrangements of the particles within the unit cells via a tretragonal transition state (Bain transition) similar to the Martensitic transition in steel. If this is the case, then the 111-reflection for fcc and the 110-reflection for bcc should appear at the same position. Assuming the volume fraction ϕ is constant upon this transition, then the unit cell dimensions should be related as a fcc = 2 1/3 a bcc ≈ 1.26 a bcc , which is experimentally well fulfilled as a fcc / a bcc = 17/14 = 1.22 (see Table 3 ).

From Soup: 105 For shear orientation in conventional shear cells (Couette, Searle, plate–plate), at least 1–5 mL of the sample is usually required, which is often more than can be produced when dealing with valuable materials such as nanoparticles , proteins or DNA. This motivated us to prepare micro sample holders which allowed shear orientation of very small amounts of gel-like samples. In an analogous fashion to the production of microchannels for microfluidic chips, we used soft lithography to prepare sample holders with linear arrays of 1 cm × 1 cm patches, each consisting of 10–100 parallel aligned microchannels with diameters between 10 and 100 μm and a depth of 300 μm.

By spreading a gel-like sample into a microchannel patch, the shear force orients the liquid crystalline structure. For the microstructured channel device shown in Fig. 5 , only 2–5 μL of the sample is needed. The microchannel patch can be sealed with conventional Kapton tape to avoid solvent evaporation .

From Soup: 107 We show that polymer -coated nanoparticles can form liquid crystalline lyotropic phases with high order very similar to micellar lyotropic liquid crystals of surfactants and polymers . We observe the formation of bcc and fcc phases with a trend that small nanoparticle /large polymer systems form bcc-structures, and large nanoparticle /small polymer systems form fcc-structures. This appears to be a consequence of the softness of the polymer layers and the segment density at the periphery of the layer and is very similar to observations of block copolymer micelles in solution and bulk. Within the ordered phases, the distance between adjacent nanoparticles can be varied systematically via concentration and attached polymer molecular weights in a range of 10–40 nm. It is possible to shear-orient the nanoparticle lyotropic phases to obtain for the first time macroscopically oriented highly ordered nanoparticle superlattice single crystals. In addition, we present microstructured sample holders that allow shear orientation and investigations of very small sample amounts (μL) of lyotropic phases.
