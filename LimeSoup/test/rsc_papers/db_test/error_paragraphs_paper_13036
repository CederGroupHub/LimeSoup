From cou.: 1 A solventless, multi-element, steady-state optimization system is presented. The device uses three parallel conduits that contain solid NbF5 and SnBr4 as well as a low wattage tungsten filament loaded with Pb to deliver dry vapors to an ICP. These are used to create a steady-state signal containing the following ions that can be used for tuning: 28Si+, 79Br+, 120Sn+, 184W+, and 208Pb+. In comparison to using a nebulizer for optimization, the dry plasma optimization produced an average enhancement of 4.5(±0.4)-fold for 26 elements when using electrothermal vaporization sample introduction.

From cou.: 2 A steady-state signal facilitates the tuning of an ICP-MS and, as a consequence, a nebulizer is usually employed. It also is relatively easy to use and routinely available with most ICP-MS systems. However, it has been shown that water in the central channel does have a large impact on how the plasma behaves.1 Consequently, for those techniques where a dry plasma is employed in analysis, e.g., electrothermal vaporization (ETV), laser ablation (LA), etc., “tuning” with a nebulizer and a water saturated vapor in the central channel is less than optimum. Laser ablation produces a nearly steady-state signal that can be used for tuning, but ETV yields a low duty cycle, transient signal that can make its use in plasma and spectrometer tuning extremely tedious.

From cou.: 3 Most optimization techniques, including recommendations by the manufacturer, generally utilize a single mass or very small mass range, making detection of mass biased sensitivities difficult to optimize. Introducing a dry sample that is steady-state for the purposes of plasma tuning has been explored, albeit still tuning on a single element: Fe introduced as a metal carbonyl;1 Ar2 from the plasma gas;2 Mo and Re from the resistive heating of wire filaments;4 Mn from a Nafion® membrane desolvated aerosol,3 and heated bulk Ag.5 While these were useful, a wider range of masses and physical characteristics (e.g., ionization potential, volatility) should permit better selection of optimized settings.

From cou.: 4 This paper explores a steady-state, dry sample introduction system employing several elements representing a range of masses and ionization potentials. This broader tuning base will be particularly useful where the dry sample introduction source is transient in character and not easily amenable to “tuning” the plasma and optics. Our particular interest is in optimization for ETV introduction. A comparison of ETV-ICP-MS performance using dry plasma optimization and wet plasma (e.g., nebulizer introduction) will also be investigated.

From cou.: 7 For the instrument used in this study and possibly in other systems, an applied power of 1.2 kW without a water load causes a secondary discharge to form beyond the sampling cone, i.e., in the last skimmer region of the ion optics for this particular system. While the exact nature of the discharge is still not understood,7–9 a substantial current flows from the skimmer cone to ground (0.1–0.5 mA). The discharge also causes a marked decrease in the signal intensity and can lead to erosion of the second skimmer cone.10 It was found that a reduction of the applied power from 1.2 kW to 0.7 kW minimizes or eliminates the discharge while maximizing the sensitivity for dry plasma conditions.9,10 In brief, this need for reduced power operation with dry sample introduction further supports the requirement for optimization in the absence of solvent.

From cou.: 8 Optimization of a multi-dimensional system can be performed in a myriad of ways ranging from Simplex optimization to Monte Carlo annealing. However, many approaches, such as the two noted, would require all 21 parameters, as seen on Table 1, of the instrument to be entered manually, intensities measured and then a new set of 21 parameters entered and repeated until an optimized parameter set is found. This is a very time consuming method and does not utilize the already available software that permits certain parameters to be manually scanned with continuous signal recording. To minimize the time required for the optimization, a simple algorithm was developed that uses the existing software to provide results as quickly as the data are collected.

In our case, the instrument was reasonably tuned so no unique weighting was given to a particular mass region and the following algorithm was employed:

From Soup: 31 It should be stressed that the response algorithm used for optimization can be structured to reflect the analyst’s tuning objectives. For example, if one wished to optimize the sensitivity of the heavy elements, all masses could be used but W m / z for heavier masses could be made disproportionately large. Thus, small changes in the intensity of the larger m / z calibrants would show a favorable change in R even when accompanied by an intensity loss for the low mass ions.

From Soup: 32 The voltage of the electron multiplier ( i.e. , gain) was optimized initially to minimize mass bias 11 and was only checked at the outset of the optimization procedure. The nebulizer gas flow was then optimized, and this value used during the dry plasma optimization.

From Soup: 33 The remaining parameters were optimized, one at a time, starting with gas flows and torch position, then starting with the optics closest to the torch and moving back toward the analyzer. This order addressed factors affecting sensitivity first and peak shape last. This process was performed three times sequentially for dry and wet optimization techniques to compensate for interdependencies of the various parameters. The results of the optimizations are summarized on Table 1 .

Thus, small changes in the intensity of the larger m/z calibrants would show a favorable change in R even when accompanied by an intensity loss for the low mass ions.
From Soup: 36 The ideal material for the dry calibrator has many attributes that must be considered: solid, easily obtained, low toxicity and compatible with the ICP-MS system. Although vapor pressures for most solids are not in the literature, these pressures can be easily determined from thermodynamic data. 12,13 To find useful materials, the required vapor pressure was estimated from signals obtained from a typical ETV experiment. Assuming that 1 ng of sample yielding a signal approximately 1 s in duration and a gas flow rate of 1.2 L min −1 (20 mL s −1 ), the ideal gas equation yields a local partial pressure of ca. 10 −3 Pa.

From a list of ca. 100 candidates, NbF 5 , TiBr 4 and SnBr 4 were isolated and then experimentally evaluated by placing a small amount of the salt into a stainless steel column between plugs of glass wool.

From Soup: 38 NbF 5 produced no measurable signal for Nb + , and detectable signals from 19 F + , SiF + and Si + were seen in the mass spectrum. TiBr 4 yielded no detectable Ti + signal although Br + was quite pronounced. This may be the result of hydrolysis of TiBr 4 by trace water in the system and the subsequent formation of low volatility TiO 2 and release of HBr. SnBr 4 produced large signals for all the isotopes of both Sn + and Br + .

From Soup: 39 Thus, elemental ions with m / z in the areas of 19 (F + ), 79 (Br + ) and 118 (Sn + ) were available. To obtain a high mass ion, low temperature heating of Pb placed on a filament from a 300 W projection bulb was employed. The filament was first electroplated with copper to aid in the wetting of the filament by Pb. A shard of lead ( ca. 4 mg) was placed on the filament and heated under N 2 until the Pb melted onto the filament. In operation, the current to the filament was adjusted to give a reasonable 208 Pb + signal, ca. 6 W. Interestingly, W + was also observed, probably as a result of volatile WO 2 forming in trace amounts on the filament surface. In the end, the final ions and their respective first ionization potentials (in eV) include: F + (17.42), Si + (8.15), SiF + , Br + (11.84), Sn + (7.34) and Pb + (7.42).

From Soup: 40 A schematic of the dry calibrator is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The halide salts were loaded into separate columns, and gas flow through each column were controlled via needle valves. The Pb signal required a balance between flow rates and filament current to achieve the desired signal. A metered bypass line (second line from the bottom in Fig. 1 ) permitted adjustment of the total central channel flow to a predetermined value once the flows for the individual elements were adjusted.

For the particular instrument used in this study and using the response function noted earlier, Table 1 summarizes the optimized settings using both nebulizer introduction and the dry calibrator. The first eight parameters and torch position most strongly affect the signal intensity. The remaining factors are considered to be peak shaping settings. 14 The mass resolution of the instrument is large (1000–2000) and fine tuning this parameter beyond the original settings was not considered in the optimization procedure.

From Soup: 51 A summary of the enhancements for several analytes using eqn (2) is shown in Fig. 2 . The average enhancement for all of the elements shown in the figure is 4.5 ± 0.4; and in no instance was a loss in intensity observed as a result of using the dry calibrator to optimize the analytical conditions of the plasma or analyzer system. The Sn and W were included in the suite of elements in Fig. 2 to demonstrate that the tuning masses were not enhanced to a greater extent than other masses.

From Soup: 52 Si suffers from a significant 28 N 2 background signal because of entrained atmospheric gasses and the HNO 3 matrix as well as 28 CO. The other isotopes of Si are much less abundant and also suffer from polyatomic interferences, e.g. , 29 CO and 30 NO. However, the dry optimized parameter set was able to produce a Si + signal that was greater than the background while the Si + signal with the wet plasma was indistinguishable from the background. This prevented calculations of an enhancement factor for Si. Br was also monitored with the ETV firing but failed to produce a significant signal using either parameter set. This was probably caused by the volatilization of HBr and loss during the 300 °C heating step before data collection had begun. The nearly element independent enhancement indicates that the dry optimization served to better sample the plasma and focus the resulting ion stream in the ion optics region. This may be a result of the physical changes in the plasma ( e.g. plasma pulling back into the torch) at lower applied powers and no solvent load. By sampling the plasma more efficiently, all of the ions signals were enhanced without bias toward specific properties such as mass or ionization potential.
