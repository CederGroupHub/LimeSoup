From cou.: 1 Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is becoming a rapid and easy technique for quantitative elemental analysis. However, the implementation of accurate quantitative LIBS analysis is always subject to noise interference. In this work, in order to improve LIBS analysis performance for trace elements in aluminium alloys, a modified trade-off soft and hard threshold method is proposed based on the wavelet theory, where optimal parameters are deduced to eliminate noise interference. By using the modified algorithm combined with an Al I line at 308.215 nm as an internal standard, the statistical parameters including the determination coefficient (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE) and the relative standard deviation (RSD) of magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn) and cuprum (Cu) in aluminium alloys are all significantly improved. The most significant improvement of R2 is 0.066 for Cu. The maximum RMSE reduction value is 0.583 for Mg, and the mean value of RMSE reduction is 0.261 for all three trace elements. And after de-noising, the value of RSD gets smaller for each trace element. Such results indicate that the optimized algorithm is valid for the effective improvement of the accuracy of quantitative LIBS analysis in the trace element determination of aluminium alloys.

From cou.: 2 As a powerful and promising analytical technique, laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has become a popular method for quantitative elemental analysis. The past two decades have seen the fast development of LIBS, which has the advantages of easy operation, rapid detection, and simultaneous multi-element analysis.1–4 Furthermore, LIBS has been applied in various areas, such as environmental monitoring,5,6 geological analysis,7–9 material processing control,10 the pharmaceutical industry,11 space exploration12 and so on. However, although it is simple for users to collect emission spectra from a sample, there are quite a few limitations deteriorating the performance of LIBS spectrum detection, for example, the poor quality of the LIBS spectrum which would decrease the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the LIBS spectrum, noise can be generated from bremsstrahlung radiation and ionizing radiation. According to the previous studies by Mermet et al.,13,14 noise can be roughly divided into four categories: the source noise resulting from the laser–sample or laser–plasma interaction, the shot noise corresponding to the number of photons arriving at the detector, the thermal drift noise, and the detector noise. However, in the signal processing of this study, the noises are described by a single parameter of white noise accounting for all kinds of noise sources, and the white noise is a random signal with equal intensity at different frequencies.

From cou.: 3 Peak intensities in emission spectra are directly proportional to element concentrations. Although it is feasible to minimize the white noise by improving the performance of firmware theoretically, such as by using an optimal optical camera15 as well as a fast discharge energy and high voltage,16 it is virtually impossible to make all the experimental settings optimal. Therefore, as a result of the white noise involved in the obtained LIBS spectra, the quantitative LIBS analysis should become less persuasive.17 To obtain a better merit of LIBS analysis performance, it is indispensable to find a solution to reduce or eliminate the LIBS noise and extract useful signals during data pre-processing to the greatest degree.

From cou.: 4 In this work, we proposed a new wavelet threshold de-noising algorithm with a modified trade-off soft and hard threshold method to reduce the white noise in LIBS spectra in order to improve the accuracy of quantitative LIBS analysis. This de-noising algorithm evolves from the previous studies based on the theory of wavelet transform (WT).18,19 WT is a signal decomposition method and has been favoured as an extremely powerful analysis tool by researchers. Wiens et al. have used the WT method to remove the LIBS noise and got a satisfactory de-noising effect.20Via adopting a modified wavelet algorithm multiplied by a scaling factor, Zhang et al. have successfully improved the accuracy of LIBS quantitative analysis21 and proposed a new double threshold method for noise suppression,22 demonstrating its validity and importance as an alternative to the de-noising method. In fact, the threshold method has been widely used now as one of the various wavelet de-noising methods. This is because the threshold method not only can efficiently suppress noise, but also can well preserve and reflect the peak point characteristic of the original signal. However, the previous wavelet threshold algorithm failed to find an optimal threshold function and decomposition level for data processing compared to the modified one in this work. In this paper, we demonstrate that this modified de-noising algorithm can easily determine the threshold and effectively eliminate the white noise, as well as reduce the error of prediction. To prove the new method, the algorithm is used to analyze aluminium alloy samples to certify the effectiveness of the algorithm, and to improve the LIBS for quantitative analysis.

From cou.: 5 WT is a crucial transform analysis method that inherently originates from the short time Fourier transform method and has achieved rapid development in the past two decades. WT is characteristic of time-frequency analysis23 and multi-resolution analysis as a method of processing weak signals. It has the capability to denote local signal features in the time and frequency domains,24–26 where a variable time-frequency localization analysis with a fixed window size is used. The shapes of the fixed window, time window and frequency window are variable in the wavelet transform process. Usually, a higher frequency resolution and lower temporal resolution at low-frequency signal parts, or a higher time resolution and lower frequency resolution at high-frequency signal parts, are considered for detecting and analysing transient, anomaly, complex and non-stationary signals and for demonstrating their components. Thus, WT is known as an analytical signal microscope. Wavelet noise filtering is a crucial application of WT. Related research on background correction and de-noising in the past few years has proved its better performance than other analytical techniques.27–29 Yuan et al. adopted WT to subtract background for LIBS application utilizing wavelet coefficients.30 Schlenke et al. successfully achieved noise suppression and signal preservation using stationary WT.31 Zou et al. implemented a modified algorithm for background removal based on WT and significantly improved the accuracy in the quantitative analysis.32 In any L2(R) space (the square and integrable space), each raw spectral signal f(t) can be expanded as described by the following equations:where ψu,s(ψ) is the wavelet function at a particular scale s; u represents the translation factor; s represents the dilation factor; W(u,s) is the wavelet coefficient, and f(t) is the given signal function to be analysed. In the present work, the proposed algorithm, with two paramount parameters (i.e. the decomposition level (DL) and adjustment parameter (α)), is used for low content element analysis in aluminium alloys. However, in order to acquire optimized values for both parameters, we set up a criterion (i.e. wavelet entropy) acting as the reference to estimate the quality of the original data. Entropy plays a central role in information theory as a measure of information, choice and uncertainty.33 To continue, we use entropy to describe the variation degrees of noise complexity with the DL, and if the noise signal exhibits less confusion, the value of entropy is less, and vice versa. Therefore, the introduction of entropy here, which was first defined by Claude E. Shannon, is used for the information quantity measurement.34 Entropy corresponds to the states of disorder, confusion and disorganization. Entropy is an evaluation parameter for information measurement of a positioning system at a certain state, and can be used to estimate the complexity of random signals. To continue, in noise filtering processing, it is generally believed that the original signal and the noise signal are independent of each other, and the entropy of white noise can be quantified by using wavelet coefficients. According to the maximal entropy principle of information theory, the weaker the original signal and the noise signal correlation is, the greater the entropy. If the WT coefficient matrix is regarded as a probabilistic distribution sequence, the entropy calculated reflects the extent of the wavelet coefficient matrix, namely the disorder degree of signal probability distribution, which is called wavelet entropy.35 As a consequence, wavelet entropy mirrors the nature of the original information entropy.

From cou.: 6 In 1995, Donoho proposed a threshold method based on WT.36 The basic idea is that when the wavelet coefficient Wu,s is smaller than a critical threshold, Wu,s will be considered to be mainly caused by noise at that time and ought to be abandoned; while in the case of Wu,s greater than the critical threshold, the wavelet coefficient is thought to be mainly generated by a signal and should be directly preserved (hard threshold method) or shrunk by a certain fixed amount to zero (soft threshold method). Finally, the de-noised signal is reconstructed with new wavelet coefficients. And the formulas of the hard and soft threshold methods are as follows.where λ is the critical threshold, sgn is the step function, Wu,s is the wavelet coefficient obtained in Section 2.1, and Ŵu,s is the de-noised wavelet coefficient.

From cou.: 7 Although hard threshold and soft threshold methods have been widely used with expected results, there are still some inherent drawbacks that need to be overcome. For the soft threshold method, there is an invariably constant deviation in Wu,s and Ŵu,s, which directly affects the approximation of both the reconstructed signal and real signal; the hard threshold method is better than the soft threshold method in terms of the mean square error. Nevertheless, an additional oscillation can always rise in the estimated signal, leading to poorer smoothness than the original signal.

From Soup: 21 In addition, this high-order threshold function can also help to facilitate varieties of mathematical treatments. As mentioned in Section 2.1, two parameters are needed to be calculated prior to data processing.

From Soup: 22 At first, the Shannon entropy of white noise and wavelet entropy are calculated by using wavelet coefficients. Then, the gap between the white noise and the noisy LIBS signal is described by the entropy ratio (ER), and the ER shows a sudden increase in the optimal DL around, because the significant increase of ER can be caused by the rapid separation between the clean LIBS signal and the white noise under the optimal DL. Moreover, the slopes between the neighbouring ER are used to describe the effect of ER increase; the changes of the slopes describe the rate of the ER increase, and the most significant change of the slopes means the maximum rate of ER increase. With this, we can get the optimal DL. 21

From Soup: 24 In this study, the apparatus used in LIBS measurements is as follows. Briefly, a Litron laser (wavelength: 1064 mm, pulse repetition: 5 Hz, pulse energy: 100 mJ) was used to emit a laser beam, which was focused onto the surface of the aluminium alloy through a convex lens with a focal length of 15 cm. The plasma emission was collected by a light collector and transmitted to the entrance of the LTB 200 spectrometer through an optical fiber. The type of spectrometer used in this experiment is echelle (wavelength 200–840 nm, resolution: λ /Δ λ = 9000). At the exit of the focal plane of the spectrometer, an intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) detector was coupled, whose delay time and gate width were set at 1.0 and 100 μs, respectively. In addition, 15 laser shots were accumulated at the same site on the sample surface in order to reduce the effect of laser energy fluctuation and statistical errors, and then one LIBS spectrum was obtained.

From Soup: 27 Step 1: the wavelet function Daubechies 4 (db4) was selected to translate each raw spectral signal into a host of levels of wavelet decomposition. At each particular scale, the corresponding wavelet coefficients indicate how close is the wavelet function to the original signal.
 ###### 
From cou.: 28 As mentioned above, there are four groups of spectral data for each sample. These spectra were processed by the following procedures:
From Soup: 28 Step 2: as an indicator, wavelet entropy was introduced for evaluating the information quantity of the spectral signal, and hence the optimal DL was calculated by utilizing wavelet entropy.

From cou.: 29 Step 1: the wavelet function Daubechies 4 (db4) was selected to translate each raw spectral signal into a host of levels of wavelet decomposition. At each particular scale, the corresponding wavelet coefficients indicate how close is the wavelet function to the original signal.
From Soup: 29 Step 3: after obtaining the DL, according to the modified trade-off soft and hard threshold method, the optimal α was calculated based on the maximum entropy principle.
 ###### 
From cou.: 30 Step 2: as an indicator, wavelet entropy was introduced for evaluating the information quantity of the spectral signal, and hence the optimal DL was calculated by utilizing wavelet entropy.
From Soup: 30 Step 4: the most paramount step is the removal of white noise. Specifically, the white noise was removed by applying the optimal DL and α obtained from previous step 2 and step 3, and then the de-noised spectral data were obtained by reverse transformation of the wavelet.
 ###### 
From cou.: 31 Step 3: after obtaining the DL, according to the modified trade-off soft and hard threshold method, the optimal α was calculated based on the maximum entropy principle.
From Soup: 31 Step 5: the search for characteristic peaks was then executed for the target elements. In addition, the original peaks and de-noised peaks were fitted using the Gaussian or Lorentzian fitting function with the help of the IGOR software. The alternative reason of using the Gaussian or Lorentzian is that the Lorentzian curve fits performs better the spectrum of slow fading out to the edges while the Gaussian curve fits performs well the spectrum falling off more sharply. According to the study of the actual spectra, the elements Mg and Cu are fitted well by the Gaussian fitting function, and the Mn is fitted well by the Lorentzian function in this paper. The typical characteristic spectral lines of target elements are shown in Fig. 1 . The spectral lines are clear with high intensities over an acceptable background, illustrating that their concentrations are above the LIBS detection limits. However, much white noise can also be readily observed, which will deteriorate the quantitative LIBS measurement.
 ###### 
From cou.: 32 Step 4: the most paramount step is the removal of white noise. Specifically, the white noise was removed by applying the optimal DL and α obtained from previous step 2 and step 3, and then the de-noised spectral data were obtained by reverse transformation of the wavelet.
From Soup: 32 Step 6: the matrix effect caused by the physical and chemical properties of the sample components should affect the laser–matter interaction, leading to a deteriorated result in the quantitative LIBS measurement. To minimize the matrix effect, the internal standard was always used in the linear calibration with appropriate reference samples of similar matrix compositions. Therefore, an aluminium atomic line at 308.215 nm was selected as the ideal internal standard in this work. Then step 5 was repeated for the aluminium line at 308.215 nm.
 ###### 
From cou.: 33 Step 5: the search for characteristic peaks was then executed for the target elements. In addition, the original peaks and de-noised peaks were fitted using the Gaussian or Lorentzian fitting function with the help of the IGOR software. The alternative reason of using the Gaussian or Lorentzian is that the Lorentzian curve fits performs better the spectrum of slow fading out to the edges while the Gaussian curve fits performs well the spectrum falling off more sharply. According to the study of the actual spectra, the elements Mg and Cu are fitted well by the Gaussian fitting function, and the Mn is fitted well by the Lorentzian function in this paper. The typical characteristic spectral lines of target elements are shown in Fig. 1. The spectral lines are clear with high intensities over an acceptable background, illustrating that their concentrations are above the LIBS detection limits. However, much white noise can also be readily observed, which will deteriorate the quantitative LIBS measurement.
From Soup: 33 Step 7: the last step is to estimate the performance of the new algorithm. Three parameters were selected to verify the effectiveness of the wavelet threshold de-noising method. They were the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) of the curve, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the fitted peak area intensities, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the peak area. Consequently, these three parameters were calculated for both the raw and de-noised spectral signals.
 ###### 
From cou.: 34 Step 6: the matrix effect caused by the physical and chemical properties of the sample components should affect the laser–matter interaction, leading to a deteriorated result in the quantitative LIBS measurement. To minimize the matrix effect, the internal standard was always used in the linear calibration with appropriate reference samples of similar matrix compositions. Therefore, an aluminium atomic line at 308.215 nm was selected as the ideal internal standard in this work. Then step 5 was repeated for the aluminium line at 308.215 nm.
From Soup: 34 The performance of the quantitative analysis serves as an indicator to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm. According to the study of the actual spectra, the analyte lines of Mg II 280.271 nm, Mg I 383.829 nm, Mn II 293.931 nm, Mn I 403.076 nm and Cu I 324.754 nm were chosen to demonstrate how effectively the modified de-noising algorithm influences the R 2 , RMSE and RSD. Since at higher concentrations, self-absorption is no longer negligible for resonance lines, and the Mg, Mn, and Cu content is relatively low in the Al alloy, the lines of Mg II 280.271 nm, Mn I 403.076 nm and Cu I 324.754 nm were chosen for LIBS quantitative analysis in this work. This is in agreement with the method of Mohamed 15 and Sabsabi. 37,38 The selected elemental wavelengths and excitation energies are listed in Table 2 . And the raw and de-noised spectra are displayed in Fig. 2 . It clearly shows that the spectrum became more smooth after being treated by this algorithm, which makes it possible to get an accurately fitted area by Lorentz or Gaussian profiles.
 ###### 
From cou.: 35 Step 7: the last step is to estimate the performance of the new algorithm. Three parameters were selected to verify the effectiveness of the wavelet threshold de-noising method. They were the coefficient of determination (R2) of the curve, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the fitted peak area intensities, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the peak area. Consequently, these three parameters were calculated for both the raw and de-noised spectral signals.
From Soup: 35 As reported in the previous study, the R 2 , which is a paramount parameter in calibration curve construction, can give us initial knowledge concerning the prediction ability of the model and reflect how close is the fitted curve to the actual data. Thus, the correlation of the data is briefly introduced in this section. In aluminium alloy standard samples, all elements except Al are at low concentrations. In addition, there is too much white noise in the spectra. Thus most of the characteristic spectral lines of elements are submerged under noise. For example, as shown in Table 1 , the Mg content in the A425C sample is less than 0.1%, and therefore, it is hard to analyse the spectral line of Mg I 383.8292 nm and Mn II 293.931 nm, and so does for the Mn element in the A426C sample and the Cu element in A421C and A425C samples. A linear regression model is then created with the fitted peak areas by the Gaussian or Lorentzian function, and R 2 is calculated. The corresponding calibration curves treated respectively using the hard threshold, soft threshold, modified trade-off soft and hard threshold methods are shown in Table 3 . It can be observed from Table 3 that the modified trade-off soft and hard threshold method developed in this paper shows a better effect on the actual signal de-noising, and R 2 has a significant improvement over the traditional de-noising method, because larger R 2 values were obtained by the modified trade-off method. However, the result of the Mg II 280.271 nm line turns out to be a bad fit for both raw and de-noised signals, with an R 2 of 0.739, 0.726, 0.735 and 0.749, respectively. This result is expected due to the high signal to noise ratio since WT is suggested to be preferably good at processing weak signals. Therefore, for the spectral lines with low signal to noise ratios, the performance of this de-noising algorithm should be significantly better. This expectation was further supported by the spectral lines of Cu I 324.754 nm, Mn II 293.931 nm and Mn I 403.076 with the most significant improvement of R 2 0.066. As can be seen from Fig. 2 , the apparent SNRs of Cu and Mn elements are lower than those of Mg lines, but they exhibit a better de-noising effect. Moreover, the R 2 of Mg I 383.829 nm increases significantly compared to that of Mg II 280.271 nm. From comparison of the results obtained from these models, R 2 from the de-noised spectrum models is found to be better than that obtained from the original models. This points out that the results of peak fitting indicate that the linearity of the de-noised models is better than that of the original one.
 ###### 
From cou.: 36 The performance of the quantitative analysis serves as an indicator to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm. According to the study of the actual spectra, the analyte lines of Mg II 280.271 nm, Mg I 383.829 nm, Mn II 293.931 nm, Mn I 403.076 nm and Cu I 324.754 nm were chosen to demonstrate how effectively the modified de-noising algorithm influences the R2, RMSE and RSD. Since at higher concentrations, self-absorption is no longer negligible for resonance lines, and the Mg, Mn, and Cu content is relatively low in the Al alloy, the lines of Mg II 280.271 nm, Mn I 403.076 nm and Cu I 324.754 nm were chosen for LIBS quantitative analysis in this work. This is in agreement with the method of Mohamed15 and Sabsabi.37,38 The selected elemental wavelengths and excitation energies are listed in Table 2. And the raw and de-noised spectra are displayed in Fig. 2. It clearly shows that the spectrum became more smooth after being treated by this algorithm, which makes it possible to get an accurately fitted area by Lorentz or Gaussian profiles.
From Soup: 36 Although an improvement in R 2 was obtained after being treated by the algorithm, there is still an abnormal phenomenon that the fitted peak area values obtained from the de-noised spectra by WT slightly increased in a few samples. This abnormally increased peak area may be explained by the algorithm itself. The wavelet threshold de-noising method, according to the theory of the algorithm, can eliminate the white noise in the spectrum, and thus the algorithm would affect the intensity of the characteristic spectral lines of the elements. Compared with the normal peak areas, it's easy to identify the cause of the slightly increased abnormal peak area. When there are minor peaks at very close wavelengths adjacent to the characteristic peak, they could be integrated into the major one during the arithmetic processing, leading to an increased value of the peak area for the elemental characteristic lines. Nevertheless, we can eliminate the false area by adjusting the threshold value and an excellent noise filtering effect was obtained for the improvement of the R 2 value.
 ###### 
From cou.: 37 As reported in the previous study, the R2, which is a paramount parameter in calibration curve construction, can give us initial knowledge concerning the prediction ability of the model and reflect how close is the fitted curve to the actual data. Thus, the correlation of the data is briefly introduced in this section. In aluminium alloy standard samples, all elements except Al are at low concentrations. In addition, there is too much white noise in the spectra. Thus most of the characteristic spectral lines of elements are submerged under noise. For example, as shown in Table 1, the Mg content in the A425C sample is less than 0.1%, and therefore, it is hard to analyse the spectral line of Mg I 383.8292 nm and Mn II 293.931 nm, and so does for the Mn element in the A426C sample and the Cu element in A421C and A425C samples. A linear regression model is then created with the fitted peak areas by the Gaussian or Lorentzian function, and R2 is calculated. The corresponding calibration curves treated respectively using the hard threshold, soft threshold, modified trade-off soft and hard threshold methods are shown in Table 3. It can be observed from Table 3 that the modified trade-off soft and hard threshold method developed in this paper shows a better effect on the actual signal de-noising, and R2 has a significant improvement over the traditional de-noising method, because larger R2 values were obtained by the modified trade-off method.

This points out that the results of peak fitting indicate that the linearity of the de-noised models is better than that of the original one.
From Soup: 37 To further verify the effectiveness of this modified algorithm, another factor, the error of prediction is involved in this work. In Section 5.1, we have built a quantitative model to predict the value of concentration. With the quantitative model, we also attempted to define a figure of merit as strong evidence. In order to estimate the accuracy of this algorithm, RMSE and RSD are adopted as the criteria to evaluate the accuracy and precision between the predicted value and the actual one of the peak area. At first, the value given by instrumental measurements and de-noising processing is defined as the prediction value. The specific formula of RMSE is as follows: where y i is the prediction value, and in this paper, in order to compare the values of bias, both peak areas (whether de-noised or not de-noised) are predicted; ŷ i is the reference one, namely the actual value, which represents the mean value of four measurements for each sample. n is the number of samples. After implementing this procedure, all those detailed RMSE values are summarized in Fig. 3 .

From Soup: 44 According to the calculated RMSE and RSD, the error of prediction becomes smaller after de-noising. The results show that all RSD values decrease after de-noising and the maximum RMSE reduction value is 0.583, and the mean value of RMSE reduction is 0.261, which indicate that the de-noising algorithm can improve the accuracy of this linear regression model. Clearly, there is almost no difference in RMSE and RSD for Mg II 280.271 with or without being treated by the algorithm, which in turn demonstrates that this modified algorithm is good only at processing weak signals. Consequently, from the results obtained with Mg, Mn, and Cu, we can demonstrate that the modified trade-off soft and hard threshold method would improve the accuracy of quantitative LIBS analysis with reduced RMSE and RSD.

From Soup: 45 As mentioned earlier in Section 5.1, the loss of sensitivity in quantitative LIBS analysis could be expected due to the interaction between the laser and matter. In LIBS technology, there is another imperfection that cannot be completely eliminated by this modified trade-off soft and hard threshold algorithm, i.e. the matrix effect. All LIBS analyses are subject to the matrix effect, which would result in deviations in the calibration graph. The matrix means that non-analyte components related to the physical and chemical properties of a sample would affect the laser interaction, and this phenomenon is called the matrix effect. 39,40 However, the internal standard calibration method can minimize the matrix effect using appropriate internal matter characterized by a similar matrix composition. 41–43 The most abundant element in the sample should be set as the internal standard to reduce the error of matrix effect fluctuation in the LIBS experiment in theory.

From Soup: 46 In this paper, an Al I line at 308.215 nm was used as the internal standard. The emission intensities of each element, i.e. Mg, Mn, and Cu, were normalized to Al I 308.215 nm. Fig. 4 shows the results comparing the corresponding calibration curves with and without Al I 308.215 nm as an internal standard.

Fig. 4 shows the results comparing the corresponding calibration curves with and without Al I 308.215 nm as an internal standard.
From Soup: 47 When aluminum was used as an internal standard, there was an obvious improvement of the determination coefficient, which means that this method improved the calibration graph linearity and the processed fitted curve was much more close to the actual data by eliminating the matrix effect fluctuation. For example, the response curve appears to be more linear ( R 2 = 0.969) for the Mn line at 403.076 nm when using the internal standard, in comparison with the less linear response curve ( R 2 = 0.851) without the internal standard. In addition, the weak response curve of Mg II 280.271 nm ( R 2 = 0.739), it also obtains better linearity ( R 2 = 0.821) with internal standards. The improvement is expected as a result of matrix effect elimination. In our LIBS experiment, although the aluminum line at 396.152 nm is supposed to be the best internal line, it was noted that the line has obvious self-absorption. In addition, we have compared multiple aluminum lines, and the line at 308.215 nm is the most ideal one for use as the internal standard. These results proved that this method really had a better linear relationship and showed the best sensitivity with accuracy improvement in quantitative LIBS analysis.

From Soup: 48 In order to verify the effectiveness of this modified algorithm, leave-one-out cross validation has been adopted in a similar procedure of noise filtering processing. A sensible criterion could be provided for model comparison by leave-one-out cross validation. The detailed data are summarized in Table 5 . Compared with spectra without de-noising and the internal standard, it is clearly observed that an improvement for Mg, Mn, and Cu is obtained with smaller RMSECV. Therefore, this approach allows for the determination of the concentration of trace elements in low SNRs. Therefore, this modified algorithm indeed improves the accuracy of quantitative LIBS measurement.

From Soup: 49 In this paper, a modified trade-off soft and hard threshold method is introduced. Calibration curves are constructed with and without this modified algorithm, which could effectively eliminate the white noise and improve the linearity. In addition, compared with the hard threshold and soft threshold methods, the modified trade-off soft and hard method can further optimize the results. The method does not need to distinguish the type of noise and has been shown to successfully improve the linearity of calibration curves, as well as the information quantity of spectra by diminishing the white noise existing in LIBS spectra. Furthermore, the R 2 , RMSE and RSD of Mg, Mn, and Cu obtained have been significantly improved with higher R 2 , lower RMSE and better RSD. The parallel results of Mg II 280.271 nm indicate that the modified algorithm based on WT is good at processing weak signals, which means that the algorithm can be used to analyse trace elements. Furthermore, the loss of sensitivity in quantitative LIBS analysis can be significantly eliminated by using the Al I 308.215 nm as an internal standard for calibration. Combining the modified algorithm with the internal standard method, we could effectively improve the accuracy of LIBS quantitative analysis for trace elements. In addition, this algorithm took less time through computer simulation and may be used for practical work. Accordingly, the modified trade-off soft and hard threshold method can be used in LIBS spectra analysis as a powerful preprocessing tool.
