From Soup: 0 Welcome to this issue of CrystEngComm dedicated to the use of crystal engineering in the design of new materials. The properties of materials are governed by the relative positions and orientations of the components of the material. Just as the properties of liquid crystals are controlled by the relative organisation of the individual molecules in the liquid crystalline phase, or as the properties of solid-state inorganic materials are controlled by the relative positions of the atoms or ions, so in molecular solids the properties of the material are equally governed by the relative organisation of the molecules, or even polymers, that comprise the crystalline solid. This topic lies at the heart of crystal engineering, the ability to control and even design the organisation of molecular species in the solid-state. Through applying the principles of crystal engineering we can attempt to control the materials properties of the compounds we prepare.

From Soup: 1 This issue of CrystEngComm brings together articles which describe the preparation of materials that exploit crystal engineering approaches to target specific properties. Whether designing porous frameworks via coordination bonds or hydrogen-bonds or controlling the magnetism in a molecular array, ultimately crystal engineering brings its influence to bear on the properties of the material. The articles brought together here provide valuable insight into how we may begin to specifically design solid-state structures and to ultimately reach the goal of fine tuning the properties of solid-state materials.
