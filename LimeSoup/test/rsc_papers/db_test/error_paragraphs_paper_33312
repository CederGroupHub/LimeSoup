From cou.: 1 The unexpected ferroelectric properties of nanoscale hafnia-zirconia are considered to be promising for a wealth of applications including ferroelectric memory, field effect transistors, and energy-related applications. However, the reason why the unexpected ferroelectric Pca21 phase can be stabilized has not been clearly understood although numerous extensive theoretical and experimental results have been reported recently. The ferroelectric orthorhombic phase is not a stable phase under processing conditions from the viewpoint of bulk free energy. Although the possibility of stabilization of the ferroelectric phase due to the surface energy effect has been theoretically suggested, such a theoretical model has not been systematically compared with actual experimental results. In this study, the experimental observations on polymorphism in nanoscale HfO2–ZrO2 solid solution thin films of a wide range of film compositions and thicknesses are comprehensively related to the theoretical predictions based on a thermodynamic surface energy model. The theoretical model can semi-quantitatively explain the experimental results on the phase-evolution, but there were non-negligible discrepancies between the two results. To understand these discrepancies, various factors such as the film stress, the role of a TiN capping layer, and the kinetics of crystallization are systematically studied. This work also reports on the evolution of electrical properties of the film, i.e. dielectric, ferroelectric, anti-ferroelectric, and morphotropic phase changes, as a function of the film composition and thickness. The in-depth analyses of the phase change are expected to provide an important guideline for subsequent studies.

From cou.: 2 The properties of nanoscale materials are different from those of bulk materials in many cases.1–4 This difference generally results from the different crystallographic phases in nanoscale materials from those in bulk materials, and it is generally related to the large surface to volume ratio.1–4 The total free energy of a certain material is the sum of the bulk free energy and the surface (or the interface and grain boundary for heterogeneous and polycrystalline materials) energy.1–4 Therefore, with a significant grain size decrease, metastable phases with a low surface energy can be stabilized.1–4 In 2011, feasible ferroelectric properties were first reported from doped HfO2,5 which is supposed to be a high-k dielectric layer. Although the origin of such an unexpected emergence of ferroelectric properties was not clearly elucidated in the original report,5 it is believed that a new polar orthorhombic phase (o-phase, space group: Pca21, no. 29) is involved,6,7 and many similar reports have been published on the pure8 or doped-HfO29–18 (or unintentionally doped HfO219), Hf1−xZrxO2 (HZO, x = 0.0–1.0),20–24 and even ZrO225,26 films.27 In fact, this polar phase was first reported in Mg-doped ZrO2 films in 1998, but its ferroelectricity was not examined at that time.28 The polymorphs of HfO2 and ZrO2 were systematically examined by Navrotsky and Pitcher et al. based on thermodynamic free energy.29,30 It has been reported that the new ferroelectric phase can be utilized for 1T-1C ferroelectric random-access-memory (FeRAM), 1T ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET) and negative capacitance field-effect-transistor (NCFET) applications.31–33 Moreover, the phase transition involved in the ferroelectric o-phase has been reported to be promising for energy storage, energy harvesting, and electrocaloric cooling.34–39 The stable phase of the bulk HfO2 and ZrO2 is the monoclinic phase (m-phase, space group: P21/c, no. 14), and no polar phase can be observed in the phase diagram of the bulk HfO2 and ZrO2.40,41 On increasing the temperature, tetragonal (t-phase, space group: P42/nmc, no. 137) and cubic phases (c-phase, space group: Fmm, no. 225) can be stabilized, while two nonpolar orthorhombic phases (space groups: Pbca, no. 61 and Pnma, no. 62) can be formed with increasing hydrostatic compressive pressure for both HfO2 and ZrO2.40,41 Therefore, the emergence of the unexpected polar phase must be attributed to other factors than the bulk properties. In 2015, Materlik et al. first suggested that the o-phase can be stabilized due to the surface energy effect based on their comprehensive first principles calculations.42 According to their report, the surface energy of the t-phase was much lower than that of the m-phase, whereas the bulk free energy of the t-phase was higher than that of the m-phase, which is consistent with the experimental results for bulk-phase materials.42 The bulk and the surface free energies of the o-phase were in between those of the t- and m-phases.42 As a result, within certain thickness and grain size ranges, thermodynamic stabilization of the o-phase could be understood based on the surface (or grain boundary) energy model.42 The theory for the stabilization of the t-phase in ZrO2 thin films or nanoscale crystallite due to the surface energy effect has already been known to explain the experimental observations within thin films and nanoscale crystallites.43–46 The surface energy was calculated using computational methods and has been useful in predicting and explaining relatively unusual experiments.47–49 However, the surface energy of the o-phase had not been considered before Materlik et al.'s work.42 Due to the availability of critical information on the o-phase, it is now feasible to compare the experimentally acquired results to the theoretically predicted phase evolution behaviours of HZO-based ferroelectric films. However, possible discrepancies between the actual experimental results and the surface energy model should still be quantitatively examined. Since the precise grain size distribution from the experiment was not available for Materlik et al.'s theoretical calculations,42 the grain size was assumed to be a fixed value. However, because almost all polycrystalline materials have a certain grain size distribution, which must have a crucial impact on the phase evolution, such effects need to be considered.

From cou.: 3 In this paper, therefore, the experimental data (grain size distribution, phase evolution and ferroelectric properties) for Hf1−xZrxO2 thin films of various compositions (x = 0, 0.19, 0.43, 0.70, and 1.00) and thicknesses (9.2, 14.2, 19.2, 24.2, and 29.2 nm) are carefully examined and compared with the theoretical expectation based on the previous computational calculation for the same material system by Materlik et al.42 Most of the experimental data were taken from Park's dissertation,50 while the thermodynamically stable phases were calculated based on the thermodynamic surface energy model in Materlik et al.'s paper.42 The actual grain size distribution was extracted from plane-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images using the computational software Gwyddion.51 The calculated grain size distribution was used to calculate the expected relative fractions of the t-, o-, and m-phases in the film. The verification of the crystalline phases in ferroelectric doped HfO2 films was done by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies,6,7 but the well-known difficulty in discerning the diffraction peaks from the three phases in general X-ray analysis renders quantitative verification difficult.6,21 Therefore, experimental phase identification is mostly based on the assessment of the dielectric properties, e.g. the measurement of the polarization hysteresis. Especially, the differences between the theoretically expected polymorphism and the experimentally observed electrical properties are systematically compared, and the possible origins of such differences are carefully discussed.

From cou.: 4 HZO films were deposited on a Si substrate coated with a TiN electrode using thermal ALD at a wafer temperature of 280 °C. Hf[N(C2H5)CH3]4, Zr[N(C2H5)CH3]4, and ozone were used as the Hf precursor, Zr precursor, and oxygen source, respectively. 50 nm-thick TiN films were deposited onto the thermally oxidized Si substrate and used as the bottom electrode. HZO films with various Hf/(Hf + Zr) ratios were prepared by controlling the ALD cycle ratios of HfO2 and ZrO2, with almost identical growth rates of HfO2 and ZrO2 (∼0.12 nm per cycle on the TiN electrode). For scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, the HZO films were annealed without the TiN capping electrode (post-deposition-annealing: PDA). However, it was confirmed that the presence of TiN capping layers during annealing did not significantly alter the grain size distribution.

From cou.: 5 For electrical characterization, Pt (60 nm)/TiN (20 nm) top electrodes were deposited using a shadow mask and RF magnetron sputtering. After the top electrode deposition, post metallization annealing (PMA) was performed at 500 °C under a N2 atmosphere for 30 s using a rapid thermal annealing process. The composition and thickness of HZO films were examined using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (Quant'X, Thermo Scientific) and ellipsometry (L-116d, Gaertner), respectively. Since the film thickness of HZO films could not be directly measured on the TiN bottom electrode, the linear relationship between the areal atomic density and film thickness of HZO films on the Pt electrode and the Si substrate was first verified. From the linear relationship, the thickness of HZO films could be estimated from the layer density measured using XRF. It was confirmed that the thickness estimated from the layer density is consistent with the thickness from cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in our previous studies.19,34,35,52 Polarization–voltage and capacitance–voltage characteristics were measured using a ferroelectric tester (TF analyzer 2000, Aixacct Systems) and an impedance analyser (4194A, HP) at a frequency of 1 and 10 kHz, respectively. The AC voltage amplitude used for capacitance–voltage characterization was 50 mV. The microstructure of the films was analysed using field emission SEM (SU70, Hitachi, or S4800, Hitachi). For crystal structural analysis, a grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) analysis was conducted using an X-ray diffractometer (X'Pert Pro, Panalytical) equipped with a Cu Kα X-ray source. For GIXRD measurements, the incidence angle was fixed at 0.5°, and a 2θ scan was conducted. A grain size distribution analysis was conducted using the watershed method implemented in the Gwyddion software.

From cou.: 6 In this section the model proposed in ref. 42 will be briefly reviewed. As previously mentioned, Materlik et al.42 suggested that the stabilization of the metastable ferroelectric phase can be understood based on the surface energy effect. According to their model, the free energy of each phase in grains can be calculated based on the bulk free energy, surface energy, lateral dimensions of grains, and film thickness. From experiments columnar grains that span the whole film thickness are expected in doped HfO2 thin films.7 For the sake of convenience, cylindrical-shaped grains with identical size were assumed. Then, the free energy of a grain with lateral radius r and film thickness t was calculated using eqn (1):where Ggrain, Gbulk, γif and γgb are the free energy per unit volume of the grain, the free energy per unit volume of the bulk, the interface energy (the metal/oxide interface in the metal–HfO2–metal capacitor structure) and the grain boundary energy, respectively. These parameters are dependent on the film composition, and can be calculated from values reported for HfO2, Hf0.5Zr0.5O2, and ZrO2 based on Vegard's law. In ref. 42 the γif and γgb values were assumed to be identical to the surface energy, which could be problematic. This hypothesis arises from the calculation based on the nanoscale crystallites, sandwiched between the top and bottom electrodes rather than the grains in polycrystalline films. Hence, reasonable assumptions for the interface energy and grain boundary energy are required to calculate the free energy of crystalline phases in polycrystalline thin films. This will be discussed in more detail in sections 3 and 4.

From cou.: 7 From eqn (1), the total free energies of each phase for a specific size of the grains can be easily calculated under the given hypothesis. According to ref. 42, Gbulk of the m-phase was the lowest whereas that of the t-phase was the highest. In the case of the surface energy (γs), the values of the t-phase were the lowest whereas the m-phase showed the highest values. The Gbulk and γs of the o-phase are in between those of the m- and t-phases. Therefore, the stable phase changes from the m-phase in the bulk to the t-phase when the grain size is decreased, but the o-phase can be stabilized within a certain range of grain size during the transition between the m- and t-phases. Accordingly, the critical grain radius (rcrit,x−y) where the total free energy of x- and y-phases is equivalent (x and y can be the t-, o-, or m-phases) can be calculated using eqn (2).

From Soup: 18 Fig. 1 shows the polarization–electric field ( P – E ) curves of HfO 2 , Hf 0.81 Zr 0.19 O 2 , Hf 0.57 Zr 0.43 O 2 , Hf 0.30 Zr 0.70 O 2 , and ZrO 2 films of various thicknesses (9.2, 14.2, 19.2, 24.2, and 29.2 nm) sandwiched between a Pt/TiN top electrode (where the TiN layer is in contact with the dielectric layer) and a TiN bottom electrode. The P – E characteristics were taken from the dissertation by Park. 50 All the samples used for the electrical characterization were annealed at 500 °C under a N 2 atmosphere for 30 s (post metallization annealing, PMA) after the formation of the top electrode. The fabrication processes of capacitors are explained in detail in the Experimental section. The variation in the P – E curves with the cation composition of 9.2 nm-thick HZO films was almost identical to the results previously reported by Müller et al. ; 20 the Hf 0.57 Zr 0.43 O 2 films with a thickness of 9.2 nm show a robust ferroelectricity with a doubled remanent polarization (2 P r ) of 33 μC cm −2 . The 2 P r value decreases with increasing Zr or Hf contents. On increasing the Hf-concentration, the 2 P r value monotonically decreases, while the films with higher Zr-concentration show antiferroelectric-like properties before they become linearly dielectric for pure ZrO 2 . For 9.2 nm-thick ZrO 2 films it is believed that an even higher electric field would be required to induce the ferroelectric o-phase. However, such a high electric field could not be applied since the breakdown field is lower. It seems that the electric field required for the transition to the o-phase decreases with increasing film thickness for pure ZrO 2 due to the surface energy effect. While a previous report by Müller et al. 20 did not report on the thickness effect, Fig. 1 clearly reveals that the film thickness plays a role as important as composition for the occurrence of ferroelectricity. For the Hf 0.57 Zr 0.43 O 2 films, 2 P r remains almost constant when the thickness of the film is below 20 nm, but decreases rapidly when the thickness is above 25 nm. Other films with slightly higher or lower Zr-concentration show similar variations with thickness. The variation of the dielectric constant ε r with thickness and composition was examined by capacitance–voltage ( C – V ) analysis, and the dielectric constant–electric field ( ε r – E ) curves are included in Fig. S1 of the ESI. † The changes in the ε r – E characteristics matched well with the changes in P – E characteristics.

From Soup: 20 Fig. 2 shows the plane-view SEM images of HZO films with various x -values of film composition and film thicknesses which were also taken from the dissertation by Park. 50 It can be noticed from Fig. 2 that the grain size distribution is composition dependent. Especially for the films thicker than 19.2 nm, the grain sizes of higher Hf-concentration films were larger than those of higher Zr-concentration films. The grain size distribution was examined for the HZO films using the software Gwyddion. 51 Fig. 3a–e show the grain size distribution of HZO films when x is 0.00, 0.19, 0.43, 0.70, and 1.00, respectively. It should be noted that the grain size analysis was conducted on the SEM images from PDA samples instead of PMA samples. To confirm the effects of the TiN capping layer on the grain sizes and their distributions, the grain size distributions of ∼9.1 nm-thick Hf 0.48 Zr 0.52 O 2 films annealed with PMA and PDA were compared after removing the TiN capping layer by a wet etching process. It could be concluded that the effect of the upper TiN capping layer on the grain size distribution was negligible. The plane-view SEM images and the grain size distribution of PMA and PDA Hf 0.48 Zr 0.52 O 2 thin films are given in Fig. S2 in the ESI. † It is known that the grain size estimated from SEM images can be different from the crystallographic grain size which can be extracted from TEM investigations. However, for HZO thin films, it was confirmed that the grain size from SEM images is similar to that from TEM in a previous study. 19 The median grain size increases with increasing film thickness when x = 0.00, 0.19, and 0.43, whereas it remains almost constant when x = 0.70 and 1.00. On varying the thickness of HZO films with x = 0.70 and 1.00, there are slight differences in the grain size distribution, but the median grain size does not increase with increasing film thickness.

From cou.: 21 Fig. 2 shows the plane-view SEM images of HZO films with various x-values of film composition and film thicknesses which were also taken from the dissertation by Park.50 It can be noticed from Fig. 2 that the grain size distribution is composition dependent. Especially for the films thicker than 19.2 nm, the grain sizes of higher Hf-concentration films were larger than those of higher Zr-concentration films. The grain size distribution was examined for the HZO films using the software Gwyddion.51Fig. 3a–e show the grain size distribution of HZO films when x is 0.00, 0.19, 0.43, 0.70, and 1.00, respectively. It should be noted that the grain size analysis was conducted on the SEM images from PDA samples instead of PMA samples. To confirm the effects of the TiN capping layer on the grain sizes and their distributions, the grain size distributions of ∼9.1 nm-thick Hf0.48Zr0.52O2 films annealed with PMA and PDA were compared after removing the TiN capping layer by a wet etching process. It could be concluded that the effect of the upper TiN capping layer on the grain size distribution was negligible. The plane-view SEM images and the grain size distribution of PMA and PDA Hf0.48Zr0.52O2 thin films are given in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† It is known that the grain size estimated from SEM images can be different from the crystallographic grain size which can be extracted from TEM investigations.

From Soup: 21 The difference in thickness dependence of grain size distributions is believed to be related to the different crystallization behaviours. It is well known that the crystallization temperature of HfO 2 is higher than that of ZrO 2 , and in thin films it is also affected by the film thickness. 53 Therefore, the GIXRD patterns of H 1− x Zr x O 2 films after the film deposition (black curves) and those after the PMA (red curves) were compared. Fig. 4a–e show the GIXRD patterns of HZO films with x = 0.00, 0.19, 0.43, 0.70, and 1.00, respectively, analysed before and after the PMA. As expected from the crystallization temperature of HfO 2 and ZrO 2 , the in situ crystallization during the ALD process was enhanced with increasing x value when the film thickness is fixed. On increasing the film thickness, the in situ crystallization also increased, which also well matches with the general trend of these thin films. 53 For the quantitative comparison, the degree of crystallization in the as-deposited state was estimated by semi-quantitative comparison of the GIXRD patterns before and after PMA. For that purpose, the diffraction patterns within a 2 θ range of 27–33 degrees were taken. The area of the diffraction peak from the 111 and −111 planes of the m-phase and that from the 111 plane of the o-phase or the 011 plane of the t-phase were calculated and the results are summed up. Although the precise identification of the XRD peaks from these thin films is regarded as challenging since a precise and detailed assignment of each peak is still unavailable, this approach is generally accepted in the community. The total area of the aforementioned diffraction peaks calculated from the GIXRD patterns before PMA was divided by that after PMA. While such analysis cannot give a quantitative estimation of the crystallinity of the as-deposited film, this can be taken as a useful assessment of the relative degree of crystallization of the as-deposited film. The resulting degree of crystallinity is plotted as a surface map in Fig. 4f , revealing that the crystallinity of the as-deposited films increases with increasing x value and film thickness. In fact, the GIXRD pattern of the as-deposited ZrO 2 film was almost identical to that of the film after PMA. Therefore, the different grain size distributions for the Hf-rich and Zr-rich films shown in Fig. 2 and 3 can be understood as follows. For the Hf-rich film, the as-deposited films are mostly amorphous, and thus crystallization was induced by the PMA, which resulted in the rather broad and non-uniform distribution of the grain size. Consequently, the ferroelectric properties of the HfO 2 thin films become further degraded in thicker films. In contrast, for the Zr-rich film, the as-deposited film already contains a rather high fraction of crystalline phase which may play the role of uniform crystalline nucleation and growth sites of the remaining amorphous material during the PMA. The initially uniform crystalline seeds induced a uniform grain size distribution, which has an important implication for the film performance.

It is well known that the crystallization temperature of HfO2 is higher than that of ZrO2, and in thin films it is also affected by the film thickness.53 Therefore, the GIXRD patterns of H1−xZrxO2 films after the film deposition (black curves) and those after the PMA (red curves) were compared.

From Soup: 22 Fig. 5a shows the three dimensional surface plot of 2 P r values taken from the P – E curves in Fig. 1 (after PMA). It is important to compare the data with the evolution of the crystallographic phases. This electrical performance map could be compared with the theoretically estimated phase change, especially the o-phase, shown in Fig. 5b , where the o-phase fraction was calculated based on the aforementioned thermodynamic model using the grain size distribution shown in Fig. 3 . The phase evolution could have been alternatively examined by using GIXRD patterns as conducted in a previous study. 21 However, this method was not adopted because determining lattice parameters of HZO films with various Zr-concentrations using GIXRD is a challenging task. The composition dependence of lattice parameters of the crystalline phases and the effect of film stress, which also has a non-negligible influence, cannot be accurately considered in such an analysis. 21 Nonetheless, Schenk examined the stress in Si-doped HfO 2 film using the sin 2 Ψ method, and 1.5–2 GPa of tensile stress could be measured. 54 However, such detailed X-ray analyses were not attempted in this work. Fig. 5b shows a three dimensional surface plot of the relative o-phase fractions in HZO films with x = 0.0, 0.19, 0.43, 0.70, and 1.00 at 300 K. It was assumed that the plane-view image of a 9 nm thick sample processed under similar conditions to those given in ref. 19 mimics the results of the 9.2 nm films investigated here, since their deposition processes were identical. Changes in the relative fractions of all the m-, o- and t-phases in HZO films with various Zr contents are plotted in Fig. S3 of the ESI. † It was assumed that the difference in the grain size distribution between HfO 2 and ZrO 2 is negligible in films with 9.2 nm thickness after PMA.

From Soup: 23 Two significant differences between the experimental 2 P r values and the theoretically calculated o-phase fractions could be noticed when comparing Fig. 5a and b . First, the composition and film thickness at which the 2 P r value is the highest in Fig. 5a and that where the o-phase fraction is the highest in Fig. 5b are different. The experimental 2 P r value was the largest at Hf 0.57 Zr 0.43 O 2 composition for all film thicknesses, whereas from the theoretical estimation, the Hf 0.30 Zr 0.70 O 2 film is expected to have the highest o-phase fraction when the film thickness is thicker than 14.2 nm. It seems that this discrepancy is related to the in situ crystallization during the ALD process which has already been presented in Fig. 4 and the related text. Second, the critical thickness at which 2 P r abruptly decreases is quite different from the critical thickness at which the o-phase fraction is reduced. The experimental 2 P r value of the 19.2 nm-thick Hf 0.57 Zr 0.43 O 2 film is 29.5 μC cm −2 , which rapidly decreases with increasing thickness above 24.2 nm. From the theoretical expectation, however, the o-phase fraction of the 9.2 nm-thick Hf 0.57 Zr 0.43 O 2 film is as high as 88%, and drastically decreases to 41% only when the film thickness increases to 14.2 nm. This result implies that in actual experiments, the m-phase formation in Hf 0.57 Zr 0.43 O 2 films is much more deterred than theoretically expected at a given thickness.

From Soup: 24 It should be noted that Fig. 5b was plotted based on the assumption that ‘ γ gb = γ if = γ s ’ which was the first suggestion in the original paper on the surface energy model. 42 It is, however, known that the γ gb of high-angle (between the two crystallographic orientations of the involved grains) incoherent grain boundaries is approximately 1/3 of γ s . 55 Schenk examined the texture of Si-doped HfO 2 films in his dissertation, and no strong preferred orientation could be found. 54 Therefore, the assumption of a high angle grain boundary, where the orientation difference between two adjacent grains is larger than 15 degrees, is believed to be reasonable. From eqn (2) , it can be noticed that the critical lateral grain size is proportional to γ gb . Therefore, the assumption that ‘ γ gb = 1/3 γ s ’ will significantly decrease the resulting critical lateral grain size, implying that the results for the relative fraction of the t- and o-phase should also decrease. Fig. 5c shows a similar plot of the o-phase fraction with the assumption that ‘ γ gb = 1/3 γ s ’, showing a significantly decreased relative o-phase portion compared to Fig. 5b . Nonetheless, the emergence of the highest fraction of the o-phase at x ∼ 0.7 is still evident even under this assumption for the calculation.

 ###### 
From cou.: 26 Stress in thin films.
From Soup: 26 To understand the aforementioned discrepancies between the experimental results and the expectation from the thermodynamic surface energy model, various factors should be considered. Among them, film stress from various sources must be heavily considered. Park et al. examined in detail the effect of film strain on the ferroelectric properties of Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 thin films. 23 They used the 111 peak position of the o-phase of their GIXRD spectra as a strain gauge, and suggested that about 1.5% tensile strain is required to induce the o-phase from the t-phase. 21,23 Shiraishi et al. examined the effects of the coefficient of thermal expansion on the o-phase formation and concluded that a large tensile stress is favourable for the o-phase formation whereas it is unfavorable for the m-phase formation. 56 Schenk examined the film stress in Si-doped HfO 2 thin films using the sin 2 Ψ method. The estimated film stress ( σ film ) was approximately 1.5–2 GPa. 54 When the similar mechanical properties of HfO 2 and ZrO 2 are considered, the film strain in an HZO film should also be similar to that of a Si-doped HfO 2 thin film. Based on their theoretical calculations 42 reported, the bulk modulus ( K ) of the t-, o-, and m-phase for Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 was found to be 210 GPa, 224 GPa and 185 GPa, respectively. Young's modulus ( Y ) can be calculated from K and the Poisson's ratio ν according to the equation Y = 3 K (1 − 2 ν ). For fluorite-structured ceramic materials it is a reasonable assumption to set ν equal to 0.3 for all phases. 57 Then the Y of the t-, o-, and m-phases can be calculated as 252 GPa, 269 GPa and 222 GPa. With these results, the elastic strain energy ( E elastic ) in the thin film can be calculated using:

 ###### 
From cou.: 29 Effect of upper TiN capping layers.
From Soup: 29 In previous studies, upper TiN capping layers were reported to strongly affect the evolution of polymorphism of doped HfO 2 thin films. 5,9 Mueller et al. suggested that the TiN capping layer prevents the shear strain which induces the phase transformation from the t- to m-phase during cooling. 9 It was also suggested that the upper TiN capping layer prevents the surface diffusion, and the subsequent grain growth and accompanying transformation to the m-phase can be suppressed. 27 Toriumi et al. examined the effect of the Si upper capping layer on the kinetics of the phase transition from a metastable tetragonal or cubic phase to the monoclinic phase. 58 They reported that the Si upper capping layer significantly increased the activation energy for a monoclinic phase formation, so the Si capping layer could kinetically suppress the monoclinic phase formation. 58 Based on the aforementioned reports, it is believed that the TiN capping layer is also expected to affect the kinetic energy barrier for the monoclinic phase formation. Thus, the effect of the TiN capping layer (the top electrode, in this case) must be taken into consideration because the HZO films were annealed at 773 K with the TiN top electrode being deposited.

From Soup: 30 To understand the effect of the TiN capping layer, the crystallization process at 773 K and subsequent cooling down to 300 K need to be understood. According to previous studies, the crystalline phase formed during the crystallization annealing process is most probably the t-phase before cooling down, whereas large grains are still in an m-phase. But at this temperature almost no o-phase is present, which was confirmed by high temperature XRD studies. 9 Such a stabilization of the t-phase at high temperature can be understood from the entropy effect ( G = H − TS , where G , H , and S are the Gibb's free energy, enthalpy, and entropy, respectively). Due to its higher entropy compared to those of the m- and o-phases, the t-phase can be stabilized during crystallization annealing at 773 K within a very wide grain size region. 42 During cooling down to room temperature, however, the entropy effect becomes mitigated and the t-phase should be partially transformed to the m-phase or o-phase. In fact, the data shown in Fig. 5c correspond to the situation where, besides the bulk and grain boundary energies, no other constraints on the phase evolution are involved during cooling down after PMA. This may not be the case in the actual experiment.

From Soup: 31 The influence of the TiN capping layer on the phase evolution is considered to be as follows. First, the grain size distributions at 773 K for the samples at all compositions are assumed to be identical to Fig. 3 . This assumption may be slightly incorrect due to the fact that the TiN capping would suppress the grain growth by suppressing the surface diffusion. However, it was assumed that the grain growth during cooling down after annealing process is negligible. According to the thermodynamic data at 773 K the phase distribution under each condition can be calculated. Accordingly, the films are expected to be composed of mostly m- and t-phases at 773 K. During cooling down, relatively large t-phase grains can (partially) transform to the o- or m-phase, whereas sufficiently small grains still exist in t-phase even at 300 K. The critical grain radius range for such phase transitions can be calculated based on the surface energy model. However, the TiN capping can suppress the transformation from the t-phase to the m-phase. Therefore, the fraction of grains that are supposed to be in the m-phase are now assumed to be in the o-phase. Only the amount of the m-phase formed at 773 K was considered to remain after cooling down to 300 K. Fig. 5d shows the o-phase fraction calculated according to this procedure. The changes in the relative fractions of the m-, o- and t-phases in HZO films with various Zr contents based on the assumptions ‘ γ gb = 1/3 γ s ’ and the described TiN capping effect are plotted in Fig. S5 of the ESI. † While the o-phase fraction is significantly increased compared to the results of Fig. 5c , the maximum of the o-phase fraction is still observed at a composition x of about 0.7. Therefore, the effect of the TiN capping cannot fully explain the experimental results.

 ###### 
From cou.: 33 Influence of partial crystallization of as-deposited films.
From Soup: 33 The theoretical estimation of the phase evolution shown in Fig. 5b actually corresponds to a circumstance where an initially uniform amorphous material is crystallized to a polycrystalline material with different grain size distributions and accordingly different phases. However, this is certainly different from what actually is happening during the experiment. As can be understood from the GIXRD patterns of the as-deposited films, the Zr-rich films are already significantly crystallized, and Hf-rich films also have a certain crystallinity but a lower degree of crystallization compared to the Zr-rich films. In detail, the in situ crystallization of the ALD films is quite different from the aforementioned crystallization during PMA, because in situ crystallization is mainly induced by the two-dimensional migration of adsorbing atoms on the film surface. 59 In contrast, the crystallization by PMA proceeds via the classical solid-state phase transition. The complicated surface reactions between the adsorbing chemicals (the metal precursor, the oxygen source, the film surface during steady-state growth, or the substrate during initial nucleation) also largely influence the in situ crystallization. 60 Nonetheless, when the deposited film is partially crystalline, the evolution of the crystalline phase from the remaining amorphous material should be affected by the already crystallized fraction. It is highly probable that the crystallization of the amorphous part of the as-deposited film proceeds via the heterogeneous nucleation and growth from the already-present crystalline part. Their size is expected to be much smaller than the estimated grain size after the PMA ( Fig. 2 and 3 ). Under these circumstances, the identification of the crystalline phase of the as-deposited film is critically important since it will influence the final crystallization phases. However, to precisely identify such small crystalline phases using GIXRD (even when a synchrotron X-ray source is applied) is extremely challenging. 27 Therefore, the aforementioned theoretical prediction is revisited. For this purpose, first the grain size must be determined. Fortunately this can be accomplished using the detailed XRD pattern.

From cou.: 34 The theoretical estimation of the phase evolution shown in Fig. 5b actually corresponds to a circumstance where an initially uniform amorphous material is crystallized to a polycrystalline material with different grain size distributions and accordingly different phases. However, this is certainly different from what actually is happening during the experiment. As can be understood from the GIXRD patterns of the as-deposited films, the Zr-rich films are already significantly crystallized, and Hf-rich films also have a certain crystallinity but a lower degree of crystallization compared to the Zr-rich films.

From Soup: 34 From Fig. 4f , the degrees of crystallization of the 9.2 nm-thick Hf 0.57 Zr 0.43 O 2 and Hf 0.30 Zr 0.70 O 2 films were 11 and 23%, and the values for 19.2 nm-thick films were 84 and 88%, respectively. Therefore, the 9.2 nm-thick films were considered to be partially crystalline films, and their GIXRD patterns were used to analyse the crystallization process. For the as-deposited 9.2 nm-thick Hf 0.57 Zr 0.43 O 2 , Hf 0.30 Zr 0.70 O 2 , and ZrO 2 films, weak and broad o111/t101 peaks can be observed in Fig. 4c–e . The broadening of the diffraction peaks can be related to the small size of the crystallites, and the Scherrer equation can be used to estimate the crystallite size. 61 To precisely estimate the peak broadening effect from small crystallites, the broadening from other factors needs to be excluded. For this purpose, the broadening of a diffraction peak of single crystalline MgO and Si substrates was measured, and the broadening of the substrate peak (the full width at half maximum, FWHM, is 0.07°) turned out to be less than 5%, compared to that of the o111/t101 diffraction peak of HZO ( x = 0.43, 0.70, and 1.00) films with a FWHM in the range of 1.8 to 2.4°. Thus, the broadening from other effects than the size can be ignored. By applying the Scherrer equation, the crystallite sizes of the as-deposited 9.2 nm-thick Hf 0.57 Zr 0.43 O 2 , Hf 0.30 Zr 0.70 O 2 , and ZrO 2 films were estimated to be in the range of 3.5 to 4.5 nm. No trend was observed for the variation of the Zr-concentration. The calculations are in fair agreement with those from previous studies. 62–64 Although the degree of crystallization of as-deposited films was different for films with different Zr-concentrations, the crystallite size turned out to be almost identical. These crystallites in the as-deposited film have an effect on the evolution of the polymorphism in the annealed HZO films.

From Soup: 35 Another parameter necessary for calculating the total free energy is the γ if between crystallites and the amorphous matrix. It is difficult to estimate this value precisely. However, as in the case of γ gb , it will be slightly smaller than γ s . Therefore, to roughly estimate the γ if effect, γ if was assumed to be in the range from 1/3 γ s to 1/2 γ s . 55,65 With the assumption that the shape of the crystallites is spherical, the relative Gibbs free energy Δ G of the tetragonal and orthorhombic crystallites can be calculated by setting the free energy of the monoclinic crystallite to zero. Fig. 6a and b show the calculated results with the assumption of γ if = 1/3 γ s and γ if = 1/2 γ s , respectively. As can be readily expected, the negative Δ G values in Fig. 6a and b show that the orthorhombic and tetragonal crystallites are more stable than the monoclinic ones. Interestingly, for both cases, the stability of the t-phase increases with increasing Zr-concentration. However, close to a Zr-concentration of 50% the o-phase shows higher stability. This is certainly in contradiction to the theoretical estimation shown in Fig. 5c which was built based on the grain size extracted from the films after PMA. From Fig. 5c , the most stable phase for a Zr-concentration close to 50% was the m-phase and that for a Zr-concentration around 70% was the o-phase. In Fig. 6 the o-phase appears to be more stable around 50% and the t-phase is more stable around 70%. These o- and t-phases present in the as-deposited film retain their crystalline structure after the PMA and, furthermore, play the role of a heterogeneous nucleation site for the subsequent crystallization of the remaining amorphous material during the PMA. This result is consistent with the achieved electrical properties from the annealed 9.2 nm-thick films: a Hf 0.57 Zr 0.43 O 2 film was ferroelectric while annealed Hf 0.30 Zr 0.70 O 2 and ZrO 2 films were antiferroelectric-like or even dielectric.

From cou.: 36 Another parameter necessary for calculating the total free energy is the γif between crystallites and the amorphous matrix. It is difficult to estimate this value precisely. However, as in the case of γgb, it will be slightly smaller than γs. Therefore, to roughly estimate the γif effect, γif was assumed to be in the range from 1/3γs to 1/2γs.55,65 With the assumption that the shape of the crystallites is spherical, the relative Gibbs free energy ΔG of the tetragonal and orthorhombic crystallites can be calculated by setting the free energy of the monoclinic crystallite to zero.

From Soup: 36 Finally, the difficulties of the emergence of ferroelectricity in undoped HfO 2 and ZrO 2 are discussed within the context of previous discussions. For HfO 2 thin films, the crystallite radius range for the o-phase formation is 0.8–1.3 and 0.5–0.8 nm with the assumption of γ if = 0.5 γ s and γ if = 0.33 γ s , respectively. Being even smaller than 3 unit cells, these values are unreasonably small compared to the previous experimental reports. 62–64 Bohra et al. reported that the nuclei of HfO 2 thin films had cylindrical shape with a diameter of 5 nm and a thickness of 2 nm in a 2 nm-thick HfO 2 thin film. 62 To the authors’ knowledge this is the smallest grain size reported so far. In the classical crystallization theory, there is a critical size of the crystallite below which the temporarily formed crystalline embryos disappear since the decrease in bulk free energy due to crystallization is lower than the increased interfacial energy. 65 It was assumed that the critical grain size of HfO 2 is larger than the size required for the o-phase formation. However, this does not necessarily mean that inducing ferroelectricity in undoped HfO 2 is impossible. Polakowski et al. reported the emergence of ferroelectricity in undoped HfO 2 films deposited by ALD. 8 In that report, it was suggested that the ferroelectricity could be induced by the surface energy effect, but they took the surface energy as the grain boundary energy, which surely overestimated the grain boundary effect. 42 Kim et al. could induce ferroelectric properties in nominally undoped HfO 2 thin films by decreasing the deposition temperature of the ALD process. However, they observed increased impurity such as C and N in their films. 19 The role of such impurities in HfO 2 thin films has not yet been clearly understood. Nonetheless, Xu et al. reported that N doping can induce ferroelectricity in HfO 2 thin films. 17 These reports show that the o-phase can be formed in nominally undoped HfO 2 , but it cannot be understood solely as a size effect. Pal et al. reported that decreasing the ozone dose time for the HfO 2 ALD process could increase the oxygen vacancy concentration and also increase the P r value of the undoped 8 nm-thick HfO 2 film, and this result matched well with the previous computational calculation results. 66 Consequently, it is believed that ferroelectricity can be induced in undoped HfO 2 , but it might need additional factors other than the size effect.

From Soup: 37 For ZrO 2 thin films, no crystallite radius range for the o-phase stabilization is expected, suggesting that the orthorhombic crystallite is very difficult to form due to the interface energy effect alone. This might be due to the large bulk free energy difference between the o- and t-phases that has to be overcome solely by the interface energy effect. Therefore, to induce ferroelectric properties in pure ZrO 2 thin films, factors other than the size effect will be required. Fan et al. reported the emergence of a temporary ferroelectric property in 111-textured ZrO 2 thin films, but it disappeared when the electric field increased above a certain critical value. 25 In that paper, they suggested that compressive strain along the <11−2> direction can temporarily stabilize the o-phase. 25 Lin et al. also reported that in situ annealed ALD ZrO 2 thin films on a Pt electrode could show ferroelectricity. 67 Starschich et al. reported the strong ferroelectric properties in undoped 100–400 nm-thick ZrO 2 films when the films were prepared by a chemical solution deposition (CSD) method. 26 In their CSD films, however, the P r value in the pristine state was low and repetitive wake-up field cycling was required to achieve a feasible ferroelectric performance. 26 This trend is different from that in the report by Fan et al. , suggesting that the o-phase formation in ZrO 2 thin films remains unexplained. 25 From a thermodynamic point of view, a temperature much lower than room temperature is required for the emergence of ferroelectricity in ZrO 2 thin films, in which a certain crystallite radius range exists for the o-phase formation. However, none of the reported ferroelectric properties are at such low temperatures. Therefore, certain other mechanisms must be invoked to explain the experimental observation of the ferroelectricity in undoped ZrO 2 . Considering the fact that the ZrO 2 film is prone to in situ crystallization during film growth, the stress effect along a certain crystallographic direction may create a favourable environment for the o-phase formation. Further studies are definitely needed to resolve this issue.

From Soup: 38 Fig. 7 shows the variations in the dielectric behaviour of the HZO films with different compositions and thicknesses. Details of the electrical data of each data point are reported elsewhere, 21,23,34,35,50,68,69 and the characteristic P – E curves are given in Fig. S6 in the ESI. † For this diagram, only the results with identical ALD conditions (Hf[N(C 2 H 5 )CH 3 ] 4 (TEMA-Hf) as the Hf precursor, Hf[N(C 2 H 5 )CH 3 ] 4 (TEMA-Zr) as the Zr-precursor, O 3 as the oxygen source, an ALD temperature of 280 °C, and TiN as the bottom electrode) and annealing conditions (500 °C for 30 seconds under a N 2 atmosphere) were adopted for consistency. The dielectric behaviour varies remarkably from an almost pure linear dielectric to a ferroelectric and an antiferroelectric-like one. As seen in the figure, strong ferroelectric properties could be achieved for the Zr/(Zr + Hf) ratio of roughly 0.4–0.6, and a thickness range of 5 to 20 nm. The t-phase region mostly coincides with the emergence of antiferroelectric-like behaviour, and as can be readily anticipated, the m-phase region coincides with the dielectric behaviour. At the phase boundary of the t- and o-phase, a broken hysteresis, which is expected for a material with first order phase transition slightly above T c , could be observed. 69 Locally different internal bias fields were also suggested to be the origin of pinched hysteresis in previous studies. 70,71 However, from the temperature-dependent P – E measurement in the previous study, the broken hysteresis in HZO films is believed to be a sign of a first order phase transition being the main cause of the broken hysteresis in the samples used in this work. 68 Some of the authors have claimed that such a broken hysteresis properly arises at the morphotrophic phase boundary, and it could be understood based on the classic first order phase transition theory. 68

From Soup: 39 Even though the schematic diagram in Fig. 7 is expected to provide a useful guideline for ALD of HZO films, it should be noted that this schematic diagram has many limitations. It cannot be applied to other deposition processes such as chemical solution deposition, 26 physical vapour deposition, 72 metal–organic chemical vapour deposition, 73,74 pulsed laser deposition, or even to atomic layer deposition with different deposition conditions. 19,75 Even in the case of HZO films deposited using ALD, this schematic phase diagram is not quantitatively precise since the polymorphism in the HZO thin films is affected by additional factors. Park et al. reported that the annealing temperature could affect the experimental P r values, which should be strongly related to the o-phase fraction. 21,76 According to previous studies, impurities such as C, 19 N, 18 and H 22 are expected to influence the polymorphism in doped HfO 2 or HZO films. Moreover, the growth behaviour and resulting polymorphism are also affected by the bottom electrode materials. 23,77 All these process parameters may influence the crystallite formation in the as-deposited state as well as after the crystallization annealing process. Although the electrical properties of ALD HZO films might be strongly affected by many additional factors, this schematic diagram is believed to be a very useful qualitative guideline for the fabrication of HZO films with ferroelectric or antiferroelectric-like properties.

From Soup: 40 In conclusion, the crystallographic phases in ALD HZO films were comprehensively studied by a comparison with the thermodynamic surface energy model. The emergence of non-stable or meta-stable o- and t-phases, which correspond to ferroelectric and antiferroelectric-like phases, respectively, in terms of the bulk free energy is due to the contribution of a lower grain boundary or an interface energy of these meta-stable phases. A recent theoretical study of the surface energy terms provided a solid support for such an assertion, but the original report made the assumption that the grain boundary and the interface energies are identical to the free surface energy, which is a problematic assumption. Therefore, a grain boundary energy of 1/3 of the surface energy was assumed in this work. In addition, the distribution of the grain size in annealed polycrystalline HZO films with different compositions was also carefully and quantitatively included in the theoretical estimation of the phase evolution based on the total free energy, i.e. bulk energy and grain boundary energy, calculation. Although the overall trends, i.e. there are certain composition and thickness ranges for the optimum ferroelectric performances, of both the theoretical expectation and the experimental results are consistent, there remains a critical mismatch. The theory predicts that the optimum ferroelectric properties could be achieved near a Zr-concentration of about 70% and a film thickness of up to 25 nm. In contrast, the experiment showed that a Zr-concentration of about 50% and a thin film thickness of less than 20 nm are the optimum conditions. Such a theoretical expectation can actually be applied to the case of a direct transition of a purely amorphous material into polycrystalline layers with specified grain size distributions. The experimental results are not necessarily reflecting this situation. In fact, the as-deposited ALD films have crystalline nuclei with a common size of 4 ± 0.5 nm, which was estimated using the Scherrer equation for the GIXRD peak broadening, for the films with Zr content from 47 to 100% having different degrees of crystallinity depending on the Zr-concentration. Higher Zr-concentration showed higher degree of in situ crystallization. The theoretical calculations for the stable phases of such small crystallites based on the assumption that the interface energy between the crystallite and the amorphous matrix is 1/3–1/2 of the free surface energy revealed that the o- and t-phases were stable at Zr-concentrations of about 50% and about 70%, respectively. Therefore, these crystalline nuclei work as seeds for the heterogeneous nucleation and growth during the subsequent PMA process. This interpretation matches very well with the observed electrical performance of the films with different compositions and thicknesses. The effect of the film stress (∼2 GPa) on the free energy of the crystalline phases and the role of the TiN capping layer were considered as well. Their effects seemed to have less influence in resolving the differences between theory and experiments. Finally, a schematic diagram of the dielectric behaviours as a function of composition and thickness was presented as a guideline for the fabrication of ferroelectric or antiferroelectric-like HZO films using the ALD process.
