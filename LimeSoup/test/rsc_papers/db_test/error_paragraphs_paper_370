From cou.: 1 Welcome to the inaugural “Emerging Investigators” themed collection from Inorganic Chemistry Frontiers! The purpose of this collection is to recognize outstanding inorganic chemists in the early stages of their independent careers. We thank all of the 49 contributors from throughout the world. Here we introduce to you these up-and-coming scientists and their exciting research in today's inorganic chemistry.

From cou.: 2 A. Gaita Ariño obtained his PhD in 2003 working with Prof. Coronado and Dr Clemente Juan in the University of Valencia (UV). After collaborations with Dr Suaud in Toulouse and Prof. Loss in Basel, he moved on to a three-year postdoctoral stay with Prof. Stamp in Vancouver. Since 2010, he has enjoyed a postdoctoral position in the UV, and since August 2015 he has been funded by an ERC Consolidator Grant. He is currently interested in the theoretical modelling of rare-earth single-ion magnets, in the rational design of coherent molecular spin qubits and in modelling of the coupling of lattice phonons with molecular excitations.
