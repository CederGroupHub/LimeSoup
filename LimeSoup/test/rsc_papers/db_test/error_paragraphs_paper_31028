From cou.: 1 The enzyme nitrous oxide reductase (N2OR) has a unique tetranuclear copper centre [Cu4S], called CuZ, at the catalytic site for the two-electron reduction of N2O to N2. The X- and Q-band EPR spectra have been recorded from two forms of the catalytic site of the enzyme N2OR from Paracoccus pantotrophus, namely, a form prepared anaerobically, CuZ, that undergoes a one-electron redox cycle and CuZ*, prepared aerobically, which cannot be redox cycled. The spectra of both species are axial with that of CuZ showing a rich hyperfine splitting in the g‖-region at X-band. DFT calculations were performed to gain insight into the electronic configuration and ground-state properties of CuZ and to calculate EPR parameters. The results for the oxidation state [Cu+13Cu+21S]3+ are in good agreement with values obtained from the fitting of experimental spectra, confirming the absolute oxidation state of CuZ. The unpaired spin density in this configuration is delocalised over four copper ions, thus, CuI 20.1%, CuII 9.5%, CuIII 4.8% and CuIV 9.2%, the µ4-sulfide ion and oxygen ligand. The three copper ions carrying the highest spin density plus the sulfide ion lie approximately in the same plane while the fourth copper ion is perpendicular to this plane and carries only 4.8% spin density. It is suggested that the atoms in this plane represent the catalytic core of CuZ, allowing electron redistribution within the plane during interaction with the substrate, N2O.

From cou.: 2 The copper enzyme nitrous oxide reductase (N2OR) catalyses the final step in the process of bacterial denitrification, namely the two-electron reduction of nitrous oxide to dinitrogen.1,2 N2OR is a homodimeric protein with two different multi-copper centres per subunit, called CuA and CuZ. A binuclear copper centre, CuA, transfers electrons from an electron donor, either cytochrome c or pseudoazurin,3–7 to a second centre, called CuZ,8 the catalytic site for nitrous oxide reduction. The latter is a novel mixed-valence cluster, [Cu4S]n+, with a sulfide ion bridging a distorted tetrahedron of copper atoms, the first reported biological example of an inorganic sulfide ion as part of a multi-copper cluster (Fig. 1).9–11 The [Cu4S]n+ core is bound to the protein via seven conserved histidine residues. An oxygen atom, either as water or hydroxide ion, is proposed to bridge two of the copper atoms. Structures of N2OR have been reported from two sources, Pseudomonas nautica at 2.4 Å resolution and from Paracoccus denitrificans at 1.6 Å.8,10,12

From cou.: 3 There is great interest in understanding how this novel catalytic centre activates and reduces the substrate, N2O. There are few metal coordination complexes known of the linear molecule N2O and so there is little understanding of the way in which N2O might bind and be activated by such a cluster. In this account we report the EPR properties of CuZ in order to define its accessible redox states, and hence the electron storage capacity of the cluster. This a prerequisite to understanding the mechanism and the capability to catalyse the reduction of N2O.

From cou.: 4 In a biological environment copper can adopt oxidation states +1 or +2. Hence, in principle, five different oxidation states of CuZ could arise (Fig. 1(A)). The total cluster spins can readily be written down. Only two of the five redox states will have non-integer cluster spins, namely, [Cu4S]5+ and [Cu4S]3+, and these are, therefore, the only states that will show perpendicular mode EPR signals. We have reported that an EPR-silent state of CuZ can be reduced in a one-electron step, with a midpoint potential Em = +60 mV, to an EPR-active state.13 Thus the step either from [Cu+24S]6+ to [Cu+11Cu+23S]5+ or from [Cu+12Cu+22S]4+ to [Cu+13Cu+21S]3+ would account for this result. Recently, Chen et al.14 reported spectroscopic and electronic structure studies of the sulfide bridged tetranuclear CuZ cluster in N2O reductase. Based on the application of K-edge XAS in combination with DFT calculations it was concluded that the ground state of CuZ has the oxidation level 3Cu+1/1Cu+2.

From cou.: 5 The properties of the catalytic centre of N2OR are puzzling since it has not proved possible to observe any major spectroscopic changes to CuZ either in response to the presence of substrate, N2O, or of inhibitors such as azide ion. However, we have shown that this cluster occurs in at least two forms, which we have called CuZ and CuZ*.11,13,15 If oxygen is present during the preparation of the enzyme N2OR, a catalytic centre is formed which does give an EPR signal but does not show any redox activity with reagents such as dithionite or ferricyanide. This form of the centre is designated CuZ*. On the other hand in anaerobic preparations of the enzyme the catalytic site is capable of undergoing a one-electron reversible redox cycle at Em = +60 mV. This form is denoted CuZ. Nevertheless, both forms of the enzyme have similar steady-state enzymatic activities. The EPR-active redox state of CuZ* must be structurally similar to that of reduced CuZ found in anaerobic preparations since spectroscopic properties, including EPR, MCD, CD, Raman and UV/Vis, are closely similar.11,13 However, the differences, which lie at the root of the changed redox properties, remain unknown. The crystal structure obtained from P. nautica N2OR, aerobically prepared, appear to consist of CuA in the reduced state and the catalytic centre in the form of CuZ* in the EPR active state.13

From cou.: 6 In this paper, we investigate the electronic structure of the ground-state of the CuZ cluster by fitting experimental EPR parameters and by using density functional theory (DFT), together with the crystal structure of CuZ in P. denitrificans,8,10,12 to calculate unpaired spin densities in the [Cu4S]3+ oxidation state. Good agreement between the experiment and calculation suggests a valid description of the electronic distribution in the complex.

From cou.: 7 N2OR from Pa. pantotrophus was purified under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as described elsewhere.13 The aerobic N2OR sample had a dimer concentration of 0.17 mM while the anaerobic sample had a concentration of 0.44 mM. By analysing these samples using MCD spectroscopy and EPR spin integration we have established that the anaerobic sample has a ratio of CuZ ∶ CuZ* of 7 ∶ 3 and the aerobic sample 3 ∶ 7. Samples were reduced with an excess of dithionite for 2 h in a glove-box before freezing in liquid nitrogen. X-Band EPR-spectra were measured on a Bruker ER200D spectrometer fitted with an Oxford Instruments ESR-9 flow cryostat at 15 K. Q-Band EPR spectra were performed on a Bruker ELEXYS spectrometer with an Oxford Instruments bath cryostat operated at 15 K. Spectra were accumulated to achieve a good signal-to-noise, S/N, ratio. Second-derivative spectra have been smoothed.

From cou.: 8 DFT calculations have been performed on a Linux/Pentium III based workstation using the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) program, version 2000.0.1, with the density functional including the local exchange-correlation approximation (LDA) of Vosko, Wilk and Nusair16–20 (VWN) and non-local gradient corrections for exchange21 (PW86x) and correlation22 (LYP). Spin-restricted, as well as spin-unrestricted, calculations were carried out, where the latter is used to give a better account of spin-polarization. The zero order regular approximation (ZORA) method was used to account for relativistic effects23 and g-tensor calculations were performed from a spin–orbit relativistic treatment implemented in the software package, which uses the spinor of the unpaired electron of the paramagnetic molecule, obtained from density functional calculation.16–20 An uncontracted triple-ζ basis set (ADF basis set IV) with a single polarization function was used for all atoms. In order to perform calculations for a relatively large system on a reasonable timescale, the core orbitals 1s (N, C, O), 2p for S and 3p for Cu ions were frozen. This is a reasonable approximation since calculated spin/electron densities, and related components of the g-tensor, depend on the distribution of the unpaired electron among valence atomic orbitals.

From cou.: 9 The EPR spectra at Q- and X-band of N2OR samples, from Pa. pantotrophus, reduced with dithionite have been recorded. Since CuA is completely reduced by dithionite to the EPR-silent, all-cuprous redox-state,24 such samples contain EPR signals only from the catalytic centre.

From cou.: 10 The Q-band spectra of anaerobic N2OR preparations show an axially symmetric g-tensor with g‖ = 2.15 and g⊥ = 2.035, Fig. 2. In aerobic preparations the g-values remain axial but are shifted slightly to lower field, g‖ = 2.16 and g⊥ = 2.042 with the g‖-signal becoming somewhat narrower. Hyperfine structure (hfs), partially resolved in the X-band EPR spectra, can be enhanced in the second-derivative mode (Fig. 4). These show that the broadening of the g‖-signal is due to changes in 10 hf lines in the g‖-region, (Fig. 4(a)). The hfs shows 21 lines over the whole spectrum and in the g‖-region ∼6 pairs of lines with a separation of some 70 MHz. This suggests the possibility of coupling to a nucleus of I = ½. However, the spectrum does not change after incubation of the protein in deuterated buffer (data not shown). Therefore, there are no contributions to the hyperfine structure from exchangeable protons. Neither does a pH change from 7.5 to 9.0 have any effect on the hfs (data not shown). For the aerobic sample, at least 7 lines are resolved in the g‖-region and 15 lines over the whole spectrum (Fig. 4(b)). However, the hfs is clearly different, no pairing of signals being observed.

From cou.: 20 The calculation of the ground-state electronic structure and unpaired electron spin density of complex mixed valence clusters such as CuZ is a challenge even to DFT methods.

EPR Spectra of the cluster measured at Q- and X-band have been collected from the enzyme from Pa. pantotrophus, prepared with careful control of the aerobic atmosphere to minimise the heterogeneity of the catalytic species. However, we have not found ways to prepare the enzyme in a completely homogeneous state and to our knowledge no other research groups have subjected their preparations to such an analysis. We can, nevertheless, produce samples in which one or the other form predominates at the level of 70%.13 Such preparations result in EPR spectra with a rich hfs. Reports of the EPR spectra of CuZ from other laboratories which have not attempted to control the forms of CuZ,14 show less well resolved structure than those reported here.

From cou.: 21 The calculated principal values of the g-tensors of [Cu+13Cu+21S]3+, Table 3, are in good agreement with those observed experimentally at X- and Q-band (Table 1). The fitted g-values are g‖ = 2.150 and g⊥ = 2.035 for CuZ and g‖ = 2.160 and g⊥ = 2.042 for CuZ* compared with calculated values of g‖ = 2.130 and g⊥ = 2.050 (g⊥ are averaged values of g22 and g33 in Table 3). This is a good agreement between calculation and experiment. Slight differences between the calculated and observed values could be either due to the lack of precision of the coordinates from the protein crystal structure or that the ZORA method when used in conjugation with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional tends to underestimate gmax shifts for transition metal complexes.28–31 It should be recognised that conventional DFT functionals (as implemented in the ADF package) generate a bonding distribution which often overemphasises covalency.26 This would lead to a decrease of spin density on the copper ions which, in turn, will lower the value of the principal component of the g-tensor. Although the quantitative agreement should be considered within the systematic error of the ZORA method we discuss below the possible significance of this result in a qualitative way.

From cou.: 22 Therefore, we conclude that the oxidation state [Cu+13Cu+21S]3+ accounts for the experimental EPR data. This is in agreement with the work of Chen et al.14,32 based on the application of K-edge XAS in combination with DFT calculations. These authors also reported DFT calculation of the electronic structure of P. nautica CuZ using a spectroscopically calibrated hybrid functional approach.14,32 In this work the structural parameters of the active site were modified by averaging over two monomer units and adjusting M–M and M–L bonds of P. nautica CuZ to the more accurate values of the P. denitrificans N2OR structure.14 In addition, histidine ligands were modelled as NH3 to simplify the system. The oxygen ligand was taken to be a water molecule rather an OH−. DFT calculations by Chen et al.14,32 for this geometry concluded that the largest unpaired spin density is localized on a single copper ion, CuI (42%), although CuII also has a significant spin density of 16%. However, the DFT calculations of the oxidation state [Cu+13Cu+21S]3+ suggest that the unpaired electron spin density is delocalised across all four copper ions, the μ4-bridging sulfide ion and an oxide (or OH−) ion.
From Soup: 22 Therefore, we conclude that the oxidation state [Cu +1 3 Cu +2 1 S] 3+ accounts for the experimental EPR data. This is in agreement with the work of Chen et al . 14,32 based on the application of K-edge XAS in combination with DFT calculations. These authors also reported DFT calculation of the electronic structure of P. nautica Cu Z using a spectroscopically calibrated hybrid functional approach. 14,32 In this work the structural parameters of the active site were modified by averaging over two monomer units and adjusting M–M and M–L bonds of P. nautica Cu Z to the more accurate values of the P. denitrificans N 2 OR structure. 14 In addition, histidine ligands were modelled as NH 3 to simplify the system. The oxygen ligand was taken to be a water molecule rather an OH − .

From cou.: 23 This spin distribution [Cu+13Cu+21S]3+ can be correlated with the following structural features. The five atoms CuI, CuII, CuIV, S and O lie almost in a plane, defined as XY in Fig. 1(B). Moreover, the nitrogen atoms of the histidine ligands surrounding the copper atoms CuII and CuIV also lie close to this plane. For example, the dihedral angles for CuZ from P. denitrificans are CuI–CuII–S–Cu IV = −165° and O–S–CuIV–CuII = 179°. The S–CuIII direction is almost perpendicular to this plane as shown by the dihedral angle CuIII–S–CuII–CuIV = −94° and the angles CuIII–S–CuIV = 85° and CuIII–S–CuI = 95°. Together with the spin distribution, these structural features of the active site geometry suggest that spin delocalisation takes place mainly within this plane. The partial valence localisation within this planar system will be sensitive to local structural variation. On the other hand, CuIII, which is perpendicular to the plane, takes little share of the unpaired spin density.

From cou.: 24 The orbitals involved are illustrated in Fig. 5. The unpaired electron resides largely in the effective dx2−y2 orbitals of CuI, CuII and CuIV where the local zi axes are taken to be collinear with the cluster Z axis. The orbitals are shown with lobes pointing towards one another. This orientation depends on the amount of antibonding interaction made with the p-orbital of S that lies in the same plane. The small contribution to the spin density from the CuIII ion perpendicular to the XY-plane arises mainly from a local dyz-orbital with lobes in a plane perpendicular to the CuICuIICuIV plane.

From cou.: 25 The almost planar arrangement of five of the atoms of CuZ has two important consequences for the paramagnetic properties observed. First, each of the three copper ions has an effective square planar geometry which dictates a dx2−y2-orbital as the ground-state wavefunction for each of the local ligand geometries. Second, since all the local square planes lie approximately in one plane the principal directions of each of the three local hypothetical axial gi-tensors are expected to be collinear as well. For monomeric CuII sites with a d9-configuration and axial symmetry the expressions for the spin-Hamiltonian parameters from MO theory are well known33

From Soup: 43 Given that all three g i -tensors are collinear, the resulting g -tensor of the planar triangular group of Cu ions is essentially a delocalised weighted sum of the monomer g -tensors of the three subsystems:
 ###### 
From cou.: 44 II
From Soup: 44 In these equations the ratios between the weighting coefficients, C i , equal the ratios of the contributions of copper d x 2 − y 2 -orbitals 34 to the spin density of the ground-state wavefunction and the condition should be satisfied.

From Soup: 45 Assuming that all three collinear single-ion g i -tensors have similar values of their principal components, two slightly different spin distributions among three copper ions will result in the same averaged picture for the principal components of the global g -tensor. We illustrate this by carrying out DFT calculations of Cu Z introducing slight variation in the distances between ions and ligands in the plane, namely between Cu ions, S 2− and OH − . The resulting spin distribution ratios, see Table 2 , are approximately 4 ∶ 2 ∶ 1 ∶ 2 for Cu I , Cu II , Cu III , Cu IV which is different to the distribution rations of approximately 3 ∶ 2 ∶ 1 ∶ 4 obtained for P. denitrificans. Nevertheless, the EPR pattern of principal g -values is predicted to be very similar when the unpaired electron density is redistributed among the Cu ions in the XY -plane ( Table 3 ). This is, however, not the case for hfs patterns.

From Soup: 46 Although the EPR data for Cu Z from anaerobic N 2 OR preparations show pairs of signals in the second derivative of the X-band EPR spectra ( Fig. 4(a) ), they are not due to the interaction with a proton since H/D exchange of the buffer causes no detectable changes to the EPR spectrum. A proton on the bridging oxygen ligand would be expected to undergo ready H/D exchange and we would expect a smaller value of the hfs than 70 MHz. It is unlikely that the hydrogen atom of a histidine ligand is the cause of this pairing because the spin density on these ligands is too low to yield the splitting constants observed of about 70 MHz. The DFT calculations for Cu Z * that include a proton directly bounded to sulfur predict an isotropic hyperfine coupling of only 0.25 MHz from the proton , much lower than the 70 MHz splitting observed. This is because most of the contribution from S to the spin density comes from the p-orbital in the XY -plane, plus a very low contribution from the p z -orbital. This would account for the reported ENDOR results which showed no hydrogen hfs. 10,35 In an attempt to find evidence for a contribution to the hfs from a proton , a fitting of the second-derivative X-band EPR spectra of Cu Z (anaerobic preparation of N 2 OR) has been undertaken. Included in the model Hamiltonian is an additional hyperfine coupling interaction with bound hydrogen ( I H = ½). All attempts failed to reproduce the ∼70 MHz splitting of the lines in the second-derivative EPR spectra. However, the peaks can be reproduced in the calculated spectrum by using a different ratio for the hfs of Cu ions. For the case of Cu Z all three values of the principal components of the g -tensor obtained from the fitting of EPR spectra are lower than those for Cu Z * and the ratios for the adjusted hyperfine coupling parameters are approximately 2.2 ∶ 2 ∶ 1 ( Table 3 ). We note also that the presence of a proton bound to the sulfide ion improves the overall agreement somewhat to g ‖ = 2.151, g ⊥ = 2.045 ( Table 3 ).

From Soup: 47 We have probed the electronic structure of Cu Z and Cu Z * in the oxidation state [Cu +1 3 Cu +2 1 S] 3+ by means of EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The results are broadly in agreement with the earlier report by Chen et al . 14 who probed the oxidation state by K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy . Our analysis suggests that the unpaired spin density is substantially delocalised in the cluster and is distributed mainly over a quasi-planar structure, consisting of Cu I , Cu II , Cu IV , S and O. The calculated g -factors from this spin distribution are in agreement with EPR experimental data . This spin distribution is somewhat different from those reported by Chen et al . 14,32 who characterized their model as “class II partially delocalised mixed-valent system” with spin residing mainly on Cu I although with a significant contribution from Cu II . However, the detailed analysis of the results of DFT calculations and simulated EPR spectra shows that different spin distributions among Cu I , Cu II , Cu IV atoms in the XY plane can result in the same values of principal components of g -tensor. Given that the major spin density lies in the XY plane, the EPR spectra of either a partially delocalised system 14,32 or a completely localized system within that plane would have very similar g -tensor components. However, fits of EPR spectra require substantial contributions from three Cu ions to the hfs with the approximate ratios A ‖, ⊥ (1) ∶ A ‖, ⊥ (2) ∶ A ‖, ⊥ (3) as 2 ∶ 2 ∶ 1 and 2 ∶ 1 ∶ 1 for Cu Z and Cu Z *, respectively, showing that the Cu Z cluster represents a delocalised mixed-valence system. This result is supported by DFT calculations which show that the spin density resides mainly in the plane of the Cu I , Cu II , Cu IV ions ( XY plane). Our model of the electronic structure of the Cu Z cluster will allow assignments of the optical properties to be made. The hfs in the second-derivative EPR spectra of Cu Z shows a complicated pattern with an apparent pairing of signals. This pattern cannot be explained by coupling to a proton since H/D exchange studies do not alter or affect the spectrum .

From Soup: 48 The delocalisation of spin density over the atoms Cu I , Cu II , Cu IV , S and O invites the speculation that this is the catalytic core that interacts with the substrate, N 2 O. If N 2 O were to bind, say, along the Cu I –Cu IV -edge by displacing the O(OH − ) ligand , π-interaction between the core and the ligand would facilitate binding and charge redistribution to assist in the breaking of the N–O bond of the substrate. Recently Solomon et al . 36 have proposed a model suggesting that the [Cu +1 4 S] 2+ form of Cu Z is the active state in catalytic reduction with N 2 O binding in a bent μ-1,3-bridging mode with strong back-bonding from Cu I and Cu IV .
