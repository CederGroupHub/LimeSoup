From Soup: 0 The density functional theory (DFT) method and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis have been employed to investigate the electronic structures and second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties for tricarbonyl metal derivatives of a Lindqvist-type polyoxometalate, [Nb2W4O19M(CO)3]3−/2− (M = MnI, TcI, ReI, FeII, RuII and OsII). The position of the tricarbonyl metal ligand and the substitution of different metal atoms M have an influence on the electronic absorption spectra and NLO responses of all complexes. Among the three isomers of [Nb2W4O19Mn(CO)3]3−, the β0 value of isomer 1a is the largest, which is 1.4 times and 2.3 times larger than those of isomers 1b and 1c, respectively. The β0 value also depends on the tricarbonyl metal M, the β0 value decreases in the order M = Ru > Re > Fe > Os > Mn > Tc. In addition, the analysis of the main transition orbitals shows that the tricarbonyl metal ligand acts as an electron donor in [Nb2W4O19M(CO)3]3−/2− (M = MnI, TcI, ReI, RuII and OsII), while the [Fe(CO)3]2+ ligand acts as an electron acceptor in [Nb2W4O19Fe(CO)3]2−.

From Soup: 3 Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials have received tremendous attention owing to their unique applications in optical fibers, data storage, optical limiting, computing and switching. Among these NLO materials, the donor–acceptor (D–A) model has been widely used. POM complexes with the electron storage ability can be designed as a good electron-acceptor group. 11–13 So the POM-based complexes with good thermal and photochemical stability as well as redox switching ability are potential NLO materials. Theoretical studies would be helpful in rationalization of the observed properties and design of novel POM-based hybrid materials with excellent properties. Previous studies on related POMs show that DFT calculations give a satisfactory description of the geometrical structures, bonding character, redox properties, charge-transfer and NLO properties. 14–17

From Soup: 4 Obviously, POM-supported metal carbonyl derivatives are potential NLO materials, while studies on second-order NLO properties and electronic structures of tricarbonyl metal polyanions are rare. In the present work, DFT calculations were performed to investigate the electronic structures and nonlinear optical properties of tricarbonyl metal derivatives of the Lindqvist-type POM. The calculation models of complexes are shown in Fig. 1 . In cis-[Nb2W4O19]4−, there are three different types of bridging oxygen atoms, which bond to two niobiums (Ob1), one niobium and one tungsten (Ob2), or two tungstens (Ob3). The experimental spectra 2 provide conclusive evidence for the presence of all three isomers. In isomer a, the M(CO)3 binding site is formed by one ONb2 oxygen and two ONbW oxygens. In isomer b, two ONbW oxygens and one OW2 oxygen are involved, and in isomer c, three OW2 oxygens form the binding site. The complex [Nb2W4O19Mn(CO)3]3− was taken as an example to investigate the difference in geometrical and electronic structures among the three isomers. In order to investigate the effect of the tricarbonyl center metal M on NLO properties of [Nb2W4O19M(CO)3]3−/2−, Mn or Re was substituted by other d6 metals (TcI, FeII, RuII, and OsII).

From Soup: 5 The quantum chemical calculations were carried out using the GAUSSIAN 09W program package. 18 The ground states of all the studied complexes were closed-shell singlet states and the geometries were optimized at the BP86/6-31G(d) level. This functional has given good insight into the structure. Considering the relativistic effects for transition-metal atoms, the LANL2DZ basis set was applied for metal atoms in this work. The static first hyperpolarizabilities (β0) were calculated by using analytical third energy derivatives, which are more efficient and less expensive than numerical derivatives 19 and with the pure functional MPWPW91* 20 and the long-range corrected CAM-B3LYP functional 21 to examine the reliability of the calculated results. The static first hyperpolarizability is termed as the zero-frequency hyperpolarizability and is an estimate of the intrinsic molecular hyperpolarizability in the absence of any resonance effects. Thus, β0 is defined as where

From Soup: 8 In this study, all complexes have similar structures which contain one identical cis-[Nb2W4O19]4− unit joined by one fac-{M(CO)3}+/2+ moiety, M = Mn (1), Tc (2), Re (3), Fe (4), Ru (5), and Os (6). It exhibits slight differences in bond distances of MO3C3 coordinated octahedra with different M centres. In all complexes, a tricarbonyl metal unit bonds to a triangle bridging oxygen on the surface of a [Nb2W4O19]4− anion. We take 1 as an example to discuss the difference in structural parameters of the three isomers (1a, 1b, 1c) in detail. 1a and 1c contain a mirror plane, and possess Cs symmetry, while 1b has no symmetry. The calculations indicate that 1a is the most stable isomer with energies of 0.8 and 0.9 kcal mol−1, which are lower than 1b and 1c, respectively. The small energy differences are compatible with the existence of the three isomers in solution ( Table 1 ).

From Soup: 9 Among 1a, 1b and 1c, the calculated average bond length of C–O is 1.17 Å, which is in good agreement with the experimental results 1.14 Å. It suggests that the functional and basis sets that we adopted are reliable for the studied complexes. In 1a, 1b and 1c, the difference in Mn–C and C–O bond lengths is about 0.001 Å, illustrating that the structure of the tricarbonyl metal ligand in the three isomers is basically consistent. The Mn–Ob bond length is 2.087 Å for 1a, 2.079 Å for 1b, and 2.071 Å for 1c, showing that the position of the tricarbonyl metal ligand slightly affects the Mn–Ob bond length.

From Soup: 12 The Mn–C bonds in three isomers (1a–1c) are very similar with obvious single-bond nature as indicated by the calculated WBI of 1.169–1.182. However, with different metals, M = Mn (1), Tc (2), Re (3), Fe (4), Ru (5), Os (6), the interaction between M and C is slightly different, 3 (1.365) > 6 (1.195); 2 (1.290) > 5 (1.059); 1b (1.182) > 4 (0.962), which is consistent with the M–C bond length, 3 (1.908) < 6 (1.913); 2 (1.909) < 5 (1.923); 1b (1.781) < 4 (1.800).

From Soup: 13 Based on the BP86 optimized structures of tricarbonyl metal Lindqvist-type polyoxometalate complexes [Nb2W4O19M(CO)3]3−/2− (M = MnI, TcI, ReI, FeII, RuII and OsII), TDDFT was used to calculate the excited-state properties of complexes. The calculated absorption wavelengths, oscillator strength (f0) and major transition states for the studied complexes are summarized in Table 3 . The absorption UV-Vis spectra of all complexes are illustrated in Fig. 2 . As shown in Fig. 2(a) , the UV-vis absorption spectra of 1a–1c display one intense absorption (λmax) in the range of 260–270 nm, which follows the order: 1a (270 nm) > 1b (264 nm) > 1c (260 nm). It also can be seen that the absorption bands of 1a–1c undergo a slight shift from 270 nm to 260 nm. The frontier molecular orbitals involved in the dominant electronic transitions in 1a–1c are shown in Fig. 3 . The charge transition characteristics of 1a, 1b and 1c are similar and the transition molecular orbitals of 1b are taken as representatives, so the charge transition characteristic 1b is analyzed. In 1b, the H−2 → L+6 and H−1 → L+5 transitions can be assigned to the CT from the p orbitals of Ob atoms in POM and the tricarbonyl metal ligand to Nb/W atoms. The H−6 → L+1 and H−11 → L transitions occur between Nb/W atoms and O atoms in POM. The [Nb2W4] acts as an electron acceptor and the tricarbonyl metal ligand acts as an electron donor. The charge transition characteristics of 1a, 1b and 1c show that the position of the tricarbonyl metal ligand has a slight influence on the orbital transition.

From Soup: 14 As shown in Fig. 2(b) , 1b, 2 and 3 show an intense absorption at around 265 nm, 4–6 show a broad band at 240–260 nm. The spectra of 2 and 3 have similar transition features to 1b. The blue shifts of the absorption are observed in 4–6 compared with 1b, 2 and 3. It indicates that the more positive charge of [M(CO)3] (FeII, RuII and OsII) units causes the blue shifted absorption peak. In order to concisely describe the transition character, the electron density differences between the ground state and the dominant excited state were also plotted using GaussSum2.2 ( Fig. 4 ). For 2, 3, 5 and 6, the decreasing electron density mainly localizes on the tricarbonyl segment and oxygen atoms of POM, while the increasing electron density mainly localizes on the Nb/W atoms. The tricarbonyl ligand acts as an electron acceptor and the POM acts as an electron donor, which is consistent with MPCT. It can be seen that the increasing electron density in 4 mainly localizes on the tricarbonyl segment and oxygen atoms of POM, while the decreasing electron density mainly localizes on the Nb/W atoms. We infer that the large electronegativity of FeII (4) has an important influence, which leads to the tricarbonyl ligand acting as an electron acceptor.

From Soup: 15 The β0 values computed by MPWMPW91* and CAM-B3LYP functionals are listed in Table 4 . The functional CAM-B3LYP results are larger than that of the MPWMPW91* functional.

The β0 values of 3 and 5 are calculated to be 11.325 and 11.221 × 10−30 esu by the CAM-B3LYP functional, the little difference may be in the range of calculation errors. Therefore, the MPWMPW91* functional was used to compute the second-order polarizabilities. The β0 value of 1a is about 1.5 times as large as that of 1b, which is about 1.6 times as large as that of 1c. It indicates that the orientation of the tricarbonyl metal ligand affects the β0 values of 1a–1c. For all complexes, the tricarbonyl ligand locates the y-axis direction. The larger βy component indicates that the CT between the tricarbonyl ligand and POM is decisive for 1a and 1b.

From Soup: 16 When M is Mn, Tc and Re, the β0 values present the order: β0 (3) > β0 (1b) > β0 (2); when M is Fe, Ru and Os, the β0 values present the order: β0 (5) > β0 (4) > β0 (6). Among all complexes, 5 shows the largest β0 value, 12.456 × 10−30 esu according to the MPWPW91* calculations. Compared with those of 1b and 2 (6.287 and 5.455 × 10−30 esu), 4 and 5 have larger β0 values, 10.807 and 12.456 × 10−30 esu, respectively. Furthermore, for all complexes except for 2βy tensor components are small; the large βy tensor components of complexes indicate that the charge transfer in the y direction plays an important role.

From Soup: 18 We report a theoretical study on the first hyperpolarizabilities, electronic transitions, and charge transfer involved in the second-order nonlinear optical response of tricarbonyl metal derivatives of a Lindqvist-type polyoxometalate [Nb2W4O19M(CO)3]3−/2− (M = MnI, TcI, ReI, FeII, RuII and OsII). The relative energy analysis suggests that the isomer 1a is the most stable among the three isomers, 1a, 1b, 1c. The calculations show that the nonlinear optical response coefficient of the isomer 1a is the largest among the three isomers. Interestingly, among metal-substituted complexes, [Nb2W4O19Ru(CO)3]2− has the largest β0 value. The analysis of the molecular orbital indicates that [Nb2W4O19]4− acts as an electron acceptor and the tricarbonyl metal ligand acts as an electron donor in all complexes except for [Nb2W4O19Fe(CO)3]2−. In [Nb2W4O19Fe(CO)3]2−, the tricarbonyl metal ligand [Fe(CO)3]2+ displays the electron acceptor character.
