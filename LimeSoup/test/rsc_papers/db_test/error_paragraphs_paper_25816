From cou.: 1 The redox chemistry of a newly synthesized small dendrimer containing six peripheral viologen units and a phosphazene core is described. The one-electron reduction of each viologen (total six electrons) leads to intermolecular dimerization of the reduced viologens borne by the same phosphorous atom, resulting in a color change from colourless to purple providing it with potential electrochromic applications.

From cou.: 2 The growing evidence of climate change which is brought about by emissions of CO2 promoted by human activities has many predicted1 consequences associated with it, including drought, more violent storms, and deglaciation, to name just a few. The reduction of CO2 emissions has received serious attention from both the private and public sectors. One promising strategy towards this goal lies in improving the energy efficiency of current technologies that burn fossil fuels. Strikingly, energy consumption from buildings, and not transportation, is the greatest2 source of CO2 emissions. Increasing the heating and cooling efficiencies of buildings would have a significant positive impact on the environment.

From cou.: 4 The ability to prompt a fast and reversible movement of large amplitude in molecular bodies has appeared as a major scientific objective which is mainly driven by exciting foreseen applications in nanoscience. From this promising and highly competitive domain, a large number of nanometric small-scale mimics of macroscopic tools known as molecular machines,4 such as tweezers,5 gears,6 rotors,7 shuttles,8 muscles,9 and elevators10 that fulfill these requirements, have been designed to respond to various external stimuli, such as pH,11 redox change,12 temperature and light.13 We have employed these design principles in the synthesis and operation of our electrochromic material.

From cou.: 5 Viologens, a class of compounds containing a 4,4′-bipyridinium dicationic core (BIPY2+), are well known for their rich redox chemistry, in particular the stable BIPY˙+ radical cation intermediate that is formed upon a one-electron reduction.14 In solution, BIPY˙+ displays an intense blue color as a result of a strong absorption band at ∼600 nm (ε605 ∼ 7500 M−1 cm−1 for methylviologen MV˙+ in MeCN15). For this reason, BIPY˙+ radical cations have been employed extensively as electrochromic materials.16 The ability of two BIPY˙+ radical cations to undergo dimerization15,17 is driven by radical–radical interactions mostly a consequence of pairing of the two spins into a singlet state. Upon dimerization, the absorption band at ∼600 nm is blue-shifted to ∼540 nm (purple color), while a significant absorption band at ∼870 nm (CT absorption) in the NIR region of the spectrum emerges. A large amount of research efforts have been directed towards enhancing the stability of these dimers in solution, including host–guest chemistry, mechanostereochemistry, and covalent preorganization.18 Radical cation π-dimerization, also known as “pimerization”,19 has been employed to generate a mechanical movement in the form of translation as well as rotation in mechanically interlocked molecules.20 Recently, Bucher et al. employed this pimerization to prepare a redox-activated rotating molecular carousel based on ferrocene and BIPY2+ units.21 The electrochromic properties of the BIPY˙+ dimer, however, have not been thoroughly investigated. Herein, we employ the strategy of covalent preorganization in a new phosphorus-based dendrimer (noted HV12+) containing six terminal BIPY2+ units homogeneously distributed on the periphery of the well-known hexatopic core, cyclotriphosphazene (CTP).

From cou.: 6 CTP can be easily hexa-functionalized through nucleophilic substitution reactions22 on the corresponding hexachloride (NPCl2)3 analog leading to a nearly planar system where the phosphorous atoms are almost tetrahedral (sp3) and the nitrogen atoms approach an sp2 geometry.23 CTP moieties exhibit excellent thermal and chemical stabilities and are photochemically and electrochemically inert. As a consequence, they do not interfere with the photophysical and electrochemical properties centered on the grafted redox active chromophores. The easiness of CTP ring functionalization coupled to the structural rigidity of the products makes CTP an attractive core for the construction of multifunctional and robust systems.

From cou.: 8 The redox-activated intramolecular dimerization is depicted in Scheme 1b. In the fully oxidized state of HV12+, the individual BIPY2+ units of the functionalized core repel each other as a consequence of Coulombic repulsion. A one-electron reduction of each of the BIPY2+ units results in the formation of the BIPY˙+ radical cation, which very quickly undergoes intramolecular π-dimerization with its nearest neighbor on the central core. Although both BIPY˙+ units are still positively charged, spin pairing of the radicals into a singlet state in addition to their reduced charge overpowers the electrostatic repulsion.

From cou.: 10 We first examined the redox processes of BMV2+ as a control. BMV2+ is characterized by two reversible one-electron redox processes (E11/2 = −0.29 V, ΔE = 80 mV and E21/2 = −0.68 V, ΔE = 80 mV), while the CV voltammogram of hexaviologen dendrimer HV12+ can be interpreted by two reversible six electrons processes (E11/2 = −0.27 V, ΔE = 60 mV and E21/2 = −0.7 V, ΔE = 70 mV). The voltammetric wave of HV12+ has a shape that matches that of the corresponding molecule with a single electroactive center BMV2+, an observation consistent with the fact that the six identical and independent viologens within HV12+ are noninteracting electroactive centers.24a On the other hand, the difference in the magnitude of the peak-to-peak separation between BMV2+ and HV12+ (ΔE1/2 = 390 mV and 430 mV for the BMV2+ and HV12+, respectively) is an indication of the intramolecular dimerization occurring in HV12+.24c More precisely, BMV2+ compound exhibits two successive reversible reductions occurring at −0.33 and −0.72 V, generating the BMV˙+ radical cation and the fully reduced BMV0 neutral compound, respectively. Similarly, the CV of HV12+ reveals two reversible redox processes although slightly positively shifted for the first process at −0.30 V and slightly negatively shifted for the second process at −0.74 V. Chronocoulometric experiments (see ESI†) further demonstrate that the first reversible redox process of HV12+/HV6(˙+) involves six electrons, while that of BMV2+/BMV˙+ implies only one-electron transfer. It is well known that the thermodynamic stability of BIPY˙+ π-dimers induces positive shifts in the first redox-potential, while the second reduction processes leading to BIPY0 become negatively shifted.24b Square wave voltammetry (Fig. 1b) normalized to the ferrocene redox-couple further confirms the shifts of the first and second redox-potentials of HV12+ with respect to BMV2+. These shifts are much lower in magnitude, however, in comparison to the viologen dimers stabilized for example by CB[8],14f,24,25 or covalent preorganization, which is over 50 mV for both the first and second redox processes in each case. The relatively smaller shifts can be explained by the following mechanistic interpretation.

From Soup: 35 Although the shifts in the redox potentials are small ( E 1 1/2 ( BMV 2+ ) − E 1 1/2 ( HV 12+ ) = 40 mV, the fact that the number of electrons transferred is six still leads to large values of β Dim . If one speculates about a system composed of only two BIPY˙ + units linked together covalently with a comparable value of β Dim , one would expect the shift in the redox-potentials to be three times large. Previous reports showed that this is indeed the case. 26 Digitally simulated CVs (see ESI † ) based on this proposed mechanism match well with our experimental data .

From Soup: 36 In order to provide additional evidence for the intramolecular dimerization of the BIPY˙ + radical units within HV D 6( ˙ +) , we carried out variable concentration spectrophotometric titrations monitoring absorption in the UV/Vis/NIR region.

From Soup: 37 Only monotonous variation in the intensities of these absorption bands was observed as the concentration was increased ( Fig. 2a ), an indication that no significant amount of the intermolecular ( BMV˙ + ) 2 radical dimer is formed under our experimental conditions. On the other hand, the absorption spectra of HV D 6( ˙ +) reveal three prominent bands at 362, 540, and 870 nm, which are the characteristic of ( BIPY˙ + ) 2 radical dimers within the dendritic structure. In particular, the bands of the BIPY˙ + monomer at 395 and 600 nm shifted to shorter wavelengths upon dimerization, in addition to the appearance of a NIR band, which is most likely the result of a through space charge transfer transition. The λ max of these absorption bands remain unperturbed as the concentration is decreased ( Fig. 2b ), an observation that indicates the dimerization process is intramolecular ( β Dim = 7.32 × 10 7 M in MeCN, see Table S1 in ESI † ). Altogether, these results reveal that these materials will always absorb NIR radiation in the context of a smart window, regardless of the concentrations employed.

From Soup: 39 This model system was fully optimized in its oxidized BV 4+ and reduced BV 2( ˙ +) forms. Structure optimizations performed in aqueous solution (IEFPCM model) 28 resulted in a molecular geometry where the two BIPY˙ + units are stacked in a nearly parallel fashion, with the angle between the two least-square planes defined by the BIPY˙ + units amounting to 3.1°, and up to six C⋯C distances in the range of 3.30–3.56 Å. A twist angle of ∼37° is obtained for its fully oxidized form, while two BIPY˙ + fragments show virtually no twisting about their 4,4′-C–C bonds. The diminution in the torsion angle is accompanied by a significant shortening of the 4,4′-C–C distance, which amounts to 1.474 and 1.426 Å in the BV 4+ and BV 2( ˙ +) systems, respectively. This is in line with recent crystallographic studies, in which small torsion angles in BIPY˙ + were considered as a signature of its radical cation nature. 15 Indeed, both SOMO and SOMO-1 in BV 2( ˙ +) show significant overlap (bonding character) between the 4,4′-ring carbon atoms of both BIPY˙ + units. An important delocalization of the SOMO and SOMO-1 ( Fig. 3 ) among the two BIPY˙ + units is also observed.

From Soup: 40 As a proof of principle and in order to evaluate the potential of HV 12+ to serve as an electrochromic material, we constructed a device consisting of two transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes. A concentrated solution of 5.0 mM HV 12+ in 1 M NaCl in H 2 O was sandwiched between two ITO slides under nitrogen . The electrochemistry of the resulting device was investigated in open air employing one of the ITO slides as a working electrode, while the second ITO slide was used as the counter electrode as well as the reference electrode. Fig. 4 depicts the electrochemical properties of HV 12+ in the ITO device. The obtained cyclic voltammograms exhibit wave shapes typical for surface confined redox processes indicating adsorption of the compound onto the electrode surface. 29 The large peak-to-peak separation in the case of the ITO electrode is attributed to the high resistance of the electrode material. Moreover, the prepared device exhibited a reversible and relatively fast 30 color change (up to ten cycles without any significant changes, see ESI † ) from colorless to purple upon reduction as shown in Fig. 4 . The electrochromic property of the device was also examined by UV/Vis/NIR spectroscopy ( Fig. 4 ). Maintaining the voltage at −2 V resulted in absorption spectra similar to that obtained in solution. A large NIR band centred at 1123 nm as well as two absorption bands at 595 and 370 nm characteristic of the dimer formation were observed. The large intensity of the NIR band can be explained by the formation of aggregates on the surface of the ITO slides upon reduction .

From Soup: 41 In summary we have synthesized a new phosphazene–viologen dendrimer ( HV 12+ ) and studied its switching and electrochromic properties. Although dimerization of the viologens is typically hampered in organic solvents (unless at low temperature, or high concentration), the preorganization of the designed dendrimer allows efficient intramolecular dimerization of the two viologens borne by the same phosphorous atom in a wide range of solvents upon reduction leading to a reversible color change (colorless to purple), which was assessed through spectroscopic and electrochemical experiments and supported by theoretical analysis. Taking advantage of its electrochemical properties, i.e. showing a change in the absorption spectrum of HV 12+ by providing external stimuli in the form of electrons, this molecule has been tested for smart window application which was successfully verified through an initial set of experiments. Its ability to absorb in both the UV/Vis and the NIR regions has the potential to limit the heat entering a building and therefore economize energy consumption.

From cou.: 42 As a proof of principle and in order to evaluate the potential of HV12+ to serve as an electrochromic material, we constructed a device consisting of two transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes. A concentrated solution of 5.0 mM HV12+ in 1 M NaCl in H2O was sandwiched between two ITO slides under nitrogen. The electrochemistry of the resulting device was investigated in open air employing one of the ITO slides as a working electrode, while the second ITO slide was used as the counter electrode as well as the reference electrode. Fig. 4 depicts the electrochemical properties of HV12+ in the ITO device. The obtained cyclic voltammograms exhibit wave shapes typical for surface confined redox processes indicating adsorption of the compound onto the electrode surface.29 The large peak-to-peak separation in the case of the ITO electrode is attributed to the high resistance of the electrode material. Moreover, the prepared device exhibited a reversible and relatively fast30 color change (up to ten cycles without any significant changes, see ESI†) from colorless to purple upon reduction as shown in Fig. 4. The electrochromic property of the device was also examined by UV/Vis/NIR spectroscopy (Fig. 4). Maintaining the voltage at −2 V resulted in absorption spectra similar to that obtained in solution. A large NIR band centred at 1123 nm as well as two absorption bands at 595 and 370 nm characteristic of the dimer formation were observed. The large intensity of the NIR band can be explained by the formation of aggregates on the surface of the ITO slides upon reduction.

From cou.: 43 In summary we have synthesized a new phosphazene–viologen dendrimer (HV12+) and studied its switching and electrochromic properties. Although dimerization of the viologens is typically hampered in organic solvents (unless at low temperature, or high concentration), the preorganization of the designed dendrimer allows efficient intramolecular dimerization of the two viologens borne by the same phosphorous atom in a wide range of solvents upon reduction leading to a reversible color change (colorless to purple), which was assessed through spectroscopic and electrochemical experiments and supported by theoretical analysis. Taking advantage of its electrochemical properties, i.e. showing a change in the absorption spectrum of HV12+ by providing external stimuli in the form of electrons, this molecule has been tested for smart window application which was successfully verified through an initial set of experiments. Its ability to absorb in both the UV/Vis and the NIR regions has the potential to limit the heat entering a building and therefore economize energy consumption.
