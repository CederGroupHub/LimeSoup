From cou.: 1 Biophysical phenomena related to cellular biochemistry and transport are spatially and temporally dynamic, and are directly involved in the regulation of physiology at the sub-cellular to tissue spatial scale. Real time monitoring of transmembrane transport provides information about the physiology and viability of cells, tissues, and organisms. Combining information learned from real time transport studies with genomics and proteomics allows us to better understand the functional and mechanistic aspects of cellular and sub-cellular systems. To accomplish this, ultrasensitive sensing technologies are required to probe this functional realm of biological systems with high temporal and spatial resolution. In addition to ongoing research aimed at developing new and enhanced sensors (e.g., increased sensitivity, enhanced analyte selectivity, reduced response time, and novel microfabrication approaches), work over the last few decades has advanced sensor utility through new sensing modalities that extend and enhance the data recorded by sensors. A microsensor technique based on phase sensitive detection of real time biophysical transport is reviewed here. The self-referencing technique converts non-invasive extracellular concentration sensors into dynamic flux sensors for measuring transport from the membrane to the tissue scale. In this tutorial review, we discuss the use of self-referencing micro/nanosensors for measuring physiological activity of living cells/tissues in agricultural, environmental, and biomedical applications comprehensible to any scientist/engineer.

From cou.: 2 Cells utilize a combination of genetic and physiological mechanisms for survival. Membrane transport across organelles (e.g., mitochondria/chloroplast, nucleus) and/or across the outer cell wall regulates growth, metabolism, bioenergetics, stress signaling, immune response, and morphology. Cells contain a diverse array of innate molecular mechanisms capable of sensing extracellular and/or intracellular molecules, and regulate transport mechanisms accordingly. In many ways, physiological transport mechanisms are the primary system which protect the genome from damage. Sensitive and robust technologies are needed which are capable of sensing real time changes in biophysical transport across cell membranes and/or organelles. These technologies must not only be highly sensitive and selective, but must also be minimally invasive and intrusive, enabling real time quantification of cell membrane transport with minimal physical and chemical effect(s) on cell behavior. This broadly defines the motive of physiological sensing, and this review will focus on tools for quantifying real time biophysical transport in the cell, tissue, organ, and whole organism spatial domains. Tools for characterizing morphological phenomena, though equally important, will not be covered.

From cou.: 11 The SR microsensor technique converts static micro/nanosensors with otherwise low signal-to-noise ratios into dynamic flux sensors capable of filtering out signals not associated with biologically active transport. The technique is based on Fick's first law of diffusion (eqn (1)), and uses phase sensitive detection to “self-correct” for signals produced by ambient drift and noise. This is done by oscillating a single micro/nanosensor between two locations using stepper motors.20 The current technique uses a DC coupled move-wait-measure technique for detection of real time changes in differential analyte concentration (ΔC) over a fixed excursion distance (ΔX) (Fig. 1).

From Soup: 36 During operation, computer controlled movement of the sensor induces a phase dependant waveform on the output signal, and amplitude of this signal is proportional to the differential analyte concentration. The signal from the preamplifier head stage is capacitively coupled through a lock-in amplifier to discretely subtract baseline output signal (bath offset) so that the differential waveform can be amplified to digitally analyze differential signals. To avoid capacitive decay in the 0.1–0.5 Hz time domain (leading to an underestimation of the true flux), baseline signals are discretely subtracted (DC coupling) prior to amplification. DC-coupling allows for baseline subtraction without differential signal degradation due to capacitive discharge, allowing calculation of concentration differentials without making assumptions regarding background signals and measurement efficiency. 21

DC-coupling allows for baseline subtraction without differential signal degradation due to capacitive discharge, allowing calculation of concentration differentials without making assumptions regarding background signals and measurement efficiency.21

From Soup: 42 Concentration calibration of micro/nanosensors is conducted using common methods described in the literature. 21,26,37 The major parameters governing SR microsensor efficiency are sensor sensitivity and oscillation frequency. Sensitivity is a function of response time, active surface area, and transduction/acquisition type. Oscillation protocol is a function of size (tip diameter), response time, and the excursion distance (Δ X ) over which the sensor is translated. Prior to use in biological experiments, oscillation frequency must be optimized to maximize sensor translation without inducing stirring. For microsensors with tip diameters in the 800 nm to 5 μm range, the range suggested by Kühtreiber and Jaffe 23 (between 0.20 and 0.50 Hz) is valid. For most cell/tissue transport studies, the thickness of the mass boundary layer formed at the bulk liquid-cell/tissue interface is approximately 50 μm to 1 mm. 32 To fall within the 0.2–0.5 Hz time domain, sensor response time ( t 95 ) should be less than 2.0 s, and the excursion distance should not be larger than approximately 100 μm. As a general rule of thumb, the excursion distance should not be greater than 10% of the thickness of the mass boundary layer (see Fig. 5 for details).

From Soup: 43 To optimize oscillation frequency, abiotic microprofiling experiments are conducted, and compared to simple diffusion-reaction models. A stable abiotic concentration gradient can be produced by mixing a solution containing the target analyte with a dilute polymer solution ( e.g. , ≈1% agar, alginate, sol gel), and injecting the mixture into a glass micropipette. The filled pipette is placed into a bath solution simulating that to be used in the biological experiment, and a concentration gradient allowed to develop near the open tip of the pipette (typically within 20–40 min). A SR microsensor is positioned ≈1 μm from the open micropipette tip using a stepper motor-video zoomscope apparatus. The sensor is oscillated in the direction of transport (perpendicular to the tangent of the pipette tip), and Δ C /Δ X continuously recorded. Flux within the concentration gradient near the pipette tip is profiled, and compared to a simple one or two dimensional empirical diffusion model (the simplest case uses a non-reactive analyte). The correlation between the measured and predicted flux ( ϕ ) is used as a validation of the SR sensor under controlled abiotic conditions. This set of experiments is critical in validating the use of new SR microsensor designs, and it is recommended the correlation between measured and predicted flux is at least 0.90.

From Soup: 48 When characterizing differential signals which are in the sub nV to μV range, temporal concentration drift due to cellular activity can produce erroneous results. 38 For example, if the surface concentration is continuously changing over time, values of Δ C calculated using the C ( x ) minus C ( x +Δ x ) technique ( eqn (2)–(4) ) may produce drift artifacts (positive drift leading to negative differential artifact). In such a case, a simple signal post-processing technique is used. The digital differential filtering (DDF) technique removes signals associated with temporal drift while leaving differential signals intact. The DDF algorithm filters signals every half cycle using eqn (6) , where C ( x ) n is the near pole concentration for measurement cycle n , and C ( x ) n +1 is the near pole concentration for measurement cycle n + 1. 31,35

Abnormalities in Glu signaling are also associated with many illnesses, including schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and cerebral ischemia. 25 Traditional techniques, such as microdialysis and patch clamp for studying Glu release and uptake are limited to concentration measurements (as opposed to flux), require inferences from pharmacological manipulation, and in the case of dialysis , suffer from poor temporal resolution. A Glu biosensor was developed using multiwalled CNTs, gluteraldehyde , bovine serum albumin, Nafion, and Glu oxidase (GlOx). 26 The biosensor measured local Glu release (efflux) and subsequent uptake (influx) near small clusters of neurons and astrocytes in culture following potassium-evoked stimulation ( Fig. 6 ). Prior to stimulation, a basal Glu influx occurred in uninhibited cells, but was absent in the presence of threo -β-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA), which blocks excitatory amino acid transporters. 55 Efflux of Glu took place immediately following stimulation, and was always followed by uptake (which was diffusion limited). In the presence of TBOA, the net glutamate uptake rate and peak amplitude during efflux were significantly lower than in uninhibited cells. The ability to non-invasively monitor rapid, reversible biochemical transport demonstrates how SR Glu biosensors can characterize complex transport events such as neurosignaling. 26

From Soup: 54 IAA, otherwise known as auxin , is an important signaling hormone involved in plant growth/development. Few non-invasive methods exist for determining IAA transport in real time, which is of great value in agricultural research. Use of a SR multiwalled-CNT amperometric sensor for measuring IAA flux was recently shown to be superior to carbon paste electrodes, 56 although use of the sensor in situ required external addition of IAA, which has been shown to inhibit metabolism. 27 We recently improved on this design by the addition of a platinum black layer, and incorporation of DC-coupled amplification. Using the improved microsensor and the iFlux technique (see discussion above), we were able to use SR technique to screen for IAA transport mutants. This is an extremely valuable tool in the agricultural field, as IAA transport “dwarf” mutants require significantly less water than wild type strains. 27 In addition to use as a screening tool, the ultrasensitive microsensor was able to directly measure ultradian oscillations of endogenous IAA transport near the distal elongation zone ( Fig. 7A–B ), which is a highly useful marker for physiological behavior in plants. Empirical harmonic oscillator models were developed and validated using pharmacology, leading to a new conceptual transport model for this well known growth hormone ( Fig. 7C ). 27

From Soup: 55 In addition to platinum wire amperometric sensors, carbon fiber sensors can also be used to measure compounds such as ascorbate 57 and nitric oxide. 58 Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule in mammals and plants, including vasodilation, phagocytic immune response, gravitropism, and oxidative stress. Detection of NO near tissues and cells using electrochemical techniques is difficult due to the instability of the radical once exuded from cell(s). High temporal resolution and the ability to quantify dynamic transport activity make SR a particularly valuable technique for characterizing NO transport. An amperometric NO sensor was constructed using a 5 μm carbon fiber sealed in a glass microcapillary backfilled with a graphite /epoxy paste using a copper wire for electrical contact. 58 The polarization potential, oscillation frequency, and excursion distance for the NO sensor were 300 mV, 0.3 Hz, and 10 μm, respectively. The carbon fiber NO sensor was used to measure NO flux in activated GH3 rat (Wistar-Furth) pituitary tumor cells ( Fig. 8 ). No significant endogenous NO flux was measured prior to stimulation with 25 mM KCl for the cluster of approximately 25 active cells. Following stimulation, cell depolarization activated a signaling pathway which induced NO production by nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Pharmacological inhibition experiments utilized the nNOS inhibitor nitro- L -arginine methyl ester (NLAME), further validating the characterization of real time NO flux using the SR technique. Following stimulation with 25 mM KCl, NO efflux was detected from a cluster of activated rat tumor cells, but no efflux was detected in the presence of the nNOS inhibitor NLAME (1 mM).

Proton efflux was lowest near the root tip, and maximum near the apical meristem/elongation zone approximately 140 μm from the root tip (linearized distance).

From Soup: 59 Most plants can use either ammonium (NH 4 + ) and/or nitrate (NO 3 − ) as a source of nitrogen for cell growth. However, assimilation of NO 3 − in plant roots requires significantly higher metabolic rates than NH 4 + , as NO 3 − must be reduced to nitrite, and then to NH 4 + via nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase, respectively. This metabolic cost concurrently requires increased proton pumping, and electrophysiology studies link NO 3 − and NH 4 + assimilation with trans -plasma membrane H + pumping. 61 Proton efflux was measured using a SRIS electrode in Zea mays roots using NH 4 + and NO 3 − as the sole nitrogen source in hydroponic solutions. The NH 4 + solution contained: 200 μM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 and 100 μM Ca 2 SO 4 ; while the NO 3 − solution contained 200 μM Ca(NO 3 ) 2 and 100 μM Ca 2 SO 4 . Representative data shows the general patterns observed associated with nitrogen metabolism in the corn roots ( Fig. 10 ).

From Soup: 60 Nitrosomonas europaea is a specialized microorganism which is often rate-limiting in the nitrogen cycle, and is commonly found in wastewater treatment plants. N. europaea are responsible for the oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine , and subsequent oxidation to nitrite. This process is catalyzed by membrane bound proteins that include ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase. Oxidation of NH 3 by AMO is often considered the rate limiting metabolic step in nitrification, and inhibition studies aimed at understanding AMO in N. europaea are often conflicting. This is primarily due to the debate as to whether copper is at the active site of AMO (a close cousin, methyl monooxygenase is often used as a model enzyme). Monoculture N. europaea biofilms were grown on silicon membranes, 31 and ammonium flux measured using a NH 4 + -selective SRIS electrode . The electrode was constructed using Ammonium ionophore I (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and 10 mM NH 4 Cl as the electrolyte.

NH 4 + influx significantly decreased following exposure to a copper chelator ( thiourea ) at concentrations as low as 1.5 mM; concentrations above 6.0 mM-thiourea had no additional effect ( Fig. 11 ). This effect was reversed by external addition of CuCl 2 , indicating that thiourea was not binding at the active site, but rather non-competitively coordinating with copper at the enzyme active site. Effluent samples were taken from the flowcell, and analyzed by ion chromatography and a benchtop dissolved oxygen meter, and real time changes in bulk liquid NH 4 + and O 2 were not detected. This is due to the amount of time required for the microbial community to alter the bulk liquid water chemistry, and highlights the importance of using non-invasive ultrasensitive techniques for rapid analysis.

From cou.: 61 Nitrosomonas europaea is a specialized microorganism which is often rate-limiting in the nitrogen cycle, and is commonly found in wastewater treatment plants. N. europaea are responsible for the oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine, and subsequent oxidation to nitrite. This process is catalyzed by membrane bound proteins that include ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase. Oxidation of NH3 by AMO is often considered the rate limiting metabolic step in nitrification, and inhibition studies aimed at understanding AMO in N. europaea are often conflicting. This is primarily due to the debate as to whether copper is at the active site of AMO (a close cousin, methyl monooxygenase is often used as a model enzyme). Monoculture N. europaea biofilms were grown on silicon membranes,31 and ammonium flux measured using a NH4+-selective SRIS electrode. The electrode was constructed using Ammonium ionophore I (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and 10 mM NH4Cl as the electrolyte. The excursion distance was 30 μm, and the oscillation frequency was 0.30 Hz. NH4+ influx significantly decreased following exposure to a copper chelator (thiourea) at concentrations as low as 1.5 mM; concentrations above 6.0 mM-thiourea had no additional effect (Fig. 11).

From Soup: 61 Immediately following damage to the nervous system ( e.g. , severe spinal cord injury), physiological events associated with secondary injury lead to collapse of neuronal function and often cell death. 31,63 During secondary injury, large bioelectric currents enter damaged cells at the injury site due to a difference in potential between injured cell membranes and adjacent intact cell membranes. A significant fraction of the bioelectric current traversing the injury site in spinal cords is composed of calcium ions . 31,63 A SR Ca 2+ -selective microelectrode was constructed using Calcium ionophore I (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and 1 mM CaCl 2 solution as the electrolyte. The excursion distance was 20 μm, and the oscillation frequency was 0.30 Hz. The Ca 2+ -selective SRIS electrode was used to measure calcium influx in the ventral portion of a guinea pig spinal cord ( Fig. 12 ). Influx of extracellular Ca 2+ at the ventral damage site was stable at 2.0 pol cm −2 s −1 for approximately 80 min. The influx of ions following cord damage leads to excessively large changes in cell electrophysiological homeostasis, and is associated with organelle death, distortion, and asymmetry.

From Soup: 64 A SR oxygen optrode was used to measure oxygen influx in a single isolated cancer tumor spheroid ( Fig. 13 ). The oscillation frequency was 0.2 Hz, and the excursion distance was 25 μm. After approximately 45 min of steady state respiration, 5 mM chlorocarbonyl cyanide phenyl-hydrazone (CCCP) was added to the bath solution, causing a significant increase in oxygen influx as the drug disrupted mitochondrial ATP production and proton pumping over the next 20 min. Following establishment of a heightened steady state respiration after addition of CCCP, 1 mM NaN 3 was added to the bath, inhibiting cytochrome oxidase and mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Following external addition of 10 mM NaN 3 , respiration decreased to insignificant levels, followed by cell death. These types of bioenergetic studies provide invaluable information regarding pharmaceutical design and cancer therapies/treatments.

From Soup: 65 Techniques which are capable of real time monitoring of OxPho are also extremely valuable to environmental studies, as there are a number of biodegradable compounds found in the environment which directly effect aerobic respiration. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a chemical commonly found in the environment and has remained in the top 100 of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) priority list of hazardous substances for over two decades. Until 1984, PCP was commonly used as a wood preservative (and is currently used as an industrial preservative). Human illnesses linked to PCP exposure include cancer, endocrine disruption, hepatic effects, and impaired immune function. A Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm was immobilized on a silicon membrane, 32 and a SR oxygen optrode and proton microelectrode were used to monitor aerobic respiration. Following 30 min of steady state oxygen influx (only 2 min are shown in Fig. 14 ), 5 μM PCP was added to the bath solution, and a significant increase in oxygen and proton flux was noted. Since the SR technique was non-invasive, experiments similar to Fig. 14 were repeated a number of times over the course of a six month period without physical damage to the biofilm. Using a battery of parallel techniques we were able to determine that exposure of P. aeruginosa PA01 to PCP causes uncoupling effects, which may be responsible for the shift to anaerobic metabolism; providing insight into the biological mechanisms behind the persistence of PCP in the environment.

From Soup: 66 Flux was continuously measured at the surface of a phytoplankton mat during dark : light cycling 29 to demonstrate the ability to non-invasively monitor O 2 evolution/uptake in plant systems ( Fig. 15A ). To further explore the biochemical pathways involved in photorespiration, 10 μM DCMU was added to the dish with the light on (200 μmol m −2 s −1 ) to inhibit photosynthesis. Following chloroplast inhibition, 1 mM KCN was added to the dish to inhibit mitochondrial activity ( cytochrome pathway). In subsequent experiments, phytoplankton mats were exposed to environmental chemicals thought to effect photorespiration while monitoring O 2 evolution/uptake.

From Soup: 67 A critical biophysical phenomena in many cells involves circadian and ultradain oscillations ( i.e. , the ‘biological clock’). Ultradian oscillations are believed to be due to dynamic regulation of homeostatic/metabolic transport via membrane pumps and channels. Oscillation of ionic transport (Ca 2+ , H + , K + , O 2 ) has been measured using the SR microsensor technique in Zea mays protoplast, 60,65,66 pollen tubes, 67,68 and Olea europaea roots. 66 Oscillatory transport of oxygen at the root tip of 7 day old Glycine max ( Fig. 15B ) had an average period of 3.9 ± 0.3 min. For comparison purposes, a background measurement was taken 3 mm from the root surface, and no oscillations or significant flux was measured. It is not currently clear whether oscillatory transport is regulated by metabolism, homeostasis, or both. Thus, non-invasive techniques such as SR are required to probe the boundary layers formed near living cells to investigate the possible role of this behavior in adaptive response(s) to salinity, temperature, osmotic changes, hypoxia, and pH stresses. 27,29,66

This approach has expedited advancements in the sensing field in terms of materials, biochemistry, electronics, and micro-fabrication. In addition to improving the design of sensors, we introduce a field of research for extending and enhancing sensors by the use of a non-invasive sensing modality designed to directly measure biophysical transport. Self-referencing enhances the functional sensitivity of the sensor by utilizing phase sensitive detection, which in turn significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the biological measurements. The technique has been utilized in a variety of biological applications, and has proven an extremely effective tool for understanding dynamic and complex physiological phenomena. However, the widespread importance of the technique in terms of efficacy and sensitivity is not widely understood within the greater community of biologists who could benefit from the approach, nor from engineers, physicists and chemists in the sensing field. In this tutorial review, we have introduced and reviewed recent advancements in development of the self-referencing technique, and demonstrated microsensor applications to study important physiological problems in agricultural, environmental, biological, and medical sciences.
