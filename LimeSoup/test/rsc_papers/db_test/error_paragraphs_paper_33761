From cou.: 1 To reach the goal of prediction of electrochemical behavior from first principles, it appears increasingly evident that an intermediate stage, between ab initio calculation and Monte Carlo or classical molecular dynamics, will be required. Here we report progress on the development of such an intermediate computational method, using a self consistent tight binding approach, and report some preliminary results on the structure and dynamics of water on the 110 face of rutile titanium dioxide.

From cou.: 2 It is well known that theory and calculation have achieved a quantitatively predictive status in some areas of many body physics and chemistry. For example, structure of simple classical liquids, atomic and nuclear structure of atoms and molecules and some bulk properties of solids are reliably predicted with no more input data than the fundamental constants of nature and the atomic numbers of the constituent atoms. The same cannot be said for any phenomena in electrochemistry. There are several reasons for this. For a long time, one could say that a part of the problem was experimental, because the control of surface quality and the amount of information available was inadequate to fully characterize theoretical models. However this situation is rapidly changing and the experimental constraints are much less formidable than they were. On the side of theory and simulation, advances in computational methods have made it possible to follow the Born–Oppenheimer surface of simple chemical systems of up to a few hundred atoms for times of up to a nanosecond. Unfortunately the constraints mentioned are all significant limitations for an eventual predictive electrochemistry: These ‘direct dynamics’ methods have on the whole been limited to those in which sp electrons are the important ones and the space and time limitations even for such electrochemical systems are significant.

From cou.: 3 For these reasons, we have for the last few years been developing an alternative methodology in which the some features of the advantages of direct dynamics are retained, but the electronic structure is simplified so that the computational constraints are significantly reduced. Our approach, which we call self consistent tight binding molecular dynamics, is designed specifically for the study of electrochemical systems. We set the following criteria: (1) the simplified computational scheme must quantitatively postdict the low energy bulk properties of the constituent electrodes, solvent and ions, (2) the scheme should be capable of modeling transition metal systems and their oxides, (3) for aqueous solvents, the possibility of water dissociation at surfaces should arise naturally. These criteria together with the need to take account of ‘inner shell’ processes such as specific adsorption, essentially require that all the atomic interactions in the model should specifically arise from the simplified electronic structure calculations, which will have to be coulombically self consistent at each step in the atomic dynamics calculations. It is obvious that for chemical predictive capability, the model cannot require reparametrization for each stoichiometry: oxygen, for example, must always be parametrized in the same way, whether it appears in the electrode, the solvent or one of the anions.

From cou.: 4 This is a formidable list of requirements and the present paper will be a progress report. Before describing some details of the approach and some examples of results, we contrast, for orientation, some approaches of other workers to the same problems. We are using a tight binding scheme, which in its general structure traces its ancestry back to the earliest days of quantum mechanics. Unlike many such schemes, we do not calculate any integrals on atomic basis functions in order to determine the parameters of the Hamiltonian. Instead we fit the required parameters to quantitatively predictive ab initio calculations on bulk or molecular properties of the system constituents. These features are similar to the approach of the Naval Research Laboratory tight binding group,1 but their work is not coulomb self consistent, making study of surfaces essentially impossible in their scheme. Our scheme is similar to that of the Frauenheim group,2 which has confined its attention to sp systems, though the approach to self consistency is different in some technical details which may be significant for electrochemistry. In our scheme, we require that the electronic energy level structure of the isolated ions of the constituents is preserved. This is essential for many electrochemical systems and processes and is not commonly present in tight binding schemes. In essence this feature guarantees that features of electron correlation are present in the model. This, for example, has allowed us to predict complex magnetic structures3 in bulk systems which have not, to our knowlege, been obtained by any other method connected to first principles.

From cou.: 5 Our approach to intermediate level modelling should also be contrasted with classical approaches in which one attempts to take account of essential features of charge transfer, coulomb self consistency and atomic dynamics by fitting a classical molecular dynamics model containing charge degrees of freedom. This approach, which aims at simulation at roughly the same time and length scales, has been carried farthest by the Goddard group4 at Cal Tech. As we do, the Goddard group fits its models to first principles calculations on smaller systems. In addition to charge degrees of freedom, multibody force fields are required.

From cou.: 6 A third approach to coupling first principles calculations to calculation of electrochemical properties is to go directly to a lattice Monte Carlo model of the surface properties and attempt to determine the parameters of the Monte Carlo model from first principles calculations. Monte Carlo calculations have the great advantage of quite easily matching electrochemical time scales. The problem with this approach is mainly that a great deal of ‘chemical intuition’ must go into the selection of the model and of the rate limiting steps which it includes. Even if the parameters associated with the chosen steps are determined from first principles (and this has not been done very often), the resulting model has enjoyed a lot of input beyond the atomic numbers and fundamental constants from which we eventually hope to make predictions. Generally, Monte Carlo models do not model the solvent explicitly.

From cou.: 8 To provide a framework for describing the approach we start5 with the general variational principle with respect to the density n(): where E({n()}) is the expectation value of the energy in the ground state. The energy contains three terms, kinetic energy T, a one electron potential energy V1 and the electron–electron coulomb interaction energy V2. These are expressed as Here ρ1(;′) and ρ2(, ′;, ′) are one and two body density matrices defined as in which ΦN(r1,...,rN) is the ground state wave function. (In these expressions, the integrals are meant to include sums over the discrete spin variable.) We express the energy in terms of eigenfunctions ψλ() of the one particle density matrix, expressed as an integral operator: It is not hard to show6 in general that 0≤nλ≤1. Here we assume, as in Hartree–Fock and LDA approximations, that the nλ are either equal to 1 or to 0 and are interpreted as occupation numbers of one electron orbitals. We use a tight binding basis and expand the ψλ() as where ϕi,ν() is orbital ν (the index ν includes a spin designation and the ϕi,ν() is a two component spinor). ϕi,ν() is localized at site i. The ϕi,ν() here are orthonormal, though for the actual numerical implementation we will use a nonorthogonal basis as explained below. The terms T and V1 then become in which in which the spin index σ is written explicitly and The sum can interpreted as the number of electrons at site i.

From cou.: 11 So far, no approximations have been made (assuming that the tight binding basis is complete; in practice we use a limited basis which can only reproduce the exact solutions if matrix elements are chosen appropriately; this has been widely discussed elsewhere, for example in ref. 6.) To approximately treat the term in ρ2 in the energy describing the interactions between electrons, we use the tight binding representation to separate it into an intrasite and intersite part. The intersite part is treated in the Hartree approximation (generalization to the Hartree–Fock approximation is formally straightforward).6 The intrasite part is replaced by the expression ∑iEi(Qi,Si2, {R}) where Ei(Qi,Si2, {R}) is a function of the charge Qi of the ion at ion i, of the square of the total spin Si2=Six2+Siy2+Siz2 of ion i, of the positions {R} of the ions neighboring ion i and of onsite energy parameters which are adjusted to fit positions of the first principles bands. The functions Ei(Qi,Si2, {R}) are chosen so that they describe the behavior of the isolated ions when the neighbors are far away.

From Soup: 37 To model an electrochemical passivation layer we need a model of the underlying metal as well as of the surface oxide . We have applied the approach to modeling titanium metal. Some preliminary reports have previously appeared. 13,14 Further investigation has shown that to get a satisfactory description of both the metal and the relevant oxides one must carry out a simultaneous fit to a variety of bulk materials to the corresponding first principles calculations. We carried out such a simultaneous fit to rutile titania, TiO and fcc, hcp and bcc titanium. We show these previously unpublished results in Fig. 3 . The fit to the rutile titania cohesive energy is somewhat inferior to that obtained for rutile titania alone in ref. 7 but the structure seems satisfactory.

From Soup: 38 To begin modeling metal/passivation layer structures we constructed 14 a titanium oxide/titanium interface model. We have shown that oxygen vacancies are stable in this model passivation layer. (This requires inclusion of s and p orbitals in the electronic structure model which are not needed in the model for pure titania.) In future we will be studying the transport and equilibrium properties of electronic and point defects in this model, with the goal of evaluating models such as that of MacDonald for the passivation layer. We showed 15 that electrons in this model of titania are small polarons at finite temperature.

From cou.: 39 σ
From Soup: 39 For the present, we confine attention to aqueous solvent . For study of water / oxide interfaces, there is evidence that water dissociates at some low index surfaces. There is, for example, a continuing debate concerning whether this occurs on the 110 surface of rutile titania. 16 In any case, it is clear that the solvent must be modelled as dissociable water . This is a notoriously difficult problem. 17 In ongoing work, we are developing a dissociable self-consistent tight binding model of water for use in electrochemical contexts. Instead of using the LDA calculations of bulk solids as a benchmark, as we did in the modeling of metals and oxides , here we are using calculations of the properties of small water clusters which were obtained using high levels of quantum chemical theory. Some results for the single molecule are shown in Fig. 4 . Preliminary results for the structure of liquid water (on a sample of 12 water molecules, periodically continued) appear in Fig. 5 . These data are encouragingly similar to the known structure of liquid water .

From Soup: 40 Using this same model of water , we have relaxed two configurations of a monolayer of water on the 110 surface of TiO 2 as shown in Figs. 6 and 7 . These structures are fully relaxed. We find, without further adjustment of our tight binding model parameters, that the configuration in which the water is dissociated is lower in energy than the undissociated configuration by about 0.6 eV per water molecule. The relaxed structures are very similar to those found by Goniakowski and Gillan using first principles methods. 16 They also found that the dissociated configuration was lower in energy, though by 0.28 eV, a factor of 2 less than our result. In fact, we find this encouraging in view of the relative simplicity of the model. The parameters of the water model will undergo further refinement as we improve the fit to first principles data on water clusters.

From Soup: 41 To get some idea of what may be possible, we have also simulated a single water molecule on the 110 face of rutile titania using these parameters in a molecular dynamics simulation. We show a preliminary result in Fig. 8 . In this simulation, the average kinetic energy of the atoms was held at 500 K. The water molecule began in the same position which the water molecules had in Fig. 6 . The picture was made after only 1 fs of molecular dynamics simulation. It appears that the water molecule at the top of the picture is dissociating, consistent with a very low barrier for transition to a more stable dissociated state like that in Fig. 7 (but for one molecule, not a row of molecules.) This simulation is still running but it appears that, by starting with molecular water , we will be able to study the process of dissociation at the surface.

From Soup: 42 We believe that these methods show promise of bridging the simulation gap between very small systems which can be treated nearly exactly, and the very large models which are appropriately treated by macroscopic continuum or Monte Carlo models. The phenomena which we hope to study in the near future with these methods include the dissociation of water at the titanium dioxide 110 surface as well as the energetics of oxygen vacancy transport across a passivation layer under various conditions. In collaboration with Peter Zapol, working with Larry Curtiss at Argonne National Laboratory, we are using these codes to study anatase nanocrystals of interest in structures in which biomolecules are attached to the crystals in order to probe them optically. We have constructed a self consistent tight binding model for copper metal and for copper surfaces and plan to use it to study the effect of adsorbed chloride on electron transfer at these surfaces. In the farther future we plan studies of the effects of oxide grain boundaries on electron, hole and defect transport in oxides characteristic of the passivation layer on metal surfaces.

From cou.: 50 We believe that these methods show promise of bridging the simulation gap between very small systems which can be treated nearly exactly, and the very large models which are appropriately treated by macroscopic continuum or Monte Carlo models. The phenomena which we hope to study in the near future with these methods include the dissociation of water at the titanium dioxide 110 surface as well as the energetics of oxygen vacancy transport across a passivation layer under various conditions. In collaboration with Peter Zapol, working with Larry Curtiss at Argonne National Laboratory, we are using these codes to study anatase nanocrystals of interest in structures in which biomolecules are attached to the crystals in order to probe them optically. We have constructed a self consistent tight binding model for copper metal and for copper surfaces and plan to use it to study the effect of adsorbed chloride on electron transfer at these surfaces. In the farther future we plan studies of the effects of oxide grain boundaries on electron, hole and defect transport in oxides characteristic of the passivation layer on metal surfaces.

From Soup: 61 can be interpreted as the three components of the spin at site . assuming in the Hartree and exchange integrals that overlaps between the localized orbitals on different sites can be neglected and explicitly displaying the part of the Hartree term which arises from the monopole–monopole terms in a moment expansion of the Hartree potential. Some of the higher order multipole terms arising from expansion of the Hartree energy in a multipole series are also included in exactly as it was done in . is fit to the atomic ionization potentials and (many electron) energy levels so that it contains information on on-site Hund's rule correlations and exchange interactions. The environmental terms are taken to have form where refers to the shell and is the number of electrons in shell of ion . The shells correspond to the orbital basis chosen for the tight binding model. Quite recently, we have adopted the same functional form for parametrizing the hopping integrals as well as the overlap integrals (in a nonorthogonal basis). in which Here on the line means +1 if the subscript is ↑ and on the line means −1 if the subscript is ↓. This is different from the definition used in our previous publications but very common in other people's work and it simplifies the calculation of atomic forces without affecting the results significantly.
