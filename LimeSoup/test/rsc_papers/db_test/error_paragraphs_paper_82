From cou.: 1 Correction for ‘Dynamic ruffling distortion of the heme substrate in non-canonical heme oxygenase enzymes’ by Amanda B. Graves et al., Dalton Trans., 2016, 45, 10058–10067.
From Soup: 1 The authors regret a unit conversion error in panel C of Fig. 5 , which has been corrected below. The initial slope of the 2 K VTVH MCD saturation magnetization curve for WT MhuD–heme–CN is less than that of F23W MhuD–heme–CN. This correction does not affect the discussion or conclusions of the original article.
