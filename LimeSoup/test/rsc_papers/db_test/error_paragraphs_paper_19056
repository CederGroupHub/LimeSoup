From cou.: 1 Quantum spin-dependent transport in a ferromagnetic(FM)/DNA/ferromagnetic(FM) device is theoretically investigated based on the lattice Green function method and the Landauer–Büttiker theory. The effect of a transverse electric field on magnetoresistance (MR) of the device is investigated. It is predicted that either the direction or strength of the transverse electric field can change the MR of the device. We suggest a possible application of modulating MR of the FM/DNA/FM device by a transverse electric field.

From cou.: 2 Magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) is extremely important for magnetic device application. Conventional MTJ sandwiches a thin nonmagnetic material between two ferromagnetic metals.1 The electric resistance of MTJ is sensitive to the relative magnetization of the ferromagnetic electrodes which results magnetoresistance. It is possible to change the resistance by controlling the magnetizations direction of the ferromagnetic electrodes through an external magnetic field.2 Organic materials have the advantage of weak spin–orbit and hyperfine interactions, which preserve spin-coherence over times and distances much longer than that in conventional metals or semiconductors. Such features make them suitable materials for spin injection and transport. Tsukagoshi et al.3 reported the injection of spin-polarized electrons from ferromagnetic electrodes into multi-walled carbon nanotubes. They observed a magnetoresistance in several nanotubes with a maximum resistance change of 9%. Xiong et al.4 designed the LSMO/Alq3/Co device and reported a magnetoresistance as high as 40%. Dediu et al.5 reported sexithienyl (T6) contacted by LSMO electrodes showing a strong magnetoresistance up to 30%. Petta et al.6 fabricated MTJ of octanethiol contacted by Ni and found a magnetoresistance up to 16%. Theoretically, for instance, Mehrez et al.7 used a tight binding model and investigated spin-coherent quantum transport in a single-wall carbon nanotube MTJ. Their calculation showed a magnetoresistance as large as 20% at low temperature. Waldron et al.8 studied quantum spin transport through a Ni-benzenedithiol (BDT)-Ni molecular MTJ. They took into account microscopic details based on the density functional theory and obtained magnetoresistance as large as 27%.

From cou.: 3 DNA is a promising candidate for molecular electronics because of its unique self-assembling and self-recognition properties which are essential for its performance as carrier of the genetic code. Its double stranded helix structure was discovered by Watson and Crick in 1953. As early as 1962, Eley and Spivey9 suggested that the interbase hybridization of πz orbitals perpendicular to the planes of the stacked base pairs in double-stranded DNA could lead to conducting behavior. Recently, many direct charge transport experiments have obtained the current–voltage characteristics of the device by contacting DNA molecules between two electrodes.10–17 Theoretically, Berlin et al.18–22 studied the charge transport mechanism in DNA. Grozema et al.23–25 used a tight binding approach to study the length and sequence dependence of the charge migration rate in DNA. The first principle density functional theory is also used to study DNA electronics.26–29 Although there exists some controversy about the conductivity of DNA, it is believed that DNA with artificially created periodic sequence, for example, such as the poly(A)-poly(T) or poly(G)-poly(C) DNA, can be a good candidate for a nanostructure device in suitable temperature, substrate and humidity environment.30

From cou.: 4 DNA is also used to explore the quantum spin transport. Zwolak and Ventra31 first showed that a DNA spin valve can be realized. They studied the DNA molecule contacted with Ni and Fe electrodes. They showed that magnetoresistance values of as much as 26% for Ni and 16% for Fe electrodes can be observed. They suggested the larger magnetoresistance for the Ni electrodes than for Fe ones is due to the larger mismatch between spin-up and spin-down Fermi velocities of Ni with respect to Fe. Wang and Chakraborty further studied the spin flip effect on spin transport in a DNA molecule.32 They found an enhancement of magnetoresistance for a weak spin flip coupling while an oscillatory behavior for a strong spin flip coupling. Recently, another interesting phenomenon was reported based on a poly(G)-poly(C) DNA device. When a perpendicular electric field is applied on a DNA molecule, Malyshev33 predicted that the charge current through the molecule will be suppressed. The reason is that transverse electric field induces change of the electronic structure of a DNA molecule, which results in an adjustable conducting tunneling along the double stranded helix.

From Soup: 87 The parameters are set as follows in this paper. For a poly(G)-poly(C) DNA molecule, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is taken as on-site energies: 33 ε G = 1.14 eV and ε C = −1.06 eV. The hopping integral is set as 34 t G ( C ) = 0.3 eV and t ⊥ = 0.1 eV, which are within reasonable parameter intervals. 35 We choose a typical tight-binding parameter for the ferromagnetic electrodes: 39 τ = 1.5 eV and J = 1.5 eV. The Fermi level of the electrodes is supposed to be at the middle of the DNA band gap. Interfacial couplings are supposed to be spin independent and set to be 0.02 eV, which is consistent with other theoretical works to fit the experimental I – V curves. 11 A low temperature of T = 30 K is applied in this work.

From Soup: 88 We firstly investigate a one-helix-period poly(G)-poly(C) DNA which consists of 11-base pairs. Fig. 1 shows the current–voltage characteristics of the device for parallel (P) and antiparallel (AP) alignment of the magnetization of electrodes. The magnetoresistance is defined as MR = ( I P − I AP )/ I P . The inset in Fig. 1 is the corresponding dependence of magnetoresistance on applied bias. MR of the device increases from 3.1% at 1.2 V to 25.3% at 4 V. The result is consistent with that of ref. 31 . It should be mentioned that in ref. 31 the magnetization of the electrodes is characterized by the different hopping integral for majority and minority electrons, while here we describe the magnetization of the electrodes with different on-site energies. 39,40 There should be no qualitative difference for the final conclusion.

From cou.: 89 I
From Soup: 89 When a transverse electric field is applied, the potential along the DNA chain will be adjusted due to the spacial structure of a DNA double helix. This modulation changes the electronic structure of the DNA molecule and further influences its transport property. Ref. 33 has predicted that a transverse electric field will suppress the current through the device. The reason is that the transverse electric field potential tends to make the on-site energy of the poly(G)-poly(C) DNA molecule into a “disorder”. This “disorder” changes the wave-function of the electron and further influences conductivity. Our calculation reveals that the suppression on the current is also related to the direction of the transverse electric field, which is denoted by phase φ 0 , as shown in Fig. 3 . Since the modulation is harmonic due to the double helix structure of DNA molecule, we choose the phase φ 0 = 0 to correspond to the direction that the transverse electric field points to from base G to base C of the first base pair. The modulated potential along a one-helix-period ploy(G)-poly(C) DNA G and C chain is shown in Fig. 2 for phase φ 0 = 0 and φ 0 = π. At a fixed strength of the transverse electric field the amplitude of the “disorder” is unchanged, but different directions change the shape of the modulation in detail, which will make a difference of the conductance. For a simple metal/DNA/metal device, Fig. 3 shows the dependence of the current on φ 0 for different strengths of the transverse electric field. The straight solid line corresponds to the case when the transverse electric field is absent. When the transverse electric field is turned on, the current has fluctuating behavior with φ 0 . With a larger transverse electric field fluctuation becomes more notable.

From cou.: 90 The parameters are set as follows in this paper. For a poly(G)-poly(C) DNA molecule, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is taken as on-site energies:33εG = 1.14 eV and εC = −1.06 eV. The hopping integral is set as34tG(C) = 0.3 eV and t⊥ = 0.1 eV, which are within reasonable parameter intervals.35 We choose a typical tight-binding parameter for the ferromagnetic electrodes:39τ = 1.5 eV and J = 1.5 eV. The Fermi level of the electrodes is supposed to be at the middle of the DNA band gap. Interfacial couplings are supposed to be spin independent and set to be 0.02 eV, which is consistent with other theoretical works to fit the experimental I–V curves.11 A low temperature of T = 30 K is applied in this work.
From Soup: 90 Then for a FM/DNA/FM device, we apply a transverse electric field and calculate MR of the device. The upper panel in Fig. 4 shows that the MR at V T = 0.4 V. The dashed line is a result of V T = 0 V, which gives a MR of 25.3% in the present parameters. The lower panel in Fig. 4 shows the corresponding dependence of the current on φ 0 corresponding to the P (solid line) and AP (dashed line) alignment of magnetization of the electrodes. It is found that the direction of the transverse electric field has a remarkable modulation to MR of the FM/DNA/FM device. MR can reach larger values at some special directions of the transverse electric field. To facilitate handling of the figures, we chose the reference point φ 0 = 0 as the symmetrical point of the DNA molecule, which corresponds to the direction that the transverse electric field points to from base G to base C of the first base pair. Departing from the symmetrical point, both the P and AP currents will be decreasing. At φ 0 = 0, we obtain the current I P = 9.93 nA, I AP = 8.57 nA, which gives . For a small departure, for example, φ 0 = 0.1π = 0.314, we obtain I P = 7.93 nA, I AP = 6.62 nA, which gives MR = 16.5%. The exact reason for the increasing of MR is complex as both I P and I AP will change with the direction of the field. A qualitative understanding may be that, with the change of the field direction, the conducting tunnels tend to move out of the conducting window in both P and AP configurations. We hope that more tunnels move into the conducting window in the P configuration and fewer tunnels do so in the AP one to get a higher MR. This case seems to appear with a suitable adjustment of the electric field direction. As shown in Fig. 3 , at φ 0 = π we obtain a MR of the device as high as 42.5%.

From cou.: 91 We firstly investigate a one-helix-period poly(G)-poly(C) DNA which consists of 11-base pairs. Fig. 1 shows the current–voltage characteristics of the device for parallel (P) and antiparallel (AP) alignment of the magnetization of electrodes. The magnetoresistance is defined as MR = (IP−IAP)/IP. The inset in Fig. 1 is the corresponding dependence of magnetoresistance on applied bias. MR of the device increases from 3.1% at 1.2 V to 25.3% at 4 V. The result is consistent with that of ref. 31. It should be mentioned that in ref. 31 the magnetization of the electrodes is characterized by the different hopping integral for majority and minority electrons, while here we describe the magnetization of the electrodes with different on-site energies.39,40 There should be no qualitative difference for the final conclusion.
From Soup: 91 As the enhancement of MR is the largest at φ 0 = π in the present case, we calculate the dependence of MR on the strength of the transverse electric field by fixing φ 0 = π, The result is shown in Fig. 5(a) . The corresponding current with parallel (solid line) and antiparallel (dashed line) alignment of magnetization of electrodes is shown in Fig. 5(b) . Both P and AP currents decrease with the increase of the transverse electric field and approach zero when the strength of the field is larger than 2 V, which means that the current may be blocked by a strong transverse electric field. However, if we check the MR, it is found that it first increases with the transverse electric field. At about V T = 1.1 V the MR reaches a maximum value as high as 83%. A MR of 83% is indeed abnormal. We note that at this point the current I P = 4.04 nA, while I AP = 0.69 nA. The current in the AP configuration is much less than that in the P configuration, therefore a large MR is expected. By the way, some experimental works also reported a high MR in the MTJ structure. For example, in one of the recent experiments, 41 the MR of Co/MgO/Co MTJ structure reaches as high as 507% (which equals 83.5% in our definition). Some theoretical work 42 also predicted a high MR (over 90% in our definition) in a MTJ structure.

The straight solid line corresponds to the case when the transverse electric field is absent. When the transverse electric field is turned on, the current has fluctuating behavior with φ0. With a larger transverse electric field fluctuation becomes more notable.
From Soup: 92 It should be pointed out that the spin flip effect is not considered in our calculation. The spin flip can be the result of an electron–phonon interaction, a magnetic impurity in the backbone or an interface mismatch between the ferromagnetic electrode and DNA molecule. It is found that the spin flip effect plays the role of suppressing the MR of the MTJ. 43–45 However Wang and Chakraborty found an enhanced MR when the spin flip is weak for short DNA connected with Fe electrodes. 32

From Soup: 93 We have performed a theoretical study of the quantum spin transport in a FM/DNA/FM device based on the lattice Green function method and the Landauer-Büttiker theory. We explore a possible usage of a transverse electric field for enhancing the magnetoresistance of the FM/DNA/FM device. It is found the direction and strength of the transverse electric field will induce a modulation in the MR. The MR of the device can be enhanced at some special direction and strength of the transverse electric field. This enhancement of MR is related to the electronic structure change induced by the transverse electric field, which is a peculiar characteristics of a DNA device.
 ###### 
From cou.: 94 As the enhancement of MR is the largest at φ0 = π in the present case, we calculate the dependence of MR on the strength of the transverse electric field by fixing φ0 = π, The result is shown in Fig. 5(a). The corresponding current with parallel (solid line) and antiparallel (dashed line) alignment of magnetization of electrodes is shown in Fig. 5(b). Both P and AP currents decrease with the increase of the transverse electric field and approach zero when the strength of the field is larger than 2 V, which means that the current may be blocked by a strong transverse electric field. However, if we check the MR, it is found that it first increases with the transverse electric field. At about VT = 1.1 V the MR reaches a maximum value as high as 83%. A MR of 83% is indeed abnormal. We note that at this point the current IP = 4.04 nA, while IAP = 0.69 nA. The current in the AP configuration is much less than that in the P configuration, therefore a large MR is expected. By the way, some experimental works also reported a high MR in the MTJ structure. For example, in one of the recent experiments,41 the MR of Co/MgO/Co MTJ structure reaches as high as 507% (which equals 83.5% in our definition). Some theoretical work42 also predicted a high MR (over 90% in our definition) in a MTJ structure.

From cou.: 95 It should be pointed out that the spin flip effect is not considered in our calculation. The spin flip can be the result of an electron–phonon interaction, a magnetic impurity in the backbone or an interface mismatch between the ferromagnetic electrode and DNA molecule. It is found that the spin flip effect plays the role of suppressing the MR of the MTJ.43–45 However Wang and Chakraborty found an enhanced MR when the spin flip is weak for short DNA connected with Fe electrodes.32

From cou.: 96 We have performed a theoretical study of the quantum spin transport in a FM/DNA/FM device based on the lattice Green function method and the Landauer-Büttiker theory. We explore a possible usage of a transverse electric field for enhancing the magnetoresistance of the FM/DNA/FM device. It is found the direction and strength of the transverse electric field will induce a modulation in the MR. The MR of the device can be enhanced at some special direction and strength of the transverse electric field. This enhancement of MR is related to the electronic structure change induced by the transverse electric field, which is a peculiar characteristics of a DNA device.
