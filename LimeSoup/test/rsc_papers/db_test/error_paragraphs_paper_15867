From cou.: 1 Three novel copper(II) 2-nitrobenzoate complexes, [Cu(γ-pic)2(2-nitrobenzoate)2] 1, [Cu(β-pic)2(2-nitrobenzoate)2(H2O)2] 2 and [Cu2(H2tea)2(2-nitrobenzoate)2]·2(H2O) 3 (where γ-pic = 4-methylpyridine, β-pic = 3-methylpyridine and H2tea = mono deprotonated triethanolamine), were isolated by addition of γ-pic, β-pic and H3tea to the hydrated copper(II) 2-nitrobenzoate, [Cu2(2-nitrobenzoate)4(H2O)2]·2H2O, suspended in a methanol:water (4:1) mixture. The newly synthesized complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), spectroscopic techniques (EPR, IR and UV/Visible), magnetic susceptibility measurements, single crystal X-ray structure determination and DFT study. All compounds crystallize in the monoclinic crystal system with the P21/c space group. X-ray structure determination revealed the presence of monomers in both 1 and 2 and dimer in 3 with the deprotonated oxygen atom of the H2tea ligand bridging two Cu(II) atoms. Two co-crystallized water molecules are also present in 3. The crystal lattice is stabilized by C–H⋯O hydrogen bonding interactions in 1 and O–H⋯O, C–H⋯O hydrogen bonding interactions in 2 and 3. The dimeric complex exhibits relatively strong ferromagnetic exchange with J = −100 cm−1 (corresponding to H = JS1S2). The zero-field splitting parameters (zfs) of the dimer triplet states D and E were derived from HF EPR spectra recorded at moderately low temperatures. The sign of D was determined from low-temperature HF EPR spectra.

From cou.: 2 In recent years, crystal engineering based on organic and/or inorganic molecular building blocks has been rapidly expanding owing to the novel and diverse topologies and potential applications in host–guest chemistry, catalysis, electrical conductivity and magnetism.1–6 One of the important strategies is to establish the likely connections between organic and/or inorganic molecular building blocks by exploiting non-covalent interactions.7,8 In the case of transition metal complexes, these interactions are established mainly among the ‘organic’ parts of the molecules, and can be modulated through a suitable choice of the ligands. Copper(II) complexes are among the most widely studied coordination compounds because of their wide range of applications,9–15 in particular when the ligands are alkyl/aryl carboxylate anions, which can exhibit a wide variety of coordination modes (monodentate, symmetric\asymmetric chelating, and bidentate\monodentate bridging). Moreover, properties of copper(II) carboxylates and the coordination abilities of carboxylate ions can be varied to a large extent using nitrogen donor ligands with appropriate functionalization.16–19 A combined stereo-electronic effect that emerges as a result of both the carboxylate anion and the ancillary N-donor ligand would dictate the final nature and structure of the complex formed. That is, in a nutshell, the chosen carboxylate ligand may show a propensity to exhibit different coordination modes depending upon the type of N-donor ligand chosen.

From cou.: 3 In this direction, with the aim of comparing the structural and packing features of complexes in which different N-donor ligands participate, we have chosen two very similar nitrogen-donor ligands γ-pic (4-methyl pyridine) and β-pic (3-methyl pyridine) which are rigid in their molecular topology along with a third N-donor ligand triethanolamine (H3tea) which is highly flexible in terms of molecular conformation. This ligand after deprotonation (i.e. H2tea) will be endowed with two –OH groups which may take part either singly or in a combined way in the hydrogen bonding as effective proton donors. In addition, a theoretical approach that can model these structures and their bonding features would be rewarding. Thus, this paper reports the synthesis, characterization and DFT study of three novel copper(II) complexes with different nitrogen donor ligands, [Cu(γ-pic)2(2-nitrobenzoate)2] (1), [Cu(β-pic)2(2-nitrobenzoate)·2(H2O)2] (2) and [Cu2(H2tea)2(2-nitrobenzoate)2]·2(H2O) (3).

From cou.: 4 Particular attention has been devoted to complex 3 where the presence of the H2tea ligand favours the formation of a dinuclear molecule in which two Cu atoms are bridged by two oxygen atoms. In general, the magnetic behavior of transition metal complexes containing more than one metal atom with unpaired electrons is affected by the metal–metal interaction. The case discussed in this paper is that of weakly interacting metal ions (with the Cu…Cu distance in the range 3–5 Å), where the coupling between their electrons leads to low-lying excited states of different spin which can be thermally populated. The resulting magnetic behavior can be antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic, and the ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic coupling is strictly related to structural parameters such as the Cu–O–Cu angle and the Cu⋯Cu distance. Accordingly, the magnetic characterization of 3 has been performed both from a theoretical and experimental point of view.

From cou.: 22 ORCA software30 was used to perform the “broken symmetry” DFT calculations of exchange parameters J for 3. All atoms were retained at the positions determined by the X-ray structures. The “broken symmetry” procedure applied to a dimeric copper(II) complex first performs a Self-Consistent Field (SCF) calculation for a high-spin molecule (HS) with the spin equal to 1. In the next stage, another SCF calculation is performed taking the spin on one Cu atom ‘up’ and ‘down’ on another, which is referred to as the broken symmetry state (BS). Finally, the magnitude of J (for the spin Hamiltonian 1) is evaluated as J = 2(EHS − EBS)/(〈S2〉HS − 〈S2〉BS), where E are the energies and 〈S〉2 are the expectation values of the spin-squared operator in the HS and BS states.

Finally, the magnitude of J (for the spin Hamiltonian 1) is evaluated as J = 2( E HS − E BS )/(〈 S 2 〉 HS − 〈 S 2 〉 BS ), where E are the energies and 〈 S 〉 2 are the expectation values of the spin-squared operator in the HS and BS states.

From cou.: 26 Relevant geometrical parameters are reported in Table 2. In 1 and 2, the Cu atom lies on an inversion center, while in 3 a symmetry center is positioned just in the middle of the binuclear complex. In both 1 and 2 complexes, the Cu atom is linked to two picoline and two monodentate benzoate ligands, bonded via O1. In addition, it is involved in two further second-order interactions, giving a final (4 + 2) coordination: in 1 the carboxylic oxygens (O2) are at a Cu–O distance of 2.518(1) Å, while in 2 two centrosymmetrically related water molecules are at a distance of 2.739(2) Å (Table 2). The angles formed by the O2–Cu1 and O1w–Cu1 lines with the normal to mean basal planes measure 32.60(4) and 6.08(7)° in 1 and 2, respectively. Complex 3 is dimeric with the de-protonated oxygen atom of the H2tea ligand forming a bridge between two centrosymmetrically related Cu(II) atoms. The coordination geometry of 3 can be described, in analogy with those reported in the literature for analogous Cu(II) benzoate,35 3-chlorobenzoate36 and 4-methylbenzoate37 complexes, as distorted tetragonal bipyramidal (or highly distorted octahedral), with each H2tea molecule acting as a tetradentate ligand or as square-planar with two additional interactions like in 1 and 2.

From cou.: 27 Actually, the equatorial plane in 3 is defined by one carboxylate oxygen atom of 2-nitrobenzoate, two bridging alkoxo oxygen atoms and one nitrogen while O2 and O3 atoms of H2tea are located at much longer distances (Table 2); the Cu atom is displaced by 0.023 Å from the least-square plane passing through (O1, N1, O4) and the angles formed by Cu1–O2 and Cu1–O3 lines with the normal to this plane are 16.44(9) and 11.19(8)°, respectively. For each dimeric moiety, two water molecules of crystallization are present in the crystal.

From cou.: 28 The Cu–N distances are similar in all the three complexes and do not show any significant discrepancy from structural parameters of related Cu compounds. The Cu–O distances display a wide range of values, from 1.934(2) Å (oxo-bridge, complex 3) to 2.739(2) Å (water molecule, complex 2), that can be more appropriately considered as a contact distance. The histogram of the Cu–O(benzoate) distances, obtained from a search on the CSD database (278 hits) considering both the oxygens linked to the metal, is clearly bimodal showing two distinct bond length distributions around 2.0 and 2.6 Å, respectively, in perfect agreement with the structural data of 1 and 3. Moreover, Fig. 4, obtained by the same CSD search, suggests that these two distances are intercorrelated; if one increases, the other decreases. Geometrical data of complex 1 (red point) are perfectly in line with the others. The points enclosed in a circle, which do not follow the curve trend, refer to particular structures: of polymeric type, with huge ligands, or having Cl− anions as ligands.

From cou.: 29 As far as the binuclear complex 3 is concerned, a comparison with the similar Cu–H2tea complexes above mentioned35–37 shows that the molecular arrangement around the Cu atoms and the geometrical parameters are strictly comparable in all of them; benzoates are acting as monodentate ligands, with the oxygen of anionic H2tea bridging two metals, and one OH group of the H2tea being involved in an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the free benzoate oxygen. Moreover, two cocrystallized water molecules for each binuclear complex are always present connecting different molecules in exactly the same way as in complex 3 (vide infra), suggesting that in these structures, the presence of water is essential for the robustness of the crystalline framework.

From cou.: 30 It is interesting to note that complexes 1 and 2 present a different Cu environment in spite of having almost identical ligands (p-methyl and o-methyl pyridine, respectively). In order to explore whether the choice of different picoline molecules can affect the possibility of water inclusion in the first or the second coordination sphere, the equilibrium geometry of both complexes has been obtained by DFT calculations starting from the same initial point, i.e. by adding two Cu-coordinated water molecules to the picoline/benzoate skeleton at a distance of 2.40 Å or using an initial geometry with no coordinated water molecules. The results are reported in Fig. 5. For the diaquo complexes, the Cu–O, Cu–N distances are strictly comparable and the energies of the calculated molecules are practically identical: the γ-picoline complex is more stable than the β-picoline one by 0.36 kcal mol−1. The same results have been obtained for complexes without water, but in this case the γ-picoline compound is more stable by 2.13 kcal mol−1; this extra-stability is however not sufficient to explain the different coordination of the two compounds, which probably depends mostly on the solvent used (or in general on the crystallization conditions).

From cou.: 31 As mentioned at the outset, one of our objectives was to delineate the variation/change in the conformation of the carboxylate ligand upon the addition of three different N-donor ligands, two rigid (picolines) and one flexible (H3tea). Indeed, as anticipated, the –NO2 moiety is out of plane from the aromatic ring in all three, but the extent of variation is quite large, ranging from 42.4(3), 53.9(3) and 81.6(4)° for 1, 2 and 3 respectively (note that this variation is highest with the most flexible N-donor ligand H3tea).

 ###### 
From cou.: 32 In an analogous manner, the –COO− moiety also gets rotated with respect to the aromatic plane, the highest rotation being observed in 1 and 2 (42.6(2) and 42.3(3)°) and almost in-plane of the aromatic ring in 3 (5.2(2)°). Here also that distinction prevails; the rigid N-donor ligands are similar in behavior and the flexible one shows considerable deviation. It is clear that each of these structures would try to maximize the resonance energy by keeping both –NO2 and –COO groups in plane with the aromatic ring, but the opposing steric repulsion needs to be compensated by allowing them to move away from the plane to the extent that the lattice energy is minimum (most stable arrangement). Thus, in the most flexible deprotonated ligand H2tea (3) –COO− is only few degrees away from the plane, but at the same time the –NO2 is almost orthogonal. In the rigid N-donors 1 and 2 the situation is in between, both the groups deviate to the extent of some 45°. These findings are supported by the survey of the conformation of the nitrobenzoate moiety in Cu complexes with N-donor ligands already present in literature. 21 structures of this type were found in the CSD; for each of them the NO2− and COO− out-of-plane was evaluated through the measure of the torsion angles O1–N–C1–C2 and O2–C3–C2–C1 (see Fig. 6). As shown in the plot, the two angles are strongly intercorrelated in the same way as found for the present complexes; the COO− group is rarely coplanar with the phenyl moiety, and this happens when both the oxygens are ‘busy’ in covalent or strong H-bonding interactions within a same molecular complex, in which the Cu atom is linked to small or highly conformationally adaptable N-donor ligands.

From cou.: 33 This observation becomes interesting when we consider the mode of coordination in 1, 2 and 3. In 1, the carboxylate group is monodentate but the second oxygen is still interacting with the Cu atom, (Table 2) whereas in 2 one of the Cu–O distance becomes so large (3.185(2) Å) that the coordination is obviously monodentate and it is much higher yet in 3 (3.378(3) Å). That is, the nature of the N-donor ligand definitely exerts influence on the coordination mode and this in turn affects the structure and the packing architecture of the crystallized complex.

From cou.: 34 The hydrogen bonding structural parameters for the three complexes are reported in Table 3. In 1, the presence of a number of good hydrogen bonding acceptors but a lack of good hydrogen bonding donors allows only the formation of C–H⋯O bonds. The C–H⋯O1 contact on the two sides of the molecule generates ribbons linking the complexes along the c direction. These ribbons are in turn connected along the b direction through C–H⋯O2 interactions. Conversely, in 2 and 3 the presence of water molecules or hydroxyl groups leads to strong O–H⋯O interactions, both intermolecular and intramolecular. In 2, the coordinated water molecules, besides being involved in intramolecular interactions, act as H-bond donors towards the O2 atoms of an adjacent molecule, giving rise to the R22(12) ring as shown in Fig. 7.

From cou.: 35 The resulting overall packing is made of parallel ribbons running along the a direction. In 3, the interaction network is somewhat similar but more complex than 2 due to the presence of a large number of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups. Water molecules of crystallization act as linkers by bridging the adjacent molecules; they behave as hydrogen bond donors towards O1 and O2 atoms and as acceptors to the O3 atom. This results in formation of molecular ribbons running along the a direction (Fig. 8). In both structures the crystal lattice is further stabilized by weak C–H⋯O interactions.

From cou.: 36 Magnetic moments higher than the spin-only value of 1.73 are observed in copper(II) complexes (3d9), due to spin–orbit coupling. Monomeric copper(II) complexes generally show magnetic moments in the range 1.75 to 2.2 μB at room temperature. The EPR spectra of the powdered complexes with gx = 2.056, gy = 2.066 and gz = 2.258 parameters for 1 (Fig. 9a) and gx = 2.057, gy = 2.057 and gz = 2.262 for 2 (Fig. 9b) are typical for axial symmetry of Cu(II) coordination polyhedron (with a very weak rhombic distortion) for 1 and axial symmetry for 2. The g parameter values for 1 and 2 correspond to the dx2−y2 orbital of the unpaired electron ground state and are characteristic of the N2O2 donor set provided by the ligands in the xy Cu(II) plane. The low field “parallel” part of the spectrum for 2 exhibits signals due to hyperfine interaction between unpaired electrons and copper nucleus (nuclear spin I = 3/2) with A∥ = 169 × 10−4 cm−1 (Fig. 9b). It is a rare case when the hyperfine splitting is resolved in a powder EPR spectrum of a Cu(II) complex suggesting a greater isolation of Cu(II) centers than in 1 due to water molecules at axial positions which are involved in hydrogen bonds with carboxyl groups. The Cu–Cu distances are in fact greater in 2 than in 1 (Table 2).

From cou.: 73 Interestingly, the zero-field splitting tensor and the g tensor were found to be non-coaxial. Spectra at all frequencies (Fig. 12) were successfully simulated assuming that the zfs tensor is rotated versus the g tensor by 11 degrees about the X axis. At 200 K, the following parameters were found: gx = 2.060, gy = 2.060, gz = 2.303, D = −1.135 cm−1, E = −0.0430 cm−1. The parameters derived from the X-band spectra (Fig. 13) at 77 K are very similar: gx = 2.06, gy = 2.06, gz = 2.30, |D| = 1.125 cm−1, |E| = 0.040 cm−1, with signals due to the monomeric impurities present at 300 mT. The spin Hamiltonian parameters are temperature-dependent and at 10 K (Fig. 14) they are gx = 2.056, gy = 2.045, gz = 2.320, D = −1.042 cm−1, E = −0.0075 cm−1, with the same angle of rotation of the zfs and g tensors as found at 200 K (11 deg). The reason for the deviation between the axes of the g and zfs tensors observed in the EPR spectra is the misalignment between the equatorial ligand plane and the Cu–Cu direction.

From cou.: 75 In copper(II) dimers, there are two contributions to the zero-field splitting parameters D and E. One is the magnetic dipole–dipole interaction, while the other one is associated with the anisotropy of the exchange interactions. These contributions cannot be determined separately in an experiment. The dipolar part depends on the Cu–Cu separation. Its largest component is oriented along the Cu–Cu direction, while the largest component of the exchange-related zfs is expected to be parallel to the gz direction. The latter should be at least approximately perpendicular to the plane of the equatorial ligands. The angle between the Cu–Cu vector and the normal to the equatorial ligand plane is 86 deg. We assume for simplicity that this angle equals 90 deg and define a system of coordinates in which the axis X is along Cu–Cu, and the axis Z is perpendicular to Cu–Cu and is tilted 4 deg from the normal to the plane defined by the equatorial ligands. In these coordinates one can write formulae for the dipole–dipole related Ddip and Edip parameters using the point-dipole approximation:
From Soup: 75 Interestingly, the zero-field splitting tensor and the g tensor were found to be non-coaxial. Spectra at all frequencies ( Fig. 12 ) were successfully simulated assuming that the zfs tensor is rotated versus the g tensor by 11 degrees about the X axis. At 200 K, the following parameters were found: g x = 2.060, g y = 2.060, g z = 2.303, D = −1.135 cm −1 , E = −0.0430 cm −1 . The parameters derived from the X-band spectra ( Fig. 13 ) at 77 K are very similar: g x = 2.06, g y = 2.06, g z = 2.30, | D | = 1.125 cm −1 , | E | = 0.040 cm −1 , with signals due to the monomeric impurities present at 300 mT. The spin Hamiltonian parameters are temperature-dependent and at 10 K ( Fig. 14 ) they are g x = 2.056, g y = 2.045, g z = 2.320, D = −1.042 cm −1 , E = −0.0075 cm −1 , with the same angle of rotation of the zfs and g tensors as found at 200 K (11 deg). The reason for the deviation between the axes of the g and zfs tensors observed in the EPR spectra is the misalignment between the equatorial ligand plane and the Cu–Cu direction.

From cou.: 76 D
From Soup: 76 Since the complex is ferromagnetic, EPR spectra could be detected at very low temperatures allowing determination of the sign of D and E . 41 This is possible thanks to the Zeeman splitting being comparable to the thermal energy, kT ( Fig. 15 ).
 ###### 
From cou.: 77 E
From Soup: 77 In copper( II ) dimers, there are two contributions to the zero-field splitting parameters D and E . One is the magnetic dipole–dipole interaction, while the other one is associated with the anisotropy of the exchange interactions. These contributions cannot be determined separately in an experiment. The dipolar part depends on the Cu–Cu separation. Its largest component is oriented along the Cu–Cu direction, while the largest component of the exchange-related zfs is expected to be parallel to the g z direction. The latter should be at least approximately perpendicular to the plane of the equatorial ligands. The angle between the Cu–Cu vector and the normal to the equatorial ligand plane is 86 deg. We assume for simplicity that this angle equals 90 deg and define a system of coordinates in which the axis X is along Cu–Cu, and the axis Z is perpendicular to Cu–Cu and is tilted 4 deg from the normal to the plane defined by the equatorial ligands. In these coordinates one can write formulae for the dipole–dipole related D dip and E dip parameters using the point-dipole approximation:

From Soup: 135 Three novel complexes were isolated by addition of γ-picoline, β-picoline and triethanolamine to the hydrated copper( II ) 2-nitrobenzoate, [Cu 2 (2-nitrobenzoate) 4 (H 2 O) 2 ]·2H 2 O suspended in a 4 : 1 methanol–water mixture. It has been found that the addition of different types of N-donor ligands (rigid and flexible) has a profound influence on the orientation of –NO 2 and –COO − moieties in these complexes and, above all, on the coordination geometry around the Cu atom. Detailed structural analysis of 1 , 2 and 3 confirms that the addition of different N-donor ligands to copper( II ) carboxylates may affect their physico-chemical behaviour such as magnetism. The dimeric complex 3 exhibits relatively strong ferromagnetic exchange with J = −100 cm −1 (corresponding to H = JS 1 S 2 ). The zero-field splitting parameters (zfs) of the dimer triplet state D = −1.135 cm −1 , E = −0.043 cm −1 were derived from the HF EPR spectrum recorded at moderately low temperatures. The sign of D was determined from low-temperature HF EPR spectra.
