From cou.: 2 Coordination polymers (CPs), which are organometallic polymer structures containing metal cation centers linked by organic ligands, have now occupied an important position in the porous-materials area owing to their particular intriguing architectures and potential applications in gas storage,1 chemical separation,2 heterogeneous catalysis,3 drug delivery,4 and sensing.5 Among the diverse CPs, the lanthanide coordination polymers (Ln-CPs) display outstanding optical properties such as relatively long luminescence lifetime, high color purity, and sharp line emission originating from characteristic 4f electron transitions, which allow them to have potential application in light-emitting devices, electro-optic devices, and fluorescent probes.5a,6 Up to now, most of the luminescent Ln-CPs have been developed as fluorescent probes for sensing of organic small molecules, metal cations, anions, explosives and vapors,5a,b however, luminescent Ln-CPs used for recognition and probing for temperature have seldom been reported.7

From cou.: 3 Temperature is a fundamental thermodynamic variable, which is the most frequently measured physical parameter in numerous fields. Compared with the traditional methods (thermocouples, thermistors, liquid-filled and bimetallic thermometers) for temperature measurements, luminescence-based measurements have unique advantages, such as, fast response, noninvasive, non-contact accurate, and nanometric precision and are able to work even in strong electric or magnetic fields.8 However, most luminescence methods for measuring temperature explored until now are mainly based on the temperature-dependent luminescence intensity of one transition. Their accuracy can be influenced by excitation power, the concentration of the sensor, and the drifts of the optoelectronic systems such as lamps and detectors.9 The mixed-lanthanide coordination polymers (M′Ln-CPs), utilizing self-referenced signals, can circumvent many of these drawbacks, and are expected to be more accurate luminescent thermometers.10 Herein, to dope Eu3+ into an isostructural Tb3+-CP, we obtained a mixed-lanthanide coordination polymer [(Eu0.0616Tb0.9382)(L)2(NO3)2]·Cl·2H2O (Eu0.0618Tb0.9382L; L = 1,4-bis(pyridinil-4-carboxylato)-1,4-dimethylbenzene). It displays two main narrow emission bands (Tb3+ at 544 nm and Eu3+ at 613 nm), each of which has its own temperature dependence. The luminescence intensity ratio of the two emission bands ITb/IEu affords a self-referenced signal used for more accurate probing for temperature.

From cou.: 4 Solvothermal reaction of Ln(NO3)3·6H2O with [H2L]Cl2 in DMF solvent at 85 °C for 72 h afforded colorless tetragonal-shaped crystals of Ln-CPs, which were formulated as [Ln(L)2(NO3)2]·Cl·2H2O (Ln = Eu, Tb, and Gd; L = 1,4-bis(pyridinil-4-carboxylato)-1,4-dimethylbenzene). The three lanthanide compounds are isostructural and crystallize in the tetragonal space group I4/m. Herein the EuL compound is a representative for structural description. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the compound contains a europium ion, two L ligands, two coordinated nitrate ions, one free chloride ion, and two free water molecules. The central europium ion adopts distorted dodecahedron geometry and is coordinated by eight oxygen atoms from four L ligands and two nitrate ions (Fig. S1†). The average Eu–O distance is 2.367 Å, which is within the expected range (2.353–2.717 Å).

From cou.: 5 It is noteworthy that the ligand coordinates to two europium ions with the monodentate coordination mode, and two europium ions together with two ligands generate a 38-atom ring-like structure (Fig. 1a). As shown in Fig. 1b, the adjacent rings form a one dimensional chain by sharing the europium ion. By means of the hydrogen bonds (C(10)–H(10)⋯O(4) distance of ca. 3.30(2) Å; C(7)–(H7)⋯O(3) distance of ca. 3.38(2) Å), a two dimensional supramolecular layer forms (Fig. 1c). With the aid of hydrogen bonds (C(10)–H(10)⋯O(4); C(7)–(H7)⋯O(3)) and π–π stacking interactions between aromatic rings (face-to-face distance of ca. 3.49 Å), the layers stack in parallel along the b-axis, and lead to the generation of a three dimensional supramolecular architecture (Fig. S2†). Fig. S3† shows the three dimensional supramolecular structure viewing in the c direction, with the free water molecules and the free chloride ions filling in the interspace. All LnL CPs were isostructural, which was further certified by powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. S4†).

From cou.: 6 The solid-state photoluminescence (PL) properties of [H2L]Cl2 and LnL have been investigated at room temperature and given in Fig. S6–S10.† As shown in Fig. S6,† the free ligand [H2L]Cl2 shows a broad band with a maximum at 397 nm under excitation at 203 nm, which could be ascribed to π→π* electron transitions. Upon excitation at 352 and 357 nm, the EuL and TbL reveal the typical Eu3+ and Tb3+ characteristic emission peaks, respectively. EuL displays the emission peaks at 595, 617, 651, and 697 nm, which are assigned to 5D0→7F1–4 (Eu3+) transitions (Fig. S7†); while TbL exhibits very strong emission peaks at 488, 544, 590, and 621 nm, corresponding to the 5D4→7F6–2 (Tb3+) transitions (Fig. S8†). As expected, the M′Ln-CPs, Eu0.0311Tb0.9689L and Eu0.0618Tb0.9382L simultaneously display both 5D0→7F1–4 (Eu3+) and 5D4→7F6–2 (Tb3+) characteristic transitions (Fig. S9 and S10†). The blue light emission for the free ligand completely disappears in these Ln-CPs, suggesting that the [H2L]Cl2 ligand is an excellent antenna chromophore for sensitization of both Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions. It is worth mentioning that the emission of the Eu3+ ions in M′Ln-CPs is further sensitized by the Tb3+ ions within the same frameworks. As seen in Fig. S11 and S12,† the room temperature emission spectra of Eu0.0311Tb0.9689L and Eu0.0618Tb0.9382L excited at 488 nm, which exclusively corresponds to the 7F6→5D4 transition of the Tb3+ ions, provides the evidence for energy transfer from Tb3+ to Eu3+ ions.

From cou.: 7 To investigate their potential as luminescent thermometers, the temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) properties of these LnL and M′LnLs were also studied. The emission spectra of EuL and TbL from 25 K to 300 K has been given in Fig. 2a and b, and the intensities of the 5D0→7F2 (Eu3+, 617 nm) and 5D4→7F5 (Tb3+, 544 nm) transitions have been shown in Fig. 2d (inset). The emission intensity of both Eu3+ in EuL and Tb3+ in TbL decreases gradually with the temperature increasing, which is expected to be due to the thermal activation of nonradiative-decay processes. As expected, the M′Ln-CP, Eu0.0618Tb0.9382L, displays a different temperature-dependent luminescence behavior from those of EuL and TbL (Fig. 2c). The emission intensity of the Tb3+ ions in Eu0.0618Tb0.9382L decreases with the temperature increasing, while the emission intensity of Eu3+ ions increases slowly from 25 K to 150 K and then decreases in the 150–300 K temperature range (Fig. 2d). The emission intensity ratio ITb/IEu (5D4→7F5 (Tb3+, 544 nm) to 5D0→7F2 (Eu3+, 613 nm) transition), is commonly used as a self-referenced signal probe for temperature, which can overcome many of the drawbacks.

From cou.: 9 In order to better clarify the mechanism of energy transfer, the temperature dependence lifetimes of the excited states 5D0 (Eu3+, 544 nm) and 5D4 (Tb3+, 613 nm) were investigated (Fig. S15–S17†). The phenomenon that Eu0.0618Tb0.9382L shows shorter 5D4 (Tb3+) lifetime than TbL but longer 5D0 (Eu3+) lifetime than EuL at the same temperature, suggests the energy transfer from the Tb3+ to Eu3+ occurs. The energy transfer efficiency can be calculated as follows:
