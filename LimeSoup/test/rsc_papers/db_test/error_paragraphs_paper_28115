From cou.: 1 The identification of improved carbon dioxide (CO2) capture solvents remains a challenge due to the vast number of potentially-suitable molecules. We propose an optimization-based computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) method to identify and select, from hundreds of thousands of possibilities, a few solvents of optimum performance for CO2 chemisorption processes, as measured by a comprehensive set of criteria. The first stage of the approach involves a fast screening stage where solvent structures are evaluated based on the simultaneous consideration of important pure component properties reflecting thermodynamic, kinetic, and sustainability behaviour. The impact of model uncertainty is considered through a systematic method that employs multiple models for the prediction of performance indices. In the second stage, high-performance solvents are further selected and evaluated using a more detailed thermodynamic model, i.e. the group-contribution statistical associating fluid theory for square well potentials (SAFT-γ SW), to predict accurately the highly non-ideal chemical and phase equilibrium of the solvent–water–CO2 mixtures. The proposed CAMD method is applied to the design of novel molecular structures and to the screening of a data set of commercially available amines. New molecular structures and commercially-available compounds that have received little attention as CO2 capture solvents are successfully identified and assessed using the proposed approach. We recommend that these solvents should be given priority in experimental studies to identify new compounds.

From cou.: 2 In view of the pressing need to curtail carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere in a world that remains highly dependent on carbon-based fuels for its energy provision, a large number of technological solutions for CO2 capture are currently being investigated.1 Chemical absorption processes2,3 represent a well-established industrial technology for CO2 capture compared to many of the alternatives that are being developed: it can be retrofitted onto existing plants and the conditions for both absorption and solvent regeneration (desorption) are relatively easy to meet. However, some major downsides must be overcome to enable the widespread adoption of this technology. These include the high energy input required for solvent regeneration and negative environmental impacts associated with the solvents, to name but a few.4

From cou.: 3 Many of these issues can be linked to the solvents most commonly used in such processes, namely, amine-based organic compounds. In view of the shortcomings of these solvents, significant efforts are being devoted to identify solvents that can significantly improve the economic and sustainability performance of chemisorption processes, compared to existing options. The identification of improved solvents, however, is very challenging due to a) the highly non-ideal solvent–CO2–water chemical interactions, b) the countless combinations of potential capture solvents and blend candidates and c) the complex interactions between the solvent and the process that require the simultaneous consideration of multiple criteria5 in the selection of solvents with optimum capture features. To address this last aspect, one must avoid focusing on a narrow property target (e.g. Oexmann and Kather6 argue convincingly against searching for low heat of absorption solvents) and instead consider a comprehensive set of properties related to thermodynamics, kinetics and sustainability.

From cou.: 4 A large number of experimental studies have been undertaken to identify solvents and solvent blends that perform better than the current benchmark solvent, aqueous solutions of monoethanolamine (MEA). Based on the collective experience of a large community of researchers, several rules of thumb have been formulated to help generate molecular structures that are likely to perform well as CO2 chemisorption solvents. For example, Singh et al.7–9 and Singh and Versteeg10 performed a large set of experiments to derive useful insights into the effects of amine structure on important parameters such as absorption rate and solvent capacity. Other researchers have developed qualitative design rules which can be used for the heuristic screening of solvents, and a selection of these heuristics is listed in Table 1, with more details provided in section A in the ESI.† While qualitative relationships that link structure and properties offer a very useful guide to search the vast space of possibilities, they also reduce the diversity of the options considered, thereby decreasing the potential for novel designs. Additionally, they do not reduce the significant cost of obtaining a measure of the performance of the postulated solvents, which requires the synthesis and characterization of each new solvent. For instance, the laboratory-based investigation of DEAB has required extensive effort as reflected in publications related to compound identification11,12 and investigation.13–16 Thus, in addition to acquiring high-quality data for different solvents, there is a need to accelerate the search using computational methods.17

From cou.: 7 While research on CAMD methods has led to the development of many sophisticated and successful CAMD techniques, the deployment of a systematic approach in the context of chemisorption is not without difficulty. The models typically used in chemisorption process design, while of high accuracy, are specific to a given solvent and require extensive experimental data on each solvent to be studied; this is the case of models of the thermodynamics and kinetics of aqueous alkanolamine and CO2 mixtures (e.g. eNRTL models36–38) and of the kinetics of degradation reactions.39–41 A few predictive models that relate solvent molecular structure or solvent blend composition to properties, and hence performance, are available to support CAMD activities. As a result, recent research efforts to screen CO2 capture solvents quantitatively have mostly been based on the use of simple approximation models or statistical correlations.42,43 While such approaches led to some promising results, the narrow range of performance criteria considered and the relatively low accuracy of the predictive models have not allowed the full benefits of in silico solvent design to be realized.

From cou.: 8 Encouragingly, three CAMD-based approaches have been reported for the design of CO2 capture solvents for chemisorption processes. Eden and co-workers44,45 have proposed solvents to replace MDEA in an absorption/desorption process, using a range of physical properties to define the optimum molecular design space44 and developing a new CAMD algorithm.45 Salazar et al.46 used different physical properties as performance criteria to identify a few promising solvents. These solvents were then evaluated based on their stripping energy requirement, calculated using ASPEN Plus®47 process models and with the reaction and thermodynamic models derived in part from similarity with MEA and DEA (diethanolamine) and in part by using undisclosed NRTL48 parameters derived based on UNIFAC49 groups to model the liquid phase non-ideality.

From cou.: 9 Among these CAMD-based works, only Salazar et al.46 considered the multicomponent chemical and phase equilibria that are central to solvent performance as an explicit part of the design. However, to the best of our knowledge, the physical model used has not been validated against experimental data and its predictive capabilities are unknown. In this context, the increasing availability of reliable predictive models of relevance to chemisorption provides opportunities to enhance CAMD approaches to CO2 capture solvent design by broadening the range of performance metrics and increasing their reliability. Chemical reactivity, for instance, has been predicted using continuum solvation models, among other computational chemistry methods, for the calculation of the amine base strength as a measure of molecular reactivity.50,51 Although such models are computationally expensive, they could, in the future, be included in CAMD approaches that embed quantum mechanical models.52,53

From cou.: 10 Another interesting route is the use of a predictive equation of state, such as the statistical associating fluid theory equation for potentials of variable range, SAFT-VR,54,55 which has been applied within a CAMD methodology to the design of solvents for the separation of CO2 from a natural gas stream through physical absorption using a single family of compounds56 or within a group contribution version57 for a broader range of compounds.58 The use of the SAFT platform to design CO2 capture solvents for physical absorption was also proposed by Bardow et al.,59 Oyarzún et al.,60 Stavrou et al.61 and Lampe et al.62 using the PC-SAFT EoS, the perturbed-chain version of SAFT63 and the PCP-SAFT EoS, its extension to polar fluids.64–66 In the context of chemisorption, the SAFT thermodynamic platform has been used to predict the phase and chemical equilibria of CO2 capture fluids through a parameterization of a group contribution version of the statistical associating fluid theory for potentials of variable range equation of state, SAFT-γ SW.67,68 This approach has been applied successfully to model primary alkanolamines and their mixtures with water and CO2.69–71 With such a model, it becomes possible to treat aqueous solutions of CO2 and amines for which no data are available and to investigate the effect of decision variables such as composition and temperature, as well as the performance of mixtures containing several amine components.

From cou.: 11 Drawing on these advances, we aim in our work to identify a set of promising solvents that offer a simultaneously high performance in many criteria associated with effective chemical absorption of CO2 and solvent regeneration. For the first time in CO2 capture research, we take an approach that combines thermodynamic behaviour, reactivity and sustainability as performance criteria in solvent design or selection and that includes predictive models of the phase and chemical equilibria of the solvents identified. Furthermore, we recognise the inherent uncertainty in many of the methods we use and propose a strategy to address this issue and reduce the risk of premature elimination of solvent candidates. The proposed approach can easily be extended to include other aspects not considered here provided that appropriate structure–property models are available (e.g. the selectivity of the solvent towards CO2 can be predicted using thermodynamic models similar to those used to predict CO2 loading). Other considerations not accounted for here, such as propensity to oxidative degradation, can be investigated for the solvents in the final set obtained. The proposed computer-based solvent design framework is applied in two ways: (i) a database of commercially available molecules is screened systematically for high-performance capture options (solvent selection) and (ii) novel molecules that are found to be optimum capture solvents are identified (solvent design).

From cou.: 16 Both cases are addressed within a single framework whose major characteristics include the use of a wide range of properties as criteria for solvent selection and design, the use of simple models to develop an initial list of candidate solvents, the explicit consideration of uncertainty in decision-making and the pruning of the list of candidate solvents using a more advanced predictive model (here, we use the SAFT-γ SW EoS). Uncertainty is accounted for by generating a distribution of solvent ranks that results from the use of different prediction models for the same properties. The distribution of ranks is widely used in non-parametric statistics72 to detect patterns in data without requiring information on error distributions or other assumptions on the data under consideration. These ideas are implemented within a systematic, two-stage approach, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Each step is introduced in the remainder of this section.

From cou.: 17 The aim of stage 1 is to quickly identify and eliminate solvents of inferior performance, producing a “long list” of candidates. In the design problem, the algorithm used73 can rapidly evaluate around 200000 molecular structures to generate a few tens of solvents comprising the “long list”. Solvents are designed and/or evaluated using GC and non-GC-based models for the prediction of properties that are specifically selected to reflect the major driving forces for CO2 capture. The selected properties provide a set of solvent performance measures that link the chemical structure of the solvent to thermodynamic, reactivity and sustainability characteristics of importance in the capture/regeneration process (see section 3 for details).

 ###### 
From cou.: 19 Step 1.1 applies to the design problem, but not to the selection problem, in which the database constitutes the initial solvent list. In this step, candidate solvents are generated from the design space defined by the set of functional groups and the design rules that determine which molecules should be considered. The long list is generated by using a CAMD approach based on multiple property criteria to identify a set of high performance options.73 It combines GC models with a multi-objective optimization approach to synthesize optimum novel or existing solvents. This approach enables the simultaneous evaluation of several properties as performance criteria, and hence, it is particularly suitable for the generation of a rich pool of optimum solvent candidates reflecting important property trade-offs. In optimization terms, this pool represents the non-dominated (Pareto) front of optimum solutions.73 Every solvent in this front is such that it is not possible to improve the value of one of its properties without deterioration in at least one of its other properties. Additional details regarding the method may be found in Papadopoulos and Linke73 and Papadopoulos et al.33 The resulting non-dominated list of solvents includes high performance candidates but is sufficiently small so that every solvent can be further evaluated in subsequent steps.

When several models are used for one property, the differences between the multiple columns in J provide a measure of the underlying model uncertainty and make it possible to identify solvents with potentially high performance in spite of model uncertainty.

From Soup: 38 To this end, the elements in each column of J are sorted in ascending order independently for every column (model combination) k , yielding a matrix J′ of independently rank-ordered columns. The transformations needed to go from J to J′ can be used to construct a matrix of ranked lists, L , in which an entry L r , k is an integer that denotes the identity of the r th ranked solvent according to model combination k . Consider an example with the same dimensionality as that in Table 2 : the elements of matrix L will be of the form presented in Fig. 2a . The solvents may follow a different order for different k values ( i.e. different combinations of models). For example, solvent 3 ranks first for k = 2, second for k = 1, 3, 5, 6, and third for k = 4. In addition, notice that all four solvents appear in the top 2 positions (ranks 1 and 2). For this small solvent set, the number of appearances of each solvent in the top 2 positions can be used to select solvents to be taken forward for further analysis, as shown in Fig. 2b : solvents 1 and 3 show the strongest predicted performance, closely followed by solvent 2, while solvent 4 appears to be an under-performer.

From Soup: 39 The frequent appearance of specific solvents at the top implies an agreement in the predictions made by multiple different models. On the other hand, even solvents that appear with lower frequency at the top are also considered due to the use of the distribution of ranks to select candidate molecules. This allows a reduction of the original solvent list without bias due to uncertainty in the predictions. This is important because there is often little or no prior knowledge on the predictive accuracy of the models employed. As a result, agreement in the predictions obtained from different models does not necessarily imply a higher accuracy than in the case where fewer models result in similar or different predictions. With the proposed approach, assumptions related to accuracy are avoided. Further details are provided in section B.2 in the ESI. †

From Soup: 51 The liquid heat capacity ( C p ) plays an important role in determining the heat required to regenerate the amine-based solution during desorption. This heat can be divided into three components: 79 the sensible heat, the heat of vaporization (mostly that of water, which is the main component evaporated in the reboiler), and the heat of absorption necessary to desorb one mole of CO 2 . The sensible heat represents the heat required to raise the temperature of the solution from the absorption to the desorption temperature. This is directly proportional to the heat capacity, C p , of this solution. Hence, a solution containing an amine with a low C p may be assumed to contribute towards reducing the sensible heat requirements. C p is predicted via a GC method 80 developed specifically for amine-based solvents used in CO 2 capture.

Quantum chemistry continuum-solvation models 50,51 provide a robust prediction of p K a , but the screening of large solvent sets requires less computationally-demanding approaches.

PDS has been shown to result in p K a values for several amine solvents which are as accurate as predictions using quantum chemistry calculations. 50 The Taft method also provides sufficiently accurate predictions for many well-known amine solvents. Both methods are based on an analysis of the effects of substituents in molecules and employ rules for determining the p K a when a particular substituent is attached to a given position within a molecular structure.

The solvent performance criteria used during this CAMD step are calculated exclusively from GC models; hence, this step accounts only for properties which may be calculated using such models.

Given the property models chosen for stage 1, the multi-objective optimization problem is thus reduced to:Note that RED is used as a constraint during CAMD, with REDup being an upper limit which may be set to 1 as noted previously or to a higher value, for example using MEA as a reference point. The RED of MEA is 3.94 using model 1.2 of Table B1 in the ESI.† The multi-objective formulation in problem (5) is solved to identify the set of non-dominated optimum solvents using the approach of Papadopoulos and Linke.73
From Soup: 71 At stage 2 (step 2.2), more detailed models are required to estimate mixture behaviour and, in particular, the absorption capacity of the candidate solvents. Most models of the thermodynamic behaviour of reactive mixtures of aqueous solvents and CO 2 require extensive experimental data on the specific solvent of interest. However, more predictive models have recently been derived from the SAFT 95,96 equation of state. A systematic approach to the modelling of the thermodynamics of CO 2 chemisorption solvents based on limited data has been developed for monoethanolamine (MEA) 97 and n -alkylamines 98 and further extended by Rodriguez et al. 99 using the SAFT-VR EoS applied to various aqueous mixtures of alkanolamines and carbon dioxide. To enhance the predictive capabilities of this approach, models to predict the phase behaviour and thermophysical properties of aqueous alkanolamine mixtures with CO 2 using the GC formalism embedded within the SAFT-γ SW framework 67,68 have been proposed. 69–71 This provides a much firmer basis for the design of novel solvents, enabling the design of molecular structure and mixture composition to be varied. Thus, in step 2.1, the fluid-phase behaviour of mixtures of the candidate solvents with carbon dioxide and water is evaluated using the SAFT-γ SW EoS, provided that the relevant building blocks are available in the corresponding group contribution table ( cf. section D in the ESI † ). Both phase and chemical equilibria are taken into account simultaneously via this model, enabling a more detailed assessment of the selected solvents. Partial pressure profiles are used to assess the relative performance of the solvents in terms of absorption potential. Saturated vapour pressures and densities can also be evaluated with the approach.

From Soup: 72 The final specification required to enable the application of our approach to CO 2 capture solvents is the definition of the search space. The search space for solvent design is defined by a set of 13 functional groups, namely, CH 3 –, –CH 2 –, >CH–, >C<, –OH, –CH 2 –NH 2 , –CH 2 –NH–, –CH 2 –N<, >CH–NH 2 , >CH–NH–, CH 3 –NH–, CH 3 –N<, and ≥C–NH 2 . These groups are chosen due to the availability of the input data required for the calculation of pure-component molecular properties through GC methods and their frequent occurrence in existing CO 2 capture solvents.

This indicator, however, is not available for the rest of the molecules in the data set.

From Soup: 102 The performance of structures D1–D10 relative to MEA is presented in Fig. 5 . Except for EHS, all the sustainability indices point to lower performance than MEA. This is a reasonable outcome because the sustainability indices were not considered during CAMD in step 1.1 but as a subsequent measure to identify the solvents with lower impacts among those obtained from CAMD. In this case ( Fig. 5b ), EHS and EI-99 improved, but CED and GWP slightly deteriorated, possibly due to the effect of the remaining property indices.

From Soup: 103 Furthermore, the apparent trade-off between the EHS and LCA indices could be attributed to the fact that molecules which are structurally larger and more complex than MEA would have longer production chains with higher environmental impacts, while they could be more stable with higher boiling points and thus lower mobility index values. The mobility index is also used as a correction factor for the toxicity and flammability indices to account for the relative ease of vapour formation promoting the risk of inhalation or catching fire. All the molecules in Table 9 show improved toxicity indices and slightly better flammability indices due to the improved mobility indices. However, they suffer from worse environmental indices such as aquatic toxicity and persistency in the environment. This could be a result of the more complex structure that is less naturally occurring and thus less prone to degradation in the environment. Tables C3a and C3b in the ESI † present, respectively, the LCA metrics and the various hazard indices and the parameters used to calculate them for the molecular structures listed in Table 9 .

To this end, we exploit the qualitative structure–property relationships (1) and (2) reported in Table 1 to identify isomers that are likely to exhibit favourable CO 2 capture performance. The structures are transformed into the generic, hydrogen free representations of [OCCN], [OCCCN] (structure–property relationship (1)) and [NC⋯CN] with up to 6 carbon atoms (structure–property relationship (2)) which can then be processed computationally. The proposed motifs are sought systematically in the structures of the isomers using the publically available Small Molecules Subgraph Detector software 124 which employs a maximum common subgraph method 125 to identify similarities between molecular structures. Note that structure–property relationship (2) was considered by Aronu et al. 20 who started from a structure similar to TMEDA (C15) and heuristically identified TMBPA (E7) for further testing as a CO 2 capture solvent. We adopt a similar rational approach for the selection of isomer candidates, but we combine two structure–property relationships in our search. The results are shown in Table 10 .

From Soup: 107 Among the solvents in Table 10 , isomer D6 is clearly very similar to TMBPA, indicating that the CAMD method has delivered a potentially highly performing molecule despite its complex structure. Isomers D1, D3, D4 and D5 present a side chain with a longer carbon backbone. Structure–property relationship (2) has been applied in the form of [NCCCN] for at least one pair of nitrogen atoms in each molecule. These molecules also contain a quaternary carbon atom bonded to a primary amine group, which introduces moderate steric hindrance to the molecule and resembles the structure of AMP. The existence of 3 amine groups with moderate steric hindrance is expected to increase the absorption capacity, while the appearance of at least one primary group and one secondary group is expected to ensure reasonable kinetic performance, assuming that a carbamate will always be formed.

From Soup: 108 Isomers D2, D7, D8, D9 and D10 all contain a hydroxyl. D2 is a commercially available structure with a CAS registry number of 91875-44-4 and is the solvent shared between the two cases investigated in Fig. 5 . It can be said to exhibit steric hindrance based on structure–property relationship (6) in Table 1 . These molecules all contain one or two primary or secondary amine groups. They are combined with a quaternary carbon atom; hence, they also resemble AMP, except for D9 which is a simpler hydroxyl-diamine. In isomers D2, D7, D8 and D10, structure–property relationship (1) appears as [NCCO] or [NCCCO], while structure–property relationship (2) also appears in D10. D9 is a commercially available amine with a CAS number of 85771-07-9. The structure is very similar to AEEA (shown next to D9 in Table 10 ) which exhibits absorption capacity, CO 2 reactivity, and energy efficiency higher than those of MEA, while it has also low vapour pressure. 126

From Soup: 109 The sets of selected and designed solvents are now considered jointly for further analysis. The SAFT-γ SW EoS is used to predict the phase behaviour of all solvents in these sets, which can be modelled with the approach using the current set of group interactions available (section D in the ESI † ). These are MMEA, EMEA, MPA, 1M2P, DBA and D9. Comparisons with experimental data, where available, and with the performance of MEA are provided.

From Soup: 110 Several authors have measured the solubility of CO 2 in aqueous mixtures of MMEA 127–129 and EMEA 110 under conditions of chemical and vapour–liquid equilibria. In Fig. 6a and b , we compare SAFT-γ SW predictions for MMEA mixtures and EMEA mixtures, respectively, with experimental data. The agreement with experiments is good considering these calculations are purely predictive and that the group parameters have been characterised based on data for other alkanolamines at lower loadings. 71 In particular, the relative solubility of CO 2 in the different solvents is found to be reliable. Furthermore, both models and experiments indicate that CO 2 loading ( cf. Figure D1 in the ESI † ) decreases with solvent concentration at moderate to high pressures but increases with solvent concentration at low pressures. The qualitative agreement achieved provides a useful basis for solvent selection. We note that the accuracy of the model could be improved by developing group interaction parameters that account for the proximity effects between the groups of relevance to MMEA and EMEA, as has been done successfully for other groups. 70,71

From Soup: 111 A further comparison with experimental data can be seen in Fig. 7 for the solubility of CO 2 in aqueous solutions of MPA. The data for this mixture at two temperatures ( T = 313.15 K and 393.15 K) were used in the estimation of a number of group parameters; 70 and therefore, only the calculations at 343.15 K and 373.15 K can be seen as predictions. SAFT-γ is found to provide a very good description of the effect of temperature on the solubility of CO 2 in this case.

From Soup: 112 A comparison of the predicted performance of SAFT-γ for a number of high-performing solvents is presented in Fig. 8 . These solvents are compared here based on the solubility of CO 2 in aqueous solutions of a given mass percentage. At a low temperature ( T = 313.15 K) typical of an absorption process, there is a range of pressures at which all solvents are predicted to reach higher solubility loadings than MEA for a given partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The range of pressures at which this occurs is wider for DBA and D9. Solvents such as MMEA, EMEA and 1M2P present very similar solubility curves; this can be attributed to the similarities in their molecular structures (see Table 4 ). At a high temperature ( T = 393.15 K) typical of a desorption process, and at solubility loadings lower than 0.5, most of the solvents appear to outperform the regeneration capacity of MEA, as they lead to partial pressures of CO 2 higher than those obtained with MEA. At high loadings, MEA leads to only slightly higher partial pressures than MMEA, EMEA, 1M2P and MPA.

From Soup: 114 A systematic two-stage approach to molecular design has been proposed and applied to the discovery of CO 2 capture solvents. The approach is based on multiple criteria, is applicable to the identification of molecules from databases or functional groups, combines simple group contribution models with the molecular-based SAFT framework, and takes model uncertainty into account. It has been used to generate a prioritised list of candidate molecules from hundreds of thousands of possible compounds.

It has been used to generate a prioritised list of candidate molecules from hundreds of thousands of possible compounds.
From Soup: 115 The proposed methodology has clearly led to the identification of important candidate solvents for CO 2 capture, including novel compounds. Several of these have been tested experimentally in the published literature and recommended as highly performing alternatives to MEA, indicating that the proposed approach leads to the rapid identification of useful compounds. Others have received little attention or have yet to be considered as alternatives for CO 2 capture despite their commercial availability indicated by their CAS registry number, demonstrating that the proposed approach can help generate novel leads. For example in the cases of 2A1B, 2A1PN and 2A1H only a patent that mentions very good stability and reduced corrosiveness compared to MEA when they are used in mixtures with MDEA exists; however, no equilibrium or reaction kinetic data are reported. In several cases, the structural and property resemblance of these candidates with state-of-the-art solvents recently considered as CO 2 capture options provides significant motivation to undertake further experimental testing. Without prior intention or use of any specific constraints, the selection procedure also resulted in the identification of several thermomorphic biphasic solvents. Such solvents enable desorption at temperatures much lower than the 120 °C employed in the MEA case, hence requiring a significantly lower regeneration load.

From Soup: 116 The novel solvents designed using the proposed CAMD approach combine structural characteristics that are known empirically to promote both high CO 2 absorption capacity and increased reaction rates. D6 is a novel structure proposed by CAMD which is very similar to TMBPA, a multi-functional amine identified in the published literature as a solvent of high CO 2 absorption capacity and reaction rate in mixtures with piperazine. The isomers corresponding to D2 and D9 are commercially available solvents. This is clear evidence that the systematic CAMD approach employed in this work points towards promising CO 2 capture options, despite the initial use of simple property prediction models. This is further confirmed by the phase and chemical equilibrium predictions obtained with the SAFT-γ SW equation of state. For example, D9 exhibits very high performance as it actually outperforms all the other amines in the commercial set for a wide range of pressures. The fact that such an assessment of absorption and desorption potential can be made without recourse to any experimental data on the candidate solvents, and indeed without ever synthesizing the proposed molecules, is a significant benefit of the use of a predictive model such as SAFT-γ SW, relative to approaches based on more qualitative rules for solvent selection.

From Soup: 117 Due to the use of sustainability metrics in different stages of the methodology, a clear opportunity has been identified to develop less hazardous solvents than MEA. However, the LCA metrics do not always point in the same direction as safety metrics, and the improvement potential with respect to MEA is limited to specific solvents and metrics. Of course, it has to be noted that these LCA metrics refer only to the life cycle impact of solvent production, and therefore, the extent of solvent fugitive losses and degradation has been neglected in this analysis, despite its known importance in the case of MEA. Additionally, other more significant life cycle impacts ( e.g. the solvent regeneration life cycle impact) are indirectly covered by the thermodynamic properties considered in CAMD.

From Soup: 118 In our current work, we have shown that considering multiple and diverse criteria in the design of solvents using a CAMD method can lead to novel molecules. Building on this approach, the space of molecules to be explored and the range of criteria for the in silico assessment of candidate compounds could both be extended. For instance, the consideration of higher order groups in the group contribution models employed could increase the accuracy of the property predictions and allow the more reliable identification of the most suitable isomers as CO 2 capture options. Predictive group contribution property models that provide accurate caloric information 56 could also be used to achieve a more direct assessment of energy consumption and operating cost. Furthermore, the proposed uncertainty quantification method could be expanded to account for additional properties, especially those associated with sustainability. Sustainability metrics in the form of group contribution models combined with uncertainty quantification could also be considered during CAMD to enable a more focused search as well as to increase the robustness of the obtained results. Since the results obtained from CAMD also provide insights into the structural combinations that favour CO 2 capture, this could be used to prioritize the efforts to develop new group contribution parameters for the SAFT-γ SW equation, in the form of new functional groups, or of combinations of existing groups to form second-order groups and increase prediction accuracy. Such developments can provide further guidance for experimental studies and help to accelerate the search for better solvents.
