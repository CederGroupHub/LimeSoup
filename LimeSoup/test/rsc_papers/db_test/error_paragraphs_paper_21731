From cou.: 1 Using the self-consistent field (SCF) theory for inhomogeneous polymer systems, we elaborate a molecular model on a united atom level and discuss the possibility of coexistence of spherical micelles and small unilamellar vesicles in binary copolymer mixtures in a selective solvent. Our analysis is in line with recent neutron scattering and cryo-TEM results for the mixture of two members of the poly(butylene oxide)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (referred to as PBnPEm) family, namely the (n, m) = (10, 10) and (10, 18) species in water that clearly pointed towards such coexistence. The -PE18 is a micelle forming and the -PE10 a lamellae forming copolymer. Upon increasing concentration of -PE18 the micelle concentration that coexists with the vesicles increases dramatically. In this situation the micelles determine the chemical potentials of the copolymers and with increasing fraction PE18/PE10 the vesicle size becomes dramatically smaller. The selection of vesicle size indicates its thermodynamic stability. The strategy to arrive at thermodynamically stable vesicles with sizes much smaller than 100 nm is of interest for a wide range of applications.

From cou.: 2 Amphiphilic block copolymers in selective solvents are known to self-assemble into various association colloids ranging, e.g., from vesicles,1 rods,2 small disks,3 to micelles.4 Vesicles composed of block copolymers have been studied extensively, because of their stimuli responsiveness to physiochemical stimuli and their chemical diversity. Micelles have been studied for many years as well, for example to learn about their ability to solubilize hydrophobic molecules, and to take up active ingredients.5 Phase diagrams of amphiphilic molecules are fascinatingly complex, and this complexity even increases for mixed amphiphilic systems. This paper deals with a binary copolymer solution that spontaneously forms a mixture of vesicles and micelles.

From cou.: 3 There are various reports in the literature that point to the possibility of coexistence between different types of aggregates in one system, suggesting that phase transitions between different types of aggregates are possible. For example, early experimental observations of (cylindrical) micelle-vesicle coexistence in lipid-surfactant systems were published more than two decades ago.6,7 More recently, the coexistence of disklike micelles and vesicles received some attention.8 In a phenomenological model, Andelman and coworkers9 argued that in mixed dilute solutions a phase transition from cylindrical micelles to vesicles can occur when there is a large difference in preferred geometry of aggregation between the lipid and the surfactant. In their model these authors did not consider the size (nor size selection) of the vesicles and avoided all issues regarding the thermodynamic stability. Of a more recent date there are computer simulations10 that focus on the structural transition from micelles to vesicles and point to a possible coexistence of aggregates.

From cou.: 4 Experimentally, it is easiest to consider such structural transitions in binary amphiphilic mixtures. Most of these studies therefore have focused on mixtures of a pair of amphiphiles that differ dramatically in chemical structure, i.e. mixtures of short, relatively polar micelle-forming surfactants with very apolar lipid species that prefer vesicles.11 No systematic experimental nor theoretical studies are known that focus on the vesicle-to-micelle transition in a binary mixture with relatively little difference in molecular architecture between the constituent amphiphiles. In polymeric surfactants, however, there exist interesting possibilities to implement such an investigation.

From cou.: 5 In an accompanying paper, we report on our recent small angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements which indicate that in mixtures of two block copolymers that are chemically and compositionally similar to each other, vesicles and micelles can coexist. More specifically, we focused on two members of the poly(butylene oxide)-b-poly(ethylene oxide), PBnPEm, copolymer family in aqueous solutions, namely (n, m) = (10, 10) which is a lamellae forming copolymer, and (10, 18), which forms spherical micelles. We found that for a certain mixing ratio, small unilamellar mixed vesicles with an average radius of 30 nm and narrow polydispersity index 0.15 coexist with a relatively concentrated solution of spherical micelles with a radius of approximately 5 nm.12 These results were confirmed by cryo-TEM images on the same samples.

From cou.: 6 We have evidence that these systems represent true thermodynamic equilibrium. For example, we find that the structural features did not change for long storing times, that both the vesicles as well as the micelles have a narrow size distribution, and that the size as well as the polydispersity is a function of the polymer composition and the concentration. We used a freeze–thaw method to accelerate the equilibration, but the results were not sensitive to the details of the preparation procedure.

From cou.: 7 Hence, the question should be considered why such small vesicles form, why they are highly monodisperse and how they can coexist with much smaller micelles. The fairly small differences between the two copolymer species makes it difficult to distinguish between them experimentally, e.g., labeling the polymers is likely to perturb the co-assembly significantly. That is why progress on the experimental side is difficult.

From cou.: 8 Fortunately, the evidence that these systems are in a free energy minimum justifies a theoretical analysis aimed at understanding the equilibrium properties of these vesicle–micelle systems. With the above questions in mind we embarked on a detailed self-consistent field (SCF) analysis of this problem. The model that is used is tailored to the PBnPEm system, but we stress that our results are more generally applicable. In line with the early model of Andelman,9 it appears relatively straightforward to show that it is possible to find a regime where the mixing ratio between PB10PE10 and PB10PE18 is such that the respective chemical potentials for these species assembled in micelles is equal to that in vesicles. Hence, this allows us to confirm that these two states of assembly can indeed coexist. The size selection of the vesicles, however, is a more delicate issue. We present evidence that one should expect that the size of the vesicles is a strongly decreasing function of the PE18/PE10 ratio, giving support for the findings and interpretations of the SANS and cryo-TEM data. Although it is not yet possible to make strong quantitative predictions, we stress that many experimental aspects of these polymer mixtures are recovered by the model, e.g., regarding issues such as the size and size distribution of the micelles and the micelle concentration that coexist with the vesicles. Hence, the field theoretical modeling confirms our viewpoint that in these systems the small unilamellar vesicles are thermodynamically stable.

From cou.: 10 Here we present the SCF theory for (polymeric) self-assembly using the discretization scheme of Scheutjens and Fleer13,14 and apply this to a molecularly detailed model where the segments in the polymer chain are described on an united-atom level (the united-atoms are referred to as segments below). The theory has been extensively discussed in the literature, and we refer to this for most of the details.15,16 Here, we will only mention the main characteristics and approximations used. The parameters that are used for the PBnPEm copolymers in an aqueous solution are the same as those used for corresponding modeling of Pluronic polymers (also modeled on the united-atom level).17,18 Instead of propylene-oxide units in the latter, we now have polybutylene-oxide units with just one CH2 (united) atom extra in the side chain. One consequence of this is, obviously, that the PB unit is more hydrophobic than poly(propylene oxide). All molecular details (the model) and the parameters used are collected in a small paragraph presented below.

From cou.: 11 At the basis of the SCF theory is the mean-field free energy density f[{φ}, {u}](r) (we will reduce all energies by the thermal energy kBT). This notation implies that the free energy is a function of two conjugated quantities, namely the volume fraction φ(r) (dimensionless concentration), and the corresponding segment potential u(r). Both quantities are a function of the radial coordinate in the system r = 1, 2, …, M (we focus on the spherical geometry and trust that the modifications for other geometries are obvious), and thus f is a function of this radial coordinate as well. The curly brackets indicate that for each segment type in the system the (φ, u) pair is present. In our system segments are referred to with the index A. The solvent S (water): A = 1, segment C2 (representing CH2): A = 2, segment C3 (representing CH3): A = 3, segment O (representing oxygen atom and the terminal OH group): A = 4.

From cou.: 12 The mean-field free energy is written as F[{φ},{u}] = ∑rL(r)f[{φ},{u}](r), where L(r) is the dimensionless volume of the lattice layer (number of lattice site) r. We will reduce all lengths by the size of a lattice site b. For the spherical coordinate system we have L(r) ∝ r2. In all our calculations r = 0 will coincide with the center of mass of a spherical micelle or a spherical unilamellar vesicle (the two main target species of the calculations).

From cou.: 43 N
From Soup: 43 At this point we did not yet explain how we evaluate the partition function Q = Π i q n i i / n i !, where q i is the single-chain partition function, nor how we can compute the volume fractions from the segment potentials (other than the formal definition given by eqn (5) ). We have implemented a Markov approximation for this. This implies that the chain connectivity is accounted for, in such a way that the memory of the path of the chains is lost after each ‘propagating’ step. This means that it is not excluded that chains self-intersect. The combined statistical weight of all allowed walks is found by solving the Edwards diffusion equation (effectively, this leads to the Gaussian chain model). 20 On a lattice this procedure transforms into a set of complementary propagators, and the chain model is that of a freely-jointed chain. The propagator equations are very efficient in computing the volume fractions, because the number of operations is of order N . However, these propagators become somewhat involved for branched molecules, and therefore we sketch what is exactly done. We refer to the literature for full details. 21, 22
 ###### 
From cou.: 44 i
From Soup: 44 In short, the propagators generate the set of all allowed conformations, { c }, of the (branched) polymer ( solvent ) i , with segment ranking numbers s = 1, … N i and enumerates for each conformation c the sum of its segment potentials u c i = ∑ s u c i ( s ) (where u i c ( s ) is the segment potential felt by segment s of molecule i being in conformation c ). For a given conformation the coordinates of all segments, r s c , are specified and from the primary sequence of segments of the chain we know the segment type A of segment s (this is an input) and thus the value of u i c is evaluated straightforwardly using the segment potentials specified in eqn (4) . Next, the statistical weight of each conformation c is found by applying the Boltzmann law G i c = exp − u i c . From these weights it is then possible to generate the volume fraction profiles φ A ( r ) without further approximations. The volume fraction distributions are normalized such that the total number of chains in the system is consistent with the imposed value (in a closed system) or that the bulk volume fraction of the component equals the imposed value (semi-open system).
 ###### 
From cou.: 45 i
From Soup: 45 In summary, the SCF formalism specifies how to compute the volume fractions for given potentials and how the segment potentials follow from the volume fractions. The SCF solution is found iteratively. Routinely, we obtain a numerical accuracy better than 7 significant digits. As a result, we have detailed information on the (radial) volume fraction profiles of all molecular species in the system, and we have exact numerical values for the mean-field free energy of the system. The latter information is used to analyze the thermodynamic status of a particular SCF solution, which is explained next.

From cou.: 46 At this point we did not yet explain how we evaluate the partition function Q = Πiqnii/ni!, where qi is the single-chain partition function, nor how we can compute the volume fractions from the segment potentials (other than the formal definition given by eqn (5)). We have implemented a Markov approximation for this. This implies that the chain connectivity is accounted for, in such a way that the memory of the path of the chains is lost after each ‘propagating’ step.

From Soup: 46 From a classical thermodynamic analysis of mixtures of amphiphiles in a selective solvent one cannot obtain details on the molecular level on how molecules interact with each other. Instead it gives well-known laws for macroscopic equilibrium, for example, that there can be no spatial gradients in the chemical potential of the components in the system. Our interest is in the case that copolymers partition between a free state in solution, being assembled into spherical (or worm like) micelles and/or in vesicles . This can only happen if the chemical potential of the molecular species in all these states is identical. We will use this criterion below.
 ###### 
From cou.: 47 In short, the propagators generate the set of all allowed conformations, {c}, of the (branched) polymer (solvent) i, with segment ranking numbers s = 1, … Ni and enumerates for each conformation c the sum of its segment potentials uci = ∑suci(s) (where uic(s) is the segment potential felt by segment s of molecule i being in conformation c). For a given conformation the coordinates of all segments, rsc, are specified and from the primary sequence of segments of the chain we know the segment type A of segment s (this is an input) and thus the value of uic is evaluated straightforwardly using the segment potentials specified in eqn (4). Next, the statistical weight of each conformation c is found by applying the Boltzmann law Gic = exp − uic. From these weights it is then possible to generate the volume fraction profiles φA(r) without further approximations. The volume fraction distributions are normalized such that the total number of chains in the system is consistent with the imposed value (in a closed system) or that the bulk volume fraction of the component equals the imposed value (semi-open system).
From Soup: 47 To make further progress, one has to focus on what happens in the system on a length scale of the micelles or vesicles . This is the realm of the thermodynamics of small systems and statistical thermodynamics. 23 In SCF modeling one has to start by choosing the geometry of the coordinate system. For example, a spherical coordinate system is used to study spherical micelles and vesicles , the cylindrical coordinate system is used to model the linear micelles (worm like micelles) and the (ordinary) flat coordinate system is applicable for bilayers. When our interest is in knowing which of the aggregate types is thermodynamically the most favorable, one has to consider the chemical potentials of the molecules that are observed in all these cases. The aggregates with the lowest chemical potentials are the preferred ones. Hence, in an SCF calculation it is possible, by choosing, e.g. , the wrong geometry to obtain detailed information on the aggregation properties of the copolymers that would not have formed spontaneously. Inversely, it is possible that in an SCF analysis a particular aggregation type is claimed to be most favorable, while the best aggregated state has been overlooked. A full analysis is therefore not trivial and various complementary calculations are always needed before strong conclusions can be drawn.
 ###### 
From cou.: 48 In summary, the SCF formalism specifies how to compute the volume fractions for given potentials and how the segment potentials follow from the volume fractions. The SCF solution is found iteratively. Routinely, we obtain a numerical accuracy better than 7 significant digits. As a result, we have detailed information on the (radial) volume fraction profiles of all molecular species in the system, and we have exact numerical values for the mean-field free energy of the system. The latter information is used to analyze the thermodynamic status of a particular SCF solution, which is explained next.
From Soup: 48 To judge equilibrium, it appears that the grand potential ε that is associated to the presence of the aggregates is a key quantity of interest. The grand potential of a self-assembled object is the intensive variable conjugated to the number of such objects. It is important to mention that this number is not fixed and optimizing the system free energy with respect to the number of objects leads to the conclusion that ε = 0. 24, 25 In other words, the free energy of the micellar system must be equal to F = ∑ i n i µ i − pV .
 ###### 
From cou.: 49 From a classical thermodynamic analysis of mixtures of amphiphiles in a selective solvent one cannot obtain details on the molecular level on how molecules interact with each other. Instead it gives well-known laws for macroscopic equilibrium, for example, that there can be no spatial gradients in the chemical potential of the components in the system. Our interest is in the case that copolymers partition between a free state in solution, being assembled into spherical (or worm like) micelles and/or in vesicles. This can only happen if the chemical potential of the molecular species in all these states is identical. We will use this criterion below.
From Soup: 49 In the computational volume of a typical SCF analysis a micelle as well as a vesicle has no translational degrees of freedom, as these are fixed with their center of mass to the center of the coordinate system. The grand potential that is evaluated after solving the SCF equations is, for a single object, given by ε m . As the micelles are fixed to the center of the coordinate system, we must insist that ε m > 0. Assuming that only translational degrees of freedom on the micelle or vesicle length scale are ignored we may write (recall, all terms are reduced by k B T ):
 ###### 
From cou.: 50 To make further progress, one has to focus on what happens in the system on a length scale of the micelles or vesicles. This is the realm of the thermodynamics of small systems and statistical thermodynamics.23 In SCF modeling one has to start by choosing the geometry of the coordinate system. For example, a spherical coordinate system is used to study spherical micelles and vesicles, the cylindrical coordinate system is used to model the linear micelles (worm like micelles) and the (ordinary) flat coordinate system is applicable for bilayers. When our interest is in knowing which of the aggregate types is thermodynamically the most favorable, one has to consider the chemical potentials of the molecules that are observed in all these cases. The aggregates with the lowest chemical potentials are the preferred ones. Hence, in an SCF calculation it is possible, by choosing, e.g., the wrong geometry to obtain detailed information on the aggregation properties of the copolymers that would not have formed spontaneously. Inversely, it is possible that in an SCF analysis a particular aggregation type is claimed to be most favorable, while the best aggregated state has been overlooked. A full analysis is therefore not trivial and various complementary calculations are always needed before strong conclusions can be drawn.
From Soup: 50 Here ϕ is the volume fraction of micelles ( vesicles ). Alternatively, ε may be interpreted as the excess chemical potential that can be associated to a micelle (which must be zero), ln ϕ is – TS translation / k B T and ε m is the free energy of formation of the micelle. As the excess chemical potential per micelle is zero, we have ϕ = exp(−ε m ). 24
 ###### 
From cou.: 51 To judge equilibrium, it appears that the grand potential ε that is associated to the presence of the aggregates is a key quantity of interest. The grand potential of a self-assembled object is the intensive variable conjugated to the number of such objects. It is important to mention that this number is not fixed and optimizing the system free energy with respect to the number of objects leads to the conclusion that ε = 0.24, 25 In other words, the free energy of the micellar system must be equal to F = ∑iniµi − pV.
From Soup: 51 Of course eqn (8) has only limited applicability. In the context of a micellar system, we clearly ignored the entropy associated with size and shape distributions. For vesicles , the main extra approximation is that eqn (8) ignored the entropy that is present in the membrane undulations. Hence, the application of eqn (8) gives only an indicative value of the micelle/ vesicle volume fractions. Therefore, we will not insist on the accuracy of the book keeping in terms of the full distribution of polymers over the micelles, vesicles and freely floating in solution. Hence, strong quantitative predictions are, at the current state of matter, out of reach. Instead we will use eqn (8) to obtain an order of magnitude of the micelle/ vesicle concentrations.

From Soup: 52 Even though the SCF modeling focuses on most-likely micelles/ vesicles , and although in the ‘simulation’ volume just one micelle/ vesicle is present, we can estimate, e.g. the fluctuations in the micelle size from evaluating how much the aggregation number changes with small changes in the chemical potential(s). In multi-component systems such analysis is already more complex than in single component systems so we will only qualitatively apply this information.

Alternatively, ε may be interpreted as the excess chemical potential that can be associated to a micelle (which must be zero), lnϕ is – TStranslation/kBT and εm is the free energy of formation of the micelle. As the excess chemical potential per micelle is zero, we have ϕ = exp(−εm).24

These sites are arranged in a ‘star’ configuration, i.e. a central ‘segment’ is surrounded by 4 neighbors. The motivation for doing this is to mimic the fact that water forms, through its H -bonding capabilities, small clusters . These clusters are invariably larger than, e.g. , a united atom CH 2 . We arbitrarily have chosen for a size ratio of 5. We haste to mention that this is a very primitive model for water . In the model the ‘segment’ type of water is denoted by S.

From Soup: 59 Note that both copolymers have an equal length of the hydrophobic part. This is an important property of our system. The similar length of the PB part will guarantee that the two copolymers mix ideally with each other.

From Soup: 60 The list of FH χ parameters used in the study are collected in Table 1 . The interaction parameters with the solvent S are most relevant for the starting and stopping mechanism of self-assembly . The C3 unit (the final segment in the side groups ) is taken somewhat more hydrophobic than the C2 ones. The negative value of χ SO indicates that the oxygen really likes to be solvated by water . In a previous study we argued that this parameter is the one that responds to the temperature, a more negative value implies a lower temperature. The current value is chosen so that the self-assembly is somewhere in between the critical micellisation temperature (CMT) and the cloud point temperature (CPT). We further implemented a small repulsion between C2 and C3, which is the same as in previous studies. There is a further significant repulsion between O and the apolar units χ OC3 = χ OC2 = 2. This repulsion helps to separate the PE block from the PB one and this repulsion adds to the stability of the micelles/ vesicles . Again, these parameters have been used before to model the self-assembly of Pluronic polymers . They reproduced the proper trends, e.g. , for the CMC as a function of the lengths of the PPO and PEO blocks and also the trends for CMT and CPT. 17,18 We haste to mention however, that the present set is not necessarily the best possible one. Although small changes in the parameters will give quantitatively different results, we have checked that the qualitative effects remain the same when the parameters are modified (within reasonable limits of course).

We will see that PB 10 PE 18 forms spherical micelles and that PB 10 PE 10 strongly prefers the lamellar topology. We then move on to the binary mixtures, establish a diagram of states, and identify the region of micelle/ vesicle coexistence.

The concentration of the latter is invariably close to the critical micelle concentration. From this it is clear that not all compositions that are used will lead to meaningful micelles or vesicles . We need the thermodynamic arguments to select the relevant cases. More specifically we need to analyze the grand potential and the chemical potentials.

The accompanying Fig. 1b gives the corresponding bulk volume fractions of polymers that are in equilibrium with the micelles on a log-lin scale. The quantities plotted in panels (a) and (b) are related through the Gibbs–Duhem relationship ∂ε m /∂ ln φ b = − g . As the fluctuations in the aggregation number in the micelle size are necessarily positive, we should focus on the aggregation numbers for which ∂ g /∂ µ > 0. This coincides with the requirement ∂ε m /∂ g < 0. There are a number of important predictions that can be extracted from these graphs: 17

From Soup: 66 The maximum in ε m ( g ) corresponds to the first appearance of stable micelles in the system. The corresponding minimum in φ b ( g ) thus corresponds to the (theoretical) CMC. The volume fraction of micelles at this theoretical CMC may be computed from eqn (8) and is much smaller for the PE 10 than for the PE 18 copolymers . The aggregation numbers for these first micelles appears to be roughly the same for the two copolymers ( g ≈ 50); it is slightly smaller for the PE 18 species than for the PE 10 one.

 ###### 
From cou.: 68 1. Theoretical CMC.
From Soup: 68 Depending on the measuring technique, we expect that one can experimentally see micelles above some threshold ϕ (below some threshold ε m ). Quite arbitrarily one may choose micelles with ε m < 10 as micelles that are experimentally observable. Following this criterion we thus expect that the first micelles that can be measured for the PE 18 polymer have a twice lower aggregation number than those of PE 10 .

 ###### 
From cou.: 70 2. Experimental CMC.
From Soup: 70 The CMC is to first-order a function of the length of the hydrophobic block. As both copolymers have the same ‘tail’ length, we expect the CMC to be roughly the same. To second order it should be an increasing function of the length of the polar block. Hence we expect the CMC to be lower for the PE 10 than for the PE 18 copolymer . Indeed this is what is observed ( cf. Fig. 1b ): there is a difference in CMC by a factor of about two.

 ###### 
From cou.: 72 3. The CMC.
From Soup: 72 The minimum in ε m ( g ) found for the PE 10 around g ≈ 225 indicates that it is not possible to obtain a high concentration of those micelles: application of eqn (8) implies that ϕ goes through a maximum. This indicates that this system is close to the cloud point. 18 For sufficiently high copolymer concentrations one must expect a condensed phase of copolymers (often this is the lamellar phase). A similar minimum does not appear for the PE 18 copolymer system, indicating that the longer hydrophilic block keeps the micelles stable up to higher micelle concentrations. This system is well below its cloud point temperature.

From Soup: 74 From Fig. 1b we can directly estimate the fluctuations of the micelle size for micelles with a given average g , by taking the inverse of the slope of the curves (at the specified g ). 17 Clearly the PE 10 micelles have significantly larger size fluctuations than the PE 18 ones. We will return to this property below.

 ###### 
From cou.: 76 5. Fluctuation in micelle size.
From Soup: 76 From Fig. 1b we find that with increasing polymer concentrations the micelles will grow slightly (only by a factor of approximately two) and at the same time the chemical potential increases slightly as well, but the micelle concentration increases exponentially (ε m ( g ) decreases linearly with g ). At some threshold polymer concentration the chemical potential will reach the value for which worm-like micelles become stable. In Fig. 1b we have indicated these bulk volume fractions of the copolymers by the arrows that point downwards. These concentrations were obtained from analyzing micellisation in the cylindrical coordinate system (not shown). In Fig. 1a one can find the grand potential of the micelles that coexist with the worm-like micelles. To first-order this grand potential is equal to the so-called end-cap energy. 26 Around the appearance of the worm-like micelles the system switches its strategy (instead of increasing the number of micelles, it increases the length of the worm-like micelles). This change in strategy is easily seen in experiments and the concentration of copolymers where this happens is known as the second CMC. Worm-like micelles should have a positive value for the end-cap energy and we conclude that only for the PE 10 species the spherical micelles can potentially coexist with worm-like micelles. The PE 18 polymer has a negative end cap energy and thus these copolymers form spherical micelles up to very high polymer concentrations.

From cou.: 77 From Fig. 1b we can directly estimate the fluctuations of the micelle size for micelles with a given average g, by taking the inverse of the slope of the curves (at the specified g).17 Clearly the PE10 micelles have significantly larger size fluctuations than the PE18 ones. We will return to this property below.
From Soup: 77 7. Stability of tensionless bilayers.
 ###### 
From cou.: 78 6. The second CMC.
From Soup: 78 For both copolymers we have also considered the stability of tensionless flat bilayers. 27 The bulk volume fractions of the surfactants that are found in this case are also presented in Fig. 1b , i.e. , by the arrow pointing upward. We note that large vesicles exist at virtually the same chemical potential (ln φ b ) as the tensionless flat bilayers and thus, we may already speculate on the possible coexistence of spherical micelles with vesicles (similarly as worm-like micelles coexist with spherical micelles). However, from Fig. 1b we conclude that, for the PE 18 polymer , the bulk concentration of polymers that co-exists with bilayers (arrow pointing upward) is even higher than that for the worm-like micelle. Hence, there is no possibility to have coexistence between spherical micelles and vesicles . Indeed, when we model spherical vesicles composed of PE 18 only (not shown), we find that the curvature energy of the vesicle is negative ( Fig. 3c ). This clearly points to the instability of the bilayer configuration for the PE 18 chains. The situation is completely different for the PE 10 copolymer . In this case the bulk concentration of surfactant that coexists with bilayers is lower than that for worm-like micelles. Hence, it is not possible to form worm-like micelles for this surfactant , as speculated above. Instead, bilayers should form first. The volume fraction of micelles (as can be estimated from using eqn (8) ) that coexists with bilayers ( vesicles ) is extremely low (below the experimental CMC), so that in practice it will be very difficult to observe such coexistence. This might explain why this phenomenon has not been discussed in the literature.

From cou.: 79 From Fig. 1b we find that with increasing polymer concentrations the micelles will grow slightly (only by a factor of approximately two) and at the same time the chemical potential increases slightly as well, but the micelle concentration increases exponentially (εm(g) decreases linearly with g). At some threshold polymer concentration the chemical potential will reach the value for which worm-like micelles become stable.

Worm-like micelles should have a positive value for the end-cap energy and we conclude that only for the PE10 species the spherical micelles can potentially coexist with worm-like micelles. The PE18 polymer has a negative end cap energy and thus these copolymers form spherical micelles up to very high polymer concentrations.
From Soup: 79 We have seen that the interpretations based on the results of Fig. 1 are in close correspondence with known behavior for surfactant and copolymer micellisation in general. 28 More specifically, the results prove to be in excellent agreement with experimental observations that the PE 18 copolymer readily forms micelles and that the micelles are rather monodisperse up to a very high copolymer concentration. On the other hand, the PE 10 polymer is just forming lamellae and in the absence of repulsion between the membranes (not shown), we should expect that a lamellar phase, or an onion phase (multilamellar vesicles ) is formed. We will see next that the analysis becomes slightly more involved in binary polymer mixtures.
 ###### 
From cou.: 80 7. Stability of tensionless bilayers.
From Soup: 80 In binary systems it appears necessary to define how much of the (10, 10) and (10, 18) copolymers we have in the assemblies . This can be done in various ways. Here, we choose to do this by computing the amount θ σ i of segments of each type that is in excess in the micelles. The ratio of these is computed from where copolymer i = 1 (10, 10) is given the subindex (10), and i = 2 (10, 18) the subindex (18) for obvious reasons (the same we do for other quantities below).
 ###### 
From cou.: 81 For both copolymers we have also considered the stability of tensionless flat bilayers.27 The bulk volume fractions of the surfactants that are found in this case are also presented in Fig. 1b, i.e., by the arrow pointing upward. We note that large vesicles exist at virtually the same chemical potential (lnφb) as the tensionless flat bilayers and thus, we may already speculate on the possible coexistence of spherical micelles with vesicles (similarly as worm-like micelles coexist with spherical micelles). However, from Fig. 1b we conclude that, for the PE18 polymer, the bulk concentration of polymers that co-exists with bilayers (arrow pointing upward) is even higher than that for the worm-like micelle. Hence, there is no possibility to have coexistence between spherical micelles and vesicles. Indeed, when we model spherical vesicles composed of PE18 only (not shown), we find that the curvature energy of the vesicle is negative (Fig. 3c). This clearly points to the instability of the bilayer configuration for the PE18 chains. The situation is completely different for the PE10 copolymer. In this case the bulk concentration of surfactant that coexists with bilayers is lower than that for worm-like micelles. Hence, it is not possible to form worm-like micelles for this surfactant, as speculated above. Instead, bilayers should form first. The volume fraction of micelles (as can be estimated from using eqn (8)) that coexists with bilayers (vesicles) is extremely low (below the experimental CMC), so that in practice it will be very difficult to observe such coexistence. This might explain why this phenomenon has not been discussed in the literature.
From Soup: 81 Mixing the two copolymers with fractions x 18 and x 10 (sum is unity) may to first-order be a way to mimic the performance of a copolymer with an intermediate head group size 〈 m 〉=18 x 18 + 10 x 10 . However, there are various issues that complicate matters, namely that the partitioning of the two copolymers between micelle and bulk, or between vesicle and bulk is not the same. Nor do we expect that at a given set of chemical potentials the ratio θ σ 18 / θ σ 10 in the micelle is identical to that in the vesicle . For this reason we choose to work explicitly with copolymer mixtures rather than to mimic the mixture with some ‘effective’ copolymer .

From cou.: 82 We have seen that the interpretations based on the results of Fig. 1 are in close correspondence with known behavior for surfactant and copolymer micellisation in general.28 More specifically, the results prove to be in excellent agreement with experimental observations that the PE18 copolymer readily forms micelles and that the micelles are rather monodisperse up to a very high copolymer concentration. On the other hand, the PE10 polymer is just forming lamellae and in the absence of repulsion between the membranes (not shown), we should expect that a lamellar phase, or an onion phase (multilamellar vesicles) is formed. We will see next that the analysis becomes slightly more involved in binary polymer mixtures.
From Soup: 82 In the present system it appears not so difficult to find situations where vesicles coexist with micelles. Let us first present typical radial volume fraction profiles for such a system. Radial profiles for mixed vesicles and mixed micelles are shown in Fig. 2a,b , respectively. An important point is that in both systems the chemical potentials match; in both systems the bulk concentration of PB 10 PE 18 and PB 10 PE 10 are identical, φ b 18 (micelle) = φ b 18 (vesicle) and φ b 10 (micelle) = φ b 10 (vesicle). This system corresponds to the points indicated by the arrows in Fig. 3 .
 ###### 
From cou.: 83 In binary systems it appears necessary to define how much of the (10, 10) and (10, 18) copolymers we have in the assemblies. This can be done in various ways. Here, we choose to do this by computing the amount θσi of segments of each type that is in excess in the micelles. The ratio of these is computed fromwhere copolymer i = 1 (10, 10) is given the subindex (10), and i = 2 (10, 18) the subindex (18) for obvious reasons (the same we do for other quantities below).
From Soup: 83 In Fig. 2a we present a radial distribution through a curved bilayer ( vesicle ). The center of the vesicle is at r = 0 hence in this example we have chosen for a vesicle with a very small radius of R ≈ 50. This is done deliberately because it allows us to discuss several features of curved bilayers in binary copolymer mixtures. For example, it is found that the PE 18 chains extend slightly further out away from the core, while the PE 10 chain remains closer to the core. From polymer brush theory these effects are well known. 29 As compared to the homodisperse systems, the PE 10 has a compressed conformation and the PE 18 is somewhat over-stretched in a so-called flower conformation. More important for the present system, are the differences in profile found for the inner and outer membrane leaflet. Such differences are attributed to the curvature of the bilayer. Intuitively one would expect the PE 18 to be preferentially in the outer leaflet and the PE 10 in the inner one. Indeed this is the case, but the differences in composition between inner and outer leaflet are minute. Secondly, focusing again on the PE part, we expect the overall volume fraction to be higher on the inside leaflet than on the outer one. Because of the high curvature, one can indeed observe this in Fig. 2a . The higher packing density in the inner leaflet causes the PE 18 tails to be more clearly in the flower-conformation. They extend further away from the core in the inner leaflet than in the outer one. In the core there are also salient features that can be attributed to the curvature. For example, the core-density is not exactly homogeneous; it is slightly higher on the outside than on the inside. Such effects are well known and we do not discuss these effects here further. 30–32
 ###### 
From cou.: 84 Mixing the two copolymers with fractions x18 and x10 (sum is unity) may to first-order be a way to mimic the performance of a copolymer with an intermediate head group size 〈m〉=18x18 + 10x10. However, there are various issues that complicate matters, namely that the partitioning of the two copolymers between micelle and bulk, or between vesicle and bulk is not the same. Nor do we expect that at a given set of chemical potentials the ratio θσ18/θσ10 in the micelle is identical to that in the vesicle. For this reason we choose to work explicitly with copolymer mixtures rather than to mimic the mixture with some ‘effective’ copolymer.
From Soup: 84 The radial volume fraction profiles of mixed micelles, shown in Fig. 2b , also have several noteworthy features that need to be discussed. In a small spherical micelle there is a strong curvature of the interface. Hence, we expect that the micelle is preferentially populated by the PE 18 chains and that the PE 10 chains are suppressed, e.g. , in comparison to the composition in the vesicles (recall that the chemical potentials are fixed). This is indeed the case, but again, the partitioning is far from complete and clearly we have an example of a mixed micelle. Focusing once more on the corona of the micelle, we see qualitatively the same phenomenon as already discussed for the vesicle . The PE 18 chain extends further away from the core than the PE 10 one. Again the PE 18 have the flower-conformation and these chain parts force the PE 10 parts to remain near the core. Quite unexpectedly, it is observed that some of the PE groups of the (10, 10) copolymers are pushed into the core. This does not happen with the PE 18 chain parts. The occurrence of head groups inside the core in a non-trivial distribution is often the sign that the spherical micelle has a problem and that there might be significant micelle-shape fluctuations (which allow the micelles to prevent the head groups to be in the core). We extensively looked for these. Indeed we found that small disks may be generated for which the copolymers have nearly the same chemical potentials as those of the current micelles. The same is true for small dumbbells (short worms). Hence these type of shapes should occur as fluctuations. However, also in the disk edges as well as in the end-caps of the worms the same phenomenon is observed, namely that PE 10 chains are partitioned inside the core. We thus conclude that this is a feature of the present mixture of copolymers . We may attribute this to the finite miscibility of PE groups in a PB rich region. The fact that the two monomer units only differ with respect to the (rather small) side group may possibly facilitate this. Apparently, the PB and PE are not as strongly segregating as is the case, e.g. , in charged surfactant systems where head and tail regions are strictly separated. 33

From cou.: 85 In the present system it appears not so difficult to find situations where vesicles coexist with micelles. Let us first present typical radial volume fraction profiles for such a system. Radial profiles for mixed vesicles and mixed micelles are shown in Fig. 2a,b, respectively. An important point is that in both systems the chemical potentials match; in both systems the bulk concentration of PB10PE18 and PB10PE10 are identical, φb18(micelle) = φb18(vesicle) and φb10(micelle) = φb10(vesicle). This system corresponds to the points indicated by the arrows in Fig. 3.
From Soup: 85 At this point we may speculate that the presence of PE chain parts in the micelle center is one of the reasons that the system chooses for a coexistence between micelles and vesicles . Upon an increase in loading of the (10, 18) spherical micelle with (10, 10) copolymers , the PE 10 chain parts are ‘pushed’ into the micelle core. This gradually destabilizes the spherical micelle, so that the micelle-to- vesicle transition starts.

From Soup: 86 It turns out that by varying the ratio between the two polymers , one can precisely enter the region where only vesicle , only micelle or both aggregates are present and the relevant compositions of the vesicles is such that the (10, 18) is in the minority, i.e. , θ σ 18 < θ σ 10 . Again, as in a given SCF calculation there is just one (most-likely) aggregate present, one has to identify these regions from analyzing the thermodynamic information of these systems. In Fig. 3a,c data for the vesicles and in Fig. 3b,d the information for mixed micelles is presented. The first two panels (a, b) focus on the bulk volume fractions (chemical potentials), whereas panels (c) and (d) present the corresponding grand potentials.

From Soup: 87 Conceptually, it is more easy to understand how the calculations proceed for the vesicle case and therefore we will explain these results first. As discussed above already, it suffices to specify for a given volume of the system (with spherical geometry) the number of molecules of all components to obtain a unique SCF solution. In this case we first estimate how many molecules we need for the vesicle to have a radius of approximately R ≈ 100, and then do a series of calculations for which x 18 and x 10 is varied. We then compute the ratio of the excess quantities and evaluate the grand potential as well as the chemical potentials. These quantities are presented in Fig. 3a,c .
 ###### 
From cou.: 88 At this point we may speculate that the presence of PE chain parts in the micelle center is one of the reasons that the system chooses for a coexistence between micelles and vesicles. Upon an increase in loading of the (10, 18) spherical micelle with (10, 10) copolymers, the PE10 chain parts are ‘pushed’ into the micelle core. This gradually destabilizes the spherical micelle, so that the micelle-to-vesicle transition starts.
From Soup: 88 As is seen in Fig. 3a the bulk volume fraction of (10, 18) increases, and that of (10, 10) decreases upon an increase of the ratio of amounts of PB 18 /PB 10 in the vesicle . The increase of the bulk volume fraction of (10, 18) is expected, because when θ σ 18 ≫ θ σ 10 , the amount of (10, 18) in the system is initially very small (sub CMC) and grows towards CMC-values. The decrease of the bulk volume fraction of (10, 10) is less trivial. Indeed, upon the gradual loading of the vesicles with (10, 18), the membrane thickness decreases gradually and this is favorable for the packing of the (10, 10). More specifically, this molecule does not need to stretch as much as in the pure (10, 10) bilayers. Correspondingly, the grand potential of the vesicle decreases with increasing presence of (10, 18), i.e. , with increasing θ σ 18 / θ σ 10 as is shown in Fig. 3c . For spherical vesicles the grand potential can be decomposed into ε m = 4π(2 k c + ), where k c is the mean and the Gaussian bending modulus. 34,35 Hence, we see that the effective bending modulus = 2 k c + is decreasing by about a factor of two upon an increase of the loading of (10, 18) into (10, 10), up to the 1 : 1 ratio. This does not necessarily mean the same change in respective values of k c or . We will return to this below.
 ###### 
From cou.: 89 It turns out that by varying the ratio between the two polymers, one can precisely enter the region where only vesicle, only micelle or both aggregates are present and the relevant compositions of the vesicles is such that the (10, 18) is in the minority, i.e., θσ18 < θσ10. Again, as in a given SCF calculation there is just one (most-likely) aggregate present, one has to identify these regions from analyzing the thermodynamic information of these systems. In Fig. 3a,c data for the vesicles and in Fig. 3b,d the information for mixed micelles is presented. The first two panels (a, b) focus on the bulk volume fractions (chemical potentials), whereas panels (c) and (d) present the corresponding grand potentials.
From Soup: 89 We now would like to identify those vesicles that coexist with micelles. As in the calculations of the micelles, one needs to specify the amount of molecules for at least one component, we choose for the following strategy. Using results presented in Fig. 3a we select a relevant value for the bulk concentration of PB 10 PE 10 , and then fix this value in the calculations of micelles. The number of copolymers of the type PB 10 PE 18 is varied in an attempt to find a matching bulk volume fraction of surfactant for the (10, 18) copolymer . Upon increasing loading of PB 10 PE 18 in the micelles we obtain data similarly as given in Fig. 1 . Here we choose to present the results in Fig. 3b where the dotted line gives the bulk volume fraction of PB 10 PE 18 as a function of the ratio θ σ 18 / θ σ 10 in the micelle. The corresponding curve of ε m ( θ σ 18 / θ σ 10 ) is presented in Fig. 3d . This procedure is repeated several times for (slightly) different values of the bulk concentration of PB 10 PE 10 . In favorable cases there exists one point along a given (dotted) curve of Fig. 3b for which the bulk volume fraction of PB 10 PE 18 exactly matches the value needed for coexistence. The points for which a successful match of chemical potentials was found are connected by the solid line in Fig. 3b . In Fig. 3d the corresponding grand potential curves are presented, and again the solid line connects those points on the curves for which a successful match of the chemical potentials was possible.

From cou.: 90 Conceptually, it is more easy to understand how the calculations proceed for the vesicle case and therefore we will explain these results first. As discussed above already, it suffices to specify for a given volume of the system (with spherical geometry) the number of molecules of all components to obtain a unique SCF solution. In this case we first estimate how many molecules we need for the vesicle to have a radius of approximately R ≈ 100, and then do a series of calculations for which x18 and x10 is varied. We then compute the ratio of the excess quantities and evaluate the grand potential as well as the chemical potentials. These quantities are presented in Fig. 3a,c.
From Soup: 90 Focusing on the solid line in Fig. 3b , we see that with increasing loading of the micelles with (10, 18), the bulk volume fractions of (10, 18) increase as expected. It appears that we can only find a match of the chemical potentials in a specific composition regime. The upper and lower limits of coexistence are presented as vertical lines in Fig. 3c . Turning our attention to the grand potentials of the micelles for which the matching was possible, we see that the grand potential decreases almost linearly with increasing θ σ 18 / θ σ 10 , Fig. 3d . More striking is the fact that the grand potential of the micelles is rather low: the grand potential equals ε m ≈ 10 for the first time we can find coexistence ( θ σ 18 / θ σ 10 ≈ 0.3), and it vanishes (ε m = 0) around θ σ 18 / θ σ 10 ≈ 0.75. Using again eqn (8) we see that the micelle concentration ϕ , initially is still fairly low (near the CMC ϕ ≈ 10 −4 ), but with increasing amounts of (10, 18) copolymers in the system the volume fraction of micelles that coexists with the vesicles becomes very high indeed. A key observation is that in this situation most of the copolymers reside in micelles and only a minority in the vesicles . When the concentration of micelles approaches unity (ε m →0), all aggregates must be micelles and no vesicles can form. This is the upper boundary of vesicle -to-micelle coexistence.
 ###### 
From cou.: 91 As is seen in Fig. 3a the bulk volume fraction of (10, 18) increases, and that of (10, 10) decreases upon an increase of the ratio of amounts of PB18/PB10 in the vesicle. The increase of the bulk volume fraction of (10, 18) is expected, because when θσ18 ≫ θσ10, the amount of (10, 18) in the system is initially very small (sub CMC) and grows towards CMC-values. The decrease of the bulk volume fraction of (10, 10) is less trivial. Indeed, upon the gradual loading of the vesicles with (10, 18), the membrane thickness decreases gradually and this is favorable for the packing of the (10, 10). More specifically, this molecule does not need to stretch as much as in the pure (10, 10) bilayers. Correspondingly, the grand potential of the vesicle decreases with increasing presence of (10, 18), i.e., with increasing θσ18/θσ10 as is shown in Fig. 3c. For spherical vesicles the grand potential can be decomposed into εm = 4π(2kc + ), where kc is the mean and the Gaussian bending modulus.34,35 Hence, we see that the effective bending modulus = 2kc + is decreasing by about a factor of two upon an increase of the loading of (10, 18) into (10, 10), up to the 1 : 1 ratio. This does not necessarily mean the same change in respective values of kc or . We will return to this below.
From Soup: 91 Let us summarize by discussing the diagram of states. Referring to Fig. 3c , the vesicle with a low loading of (10, 18), (indicated by the letter V), is found when only vesicles are present. Above a threshold fraction of (10, 18) chains in the system we only have micelles (indicated by M). At intermediate cases we have micelle-to- vesicle coexistence (indicated by V + M). The fact that vesicles coexist with a relatively high concentration of micelles is consistent with the experimental data .
 ###### 
From cou.: 92 We now would like to identify those vesicles that coexist with micelles. As in the calculations of the micelles, one needs to specify the amount of molecules for at least one component, we choose for the following strategy. Using results presented in Fig. 3a we select a relevant value for the bulk concentration of PB10PE10, and then fix this value in the calculations of micelles. The number of copolymers of the type PB10PE18 is varied in an attempt to find a matching bulk volume fraction of surfactant for the (10, 18) copolymer. Upon increasing loading of PB10PE18 in the micelles we obtain data similarly as given in Fig. 1. Here we choose to present the results in Fig. 3b where the dotted line gives the bulk volume fraction of PB10PE18 as a function of the ratio θσ18/θσ10 in the micelle. The corresponding curve of εm(θσ18/θσ10) is presented in Fig. 3d. This procedure is repeated several times for (slightly) different values of the bulk concentration of PB10PE10. In favorable cases there exists one point along a given (dotted) curve of Fig. 3b for which the bulk volume fraction of PB10PE18 exactly matches the value needed for coexistence. The points for which a successful match of chemical potentials was found are connected by the solid line in Fig. 3b. In Fig. 3d the corresponding grand potential curves are presented, and again the solid line connects those points on the curves for which a successful match of the chemical potentials was possible.
From Soup: 92 Turning once again to results of Fig. 3 we notice that, at coexistence, the molecular composition of the micelles and that of the vesicles differ significantly. More specifically, we find θ σ 18 / θ σ 10 (micelle) ≈ 1.4 θ σ 18 / θ σ 10 ( vesicle ). This result was already discussed in Fig. 1 , but we see that the difference in composition is significant for all the coexisting micelle/ vesicle systems. The fact that the micelles are relatively rich in (10, 18) and the vesicles are rich in (10, 10) might have been expected from rather general considerations. 36
 ###### 
From cou.: 93 Focusing on the solid line in Fig. 3b, we see that with increasing loading of the micelles with (10, 18), the bulk volume fractions of (10, 18) increase as expected. It appears that we can only find a match of the chemical potentials in a specific composition regime. The upper and lower limits of coexistence are presented as vertical lines in Fig. 3c. Turning our attention to the grand potentials of the micelles for which the matching was possible, we see that the grand potential decreases almost linearly with increasing θσ18/θσ10, Fig. 3d. More striking is the fact that the grand potential of the micelles is rather low: the grand potential equals εm ≈ 10 for the first time we can find coexistence (θσ18/θσ10 ≈ 0.3), and it vanishes (εm = 0) around θσ18/θσ10 ≈ 0.75. Using again eqn (8) we see that the micelle concentration ϕ, initially is still fairly low (near the CMC ϕ ≈ 10−4), but with increasing amounts of (10, 18) copolymers in the system the volume fraction of micelles that coexists with the vesicles becomes very high indeed. A key observation is that in this situation most of the copolymers reside in micelles and only a minority in the vesicles. When the concentration of micelles approaches unity (εm→0), all aggregates must be micelles and no vesicles can form. This is the upper boundary of vesicle-to-micelle coexistence.
From Soup: 93 Above we have seen that upon an increase of the fraction (10, 18) in the system the grand potential of the micelles that coexist with vesicles decreases. At the same time the chemical potential (bulk volume fraction) of (10, 18) increases. On the other hand, the chemical potential of the (10, 10) copolymer decreases (slightly). At this stage it is not trivial to ascertain whether the size of the micelle, in terms of the total amount of copolymers ( g = θ σ 18 / N 18 + θ σ 10 / N 10 ), is an increasing function of the (10, 18) concentration or not. As can be seen in Fig. 4 the model predicts that the overall molecular weight of the micelle increases with increasing ratio θ σ 18 / θ σ 10 , and hence the overall micelle aggregation number increases with increasing overall micelle concentration ( cf Fig. 3d ). Again, this result is in line with the experimental data , 12 albeit that in the experiments the increase in micellar mass is somewhat more pronounced. The reason for this is discussed below.
 ###### 
From cou.: 94 Let us summarize by discussing the diagram of states. Referring to Fig. 3c, the vesicle with a low loading of (10, 18), (indicated by the letter V), is found when only vesicles are present. Above a threshold fraction of (10, 18) chains in the system we only have micelles (indicated by M). At intermediate cases we have micelle-to-vesicle coexistence (indicated by V + M). The fact that vesicles coexist with a relatively high concentration of micelles is consistent with the experimental data.
From Soup: 94 From the experiments we further know that the width of the micelle size distribution is somewhat larger for lower polymer concentrations. We may understand this from our results as well. For a lower overall polymer concentration the micelle concentration is lower and the composition of the coexisting micelles shifts to a lower loading with (10, 18). From Fig. 1 we know that micelles rich in (10, 10) have a higher degree of polydispersity than micelles rich in (10, 18).
 ###### 
From cou.: 95 Turning once again to results of Fig. 3 we notice that, at coexistence, the molecular composition of the micelles and that of the vesicles differ significantly. More specifically, we find θσ18/θσ10 (micelle) ≈ 1.4θσ18/θσ10 (vesicle). This result was already discussed in Fig. 1, but we see that the difference in composition is significant for all the coexisting micelle/vesicle systems. The fact that the micelles are relatively rich in (10, 18) and the vesicles are rich in (10, 10) might have been expected from rather general considerations.36
From Soup: 95 Above, we have extensively discussed the possibility that micelles and vesicles can coexist. At this stage we must realize that we have limited our analysis thus far to vesicles with a size of approximately R ≈ 100. There is nothing special about this particular size and, indeed, we can repeat the complete analysis for another vesicle size. It will not be a surprise that we obtained very similar result for this. Here we stress the word similar, because important differences are found too, with major consequences. From our experiments 12 we know that the vesicle size appears to be a strong function of the ratio (and concentration) PB 18 /PB 10 in the system. Although a full analysis of why there is a strong reduction of the vesicle size is involved, we propose the following argument. From Fig. 3d we know that it is possible to arrive at a situation that the concentration of micelles in the system is relatively high. In this regime it is reasonable to assume that the chemical potentials are determined by the micellar species rather than the vesicles . We therefore decided to search for vesicles with a fixed set of chemical potentials (bulk concentrations) of the two polymers . Indeed, for each vesicle size R we can find the requested match of bulk volume fractions (not exactly, but at a very high accuracy). It appears, however, that all these vesicles have a systematically different polymer composition. In Fig. 5 we plot the radius of the vesicle R as a function of the copolymer ratio in the vesicle , θ σ 18 / θ σ 10 , where we explicitly implemented the constraints that φ b 10 = 0.00010330 and φ b 18 = 0.00010901. As such Fig. 5 is thus only a result with a ‘proof of principle’ status, because we could have chosen any other set of bulk volume fractions to illustrate our arguments.
 ###### 
From cou.: 96 Above we have seen that upon an increase of the fraction (10, 18) in the system the grand potential of the micelles that coexist with vesicles decreases. At the same time the chemical potential (bulk volume fraction) of (10, 18) increases. On the other hand, the chemical potential of the (10, 10) copolymer decreases (slightly). At this stage it is not trivial to ascertain whether the size of the micelle, in terms of the total amount of copolymers (g = θσ18/N18 + θσ10/N10), is an increasing function of the (10, 18) concentration or not. As can be seen in Fig. 4 the model predicts that the overall molecular weight of the micelle increases with increasing ratio θσ18/θσ10, and hence the overall micelle aggregation number increases with increasing overall micelle concentration (cfFig. 3d). Again, this result is in line with the experimental data,12 albeit that in the experiments the increase in micellar mass is somewhat more pronounced. The reason for this is discussed below.
From Soup: 96 Inspection of Fig. 5 shows that with decreasing radius, the vesicles become slightly richer in the (10, 18) species. As in these graphs the chemical potentials of both surfactants are fixed, we also find that the grand potential of the vesicles is (virtually) constant. Hence, the free energy density is not altered while the composition shifts slightly as a response to an applied curvature. The result of Fig. 5 now suggests that upon an increase in the amount of the (10, 18) polymer in the system, the system can choose to keep the chemical potentials unaltered, and to populate the vesicles with (slightly) more (10, 18) copolymers . As evident from Fig. 5 , these vesicles have a smaller radius R . Hence, we conclude that once the chemical potentials are buffered by means of a strong dominance of small mixed micelles, the vesicle radii are a decreasing function of the amount of (10, 18) in the system. From Fig. 5 we notice that the dependence of R on the θ σ 18 / θ σ 10 is extremely strong and therefore we conclude that, in line with the experimental data , there is a very strong size selection of the vesicles . Inspection of Fig. 5 shows that the vesicle size levels off at an R ≈ 40. It is reasonable to take a value of b ≈ 0.5 nm as the characteristic size of a lattice layer. On this basis our results predict that the size of the vesicles can reduce to approximately R ≈ 20 nm (which is only reached at very high overall polymer concentrations). In any case, the predictions are in very good agreement with the observation that in the experimental system the vesicle size is as small as 30 nm. 12
 ###### 
From cou.: 97 From the experiments we further know that the width of the micelle size distribution is somewhat larger for lower polymer concentrations. We may understand this from our results as well. For a lower overall polymer concentration the micelle concentration is lower and the composition of the coexisting micelles shifts to a lower loading with (10, 18). From Fig. 1 we know that micelles rich in (10, 10) have a higher degree of polydispersity than micelles rich in (10, 18).
From Soup: 97 The robust size selection in these systems also suggests that the vesicle size distribution must be narrow. Experimentally it was shown that the vesicle size distribution becomes more narrow with increasing overall polymer concentration. 12 This is in full agreement with the prerequisite of the present argument, i.e. , that the concentration of micelles must be large (so that the micelles buffer the chemical potentials) to have an effective size selection and thus a narrow size distribution. Reducing the polymer concentration reduces the micelle concentration, and then the size selection is expected to be less effective and the vesicle size distribution should become broader. This is also found experimentally. 12
 ###### 
From cou.: 98 Above, we have extensively discussed the possibility that micelles and vesicles can coexist. At this stage we must realize that we have limited our analysis thus far to vesicles with a size of approximately R ≈ 100. There is nothing special about this particular size and, indeed, we can repeat the complete analysis for another vesicle size. It will not be a surprise that we obtained very similar result for this. Here we stress the word similar, because important differences are found too, with major consequences. From our experiments12 we know that the vesicle size appears to be a strong function of the ratio (and concentration) PB18/PB10 in the system. Although a full analysis of why there is a strong reduction of the vesicle size is involved, we propose the following argument. From Fig. 3d we know that it is possible to arrive at a situation that the concentration of micelles in the system is relatively high. In this regime it is reasonable to assume that the chemical potentials are determined by the micellar species rather than the vesicles. We therefore decided to search for vesicles with a fixed set of chemical potentials (bulk concentrations) of the two polymers. Indeed, for each vesicle size R we can find the requested match of bulk volume fractions (not exactly, but at a very high accuracy). It appears, however, that all these vesicles have a systematically different polymer composition. In Fig. 5 we plot the radius of the vesicle R as a function of the copolymer ratio in the vesicle, θσ18/θσ10, where we explicitly implemented the constraints that φb10 = 0.00010330 and φb18 = 0.00010901. As such Fig. 5 is thus only a result with a ‘proof of principle’ status, because we could have chosen any other set of bulk volume fractions to illustrate our arguments.
From Soup: 98 Up to this point we have focused on assemblies with spherical geometry, namely spherical vesicles and corresponding micelles. In the introduction we already pointed out that one of the complicating issues of the present type of SCF theories is that one needs to consider all possible geometries before one can decide what the most probable aggregate type is. We also discussed that by mixing the (10, 10) and (10, 18) copolymers , one can end up with an effective copolymer (10, 〈 m 〉) where 10 < 〈 m 〉 < 18. In such a situation we can expect that the worm-like micelles become the dominant species in the system at some intermediate copolymer mixing ratios. At this stage we need to estimate where this occurs in the current system. The simplest way to obtain this information is to consider the association into long linear micelles using the one-gradient cylindrical coordinate system. The ansatz that we use is the following: we have seen in Fig. 3a which sets of copolymer bulk volume fractions for both the (10, 10) as well as the (10, 18) copolymers are consistent with mixed vesicles . We use these sets of bulk concentrations once again in the cylindrical coordinate system. In Fig. 6 we present the grand potential of the worm-like micelles (per unit length) as a function of the ratio θ σ 18 / θ σ 10 in the worm like micelles, where we have explicitly imposed these matching bulk volume fractions (with the vesicles ). The circles indicated in Fig. 6 correspond to the same points used in Fig. 3 and 4 , which indicates that, in addition, the coexistence with mixed spherical micelles is possible.
 ###### 
From cou.: 99 Inspection of Fig. 5 shows that with decreasing radius, the vesicles become slightly richer in the (10, 18) species. As in these graphs the chemical potentials of both surfactants are fixed, we also find that the grand potential of the vesicles is (virtually) constant. Hence, the free energy density is not altered while the composition shifts slightly as a response to an applied curvature. The result of Fig. 5 now suggests that upon an increase in the amount of the (10, 18) polymer in the system, the system can choose to keep the chemical potentials unaltered, and to populate the vesicles with (slightly) more (10, 18) copolymers. As evident from Fig. 5, these vesicles have a smaller radius R. Hence, we conclude that once the chemical potentials are buffered by means of a strong dominance of small mixed micelles, the vesicle radii are a decreasing function of the amount of (10, 18) in the system. From Fig. 5 we notice that the dependence of R on the θσ18/θσ10 is extremely strong and therefore we conclude that, in line with the experimental data, there is a very strong size selection of the vesicles. Inspection of Fig. 5 shows that the vesicle size levels off at an R ≈ 40. It is reasonable to take a value of b ≈ 0.5 nm as the characteristic size of a lattice layer. On this basis our results predict that the size of the vesicles can reduce to approximately R ≈ 20 nm (which is only reached at very high overall polymer concentrations). In any case, the predictions are in very good agreement with the observation that in the experimental system the vesicle size is as small as 30 nm.12
From Soup: 99 In Fig. 6 we can see that the linear micelles that are rich in PB 10 PE 18 have a negative grand potential, whereas the ones that have relatively low levels of PB 10 PE 18 have positive values of this grand potential. Physically, one can interpret the grand potential per unit length as the lateral tension in the worm-like micelles. A positive value means that it is unfavorable to have long worms and such worms should shrink and transform into spherical micelles. On the other hand, a negative grand potential per unit length implies that it is favorable to have worms. Hence the system likes to make linear micelles as long as possible. The imposed chemical potentials are in the latter regime higher than necessary for the worm like micelles, and we conclude that linear micelles should dominate at high polymer concentrations (and are in fact not coexisting with vesicles , but only with mixed spherical micelles). Only in the case that the system is not too concentrated in PB 10 PE 18 , can we confirm, now with even more confidence, that coexistence of spherical vesicles and spherical micelles is the thermodynamic stable state (first two points in Fig. 3 , 4 and 6 ).
 ###### 
From cou.: 100 The robust size selection in these systems also suggests that the vesicle size distribution must be narrow. Experimentally it was shown that the vesicle size distribution becomes more narrow with increasing overall polymer concentration.12 This is in full agreement with the prerequisite of the present argument, i.e., that the concentration of micelles must be large (so that the micelles buffer the chemical potentials) to have an effective size selection and thus a narrow size distribution. Reducing the polymer concentration reduces the micelle concentration, and then the size selection is expected to be less effective and the vesicle size distribution should become broader. This is also found experimentally.12
From Soup: 100 Returning to Fig. 5 we must point to the fact that the aggregation numbers reported in this figure are underestimates, except for the aggregation numbers with the lowest θ σ 18 / θ σ 10 values. By the same token we must return to Fig. 3 and mention that upon the increase of micelle concentration ( Fig. 3d ) the transition from spherical to worm-like micelles takes place for θ σ 18 / θ σ 10 > 0.4. These worm-like micelles, however, do coexist only in a very narrow concentration regime with the vesicles . Indeed, the fact that both vesicles as well as linear micelles consist of a large number of polymers , the vesicle -to-linear micelle transition assumes close to first-order characteristics.

From cou.: 101 Up to this point we have focused on assemblies with spherical geometry, namely spherical vesicles and corresponding micelles. In the introduction we already pointed out that one of the complicating issues of the present type of SCF theories is that one needs to consider all possible geometries before one can decide what the most probable aggregate type is. We also discussed that by mixing the (10, 10) and (10, 18) copolymers, one can end up with an effective copolymer (10, 〈m〉) where 10 < 〈m〉 < 18.

From Soup: 101 The diagram of states presented in Fig. 3a,c now needs to be modified, because in this figure we overestimated the region where micelle– vesicle coexistence is possible. The improved phase boundaries are presented in Fig. 6 by the vertical lines. With increasing PB 10 PE 18 concentration it is expected that the PB 10 PE 10 lamellar phase first transforms into unilamellar vesicles (letter V in Fig. 6 ). Then, with the appearance of many small mixed micelles in the system the vesicle size decreases dramatically and these vesicles are under thermodynamic control. This region is indicated in Fig. 6 by the letters V + M. Above a given micelle concentration, the spherical micelles give way to worm-like micelles (second vertical line in Fig. 6 labeled by V + C + M indicates that at this point vesicles , cylindrical micelles and spherical micelles coexist). At higher PB 10 PE 18 concentrations the coexistence of micelles with vesicles disappears very quickly. Instead we will have a coexistence of spherical micelles with worm like micelles only, as indicated in Fig. 6 by the letters C + M. Further increase of PB 10 PE 18 will transform the linear micelles back into spherical micelles when the amount of PB 10 PE 10 is the minority component in the system (not indicated in Fig. 6 ).

From cou.: 102 In Fig. 6 we can see that the linear micelles that are rich in PB10PE18 have a negative grand potential, whereas the ones that have relatively low levels of PB10PE18 have positive values of this grand potential.

From Soup: 102 In the present model the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance (which depends on temperature) can be tuned by the Flory–Huggins parameter χ SO . A more negative value implies a lower temperature and a less negative value implies a higher temperature of the system. With increasing temperature the system approaches the CPT. Another way to say the same thing, is that the packing parameter 28 increases with temperature. Hence, the tendency to form worm-like micelles increases with increasing temperature, and, consequently, the preponderance of spherical micelles decreases. On the basis of the current calculations we conjecture that with increasing temperature it should be possible to switch from a coexistence of spherical vesicles with spherical micelles to a coexistence of spherical vesicles with worm-like micelles. Evidence for such types of coexistence has been obtained by simulations. 10

From Soup: 103 The above results clearly point to a mechanism which facilitates the appearance of small vesicles with a narrow size distribution. The results leave little doubt that in these systems the vesicle formation is thermodynamically controlled. Both the mechanism by which the stabilization occurs, as well as the level of detail in which we are able to mimic the properties of the binary PB 10 PE 10 , PB 10 PE 18 mixtures are unique. We argued above that the results are not limited to the PB-PE block copolymer systems, but some of the properties of this system certainly contribute to the equilibration: 12

From cou.: 104 The diagram of states presented in Fig. 3a,c now needs to be modified, because in this figure we overestimated the region where micelle–vesicle coexistence is possible. The improved phase boundaries are presented in Fig. 6 by the vertical lines. With increasing PB10PE18 concentration it is expected that the PB10PE10 lamellar phase first transforms into unilamellar vesicles (letter V in Fig. 6).

Further increase of PB10PE18 will transform the linear micelles back into spherical micelles when the amount of PB10PE10 is the minority component in the system (not indicated in Fig. 6).
From Soup: 104 The polymers have a low degree of polymerization : Although the hydrophobicity of PB is higher than that of poly(propylene oxide), we still must expect that the solubility of the two copolymers in water is not extremely low. The prediction of the CMC is φ b ≈ 10 −4 . The corresponding concentration in mol/L is of the same order of magnitude. This is not extremely low and thus we may expect that equilibration between micelles and vesicles is possible through the transport of freely floating copolymers .

From Soup: 105 Both species have the same tail length: Both copolymers have the same hydrophobic length and this helps the full miscibility of the copolymer inside the aggregates. Especially when there is a tail length disparity one may find non-ideal mixing of the copolymer species and vesicles composed of such copolymers may develop a non-zero spontaneous curvature (the spontaneous curvature is discussed below as well). The present system does not suffer from such a problem.

We argued above that the results are not limited to the PB-PE block copolymer systems, but some of the properties of this system certainly contribute to the equilibration:12
From Soup: 106 Micelles help equilibration: When vesicles coexist with a large number of small micelles, we must anticipate a rapid equilibration of the polymers throughout the system. The small micelles diffuse very rapidly and when they are near a much larger vesicle , the exchange of polymers must be relatively efficient. We cannot imagine that in systems with many small dynamic micelles, vesicles that have not equilibrated their size can persist. Equilibration through the presence of monomeric species is of course also possible.
 ###### 
From cou.: 107 The polymers have a low degree of polymerization: Although the hydrophobicity of PB is higher than that of poly(propylene oxide), we still must expect that the solubility of the two copolymers in water is not extremely low. The prediction of the CMC is φb ≈ 10−4. The corresponding concentration in mol/L is of the same order of magnitude. This is not extremely low and thus we may expect that equilibration between micelles and vesicles is possible through the transport of freely floating copolymers.
From Soup: 107 It is important to realize that the unilamellar mixed vesicles must coexist with mixed micelles and that it is impossible to remove the micelles while keeping the vesicles intact. This must be contrasted to classical first-order phase transitions, e.g. in a gas–liquid two-phase state. In this case it is possible to remove one phase while keeping the chemical potentials fixed and keep the other phase in the system. The vesicle to micelle transition is only a first-order like transition and strictly speaking the chemical potentials change slightly when by addition of micelle forming copolymers the vesicles are gradually transformed into micelles. The translational entropy of the micelles and the vesicles cause this subtle effect.

The present system does not suffer from such a problem.
From Soup: 108 Our SCF model predicts that the overall bending energy stored in the vesicles is of order 20 k B T . This is still a relatively high value and we expect that translational entropy alone cannot entirely compensate for the bending energy. As argued above we must anticipate that shape fluctuations also contribute to the entropy that is ignored in the SCF analysis. In any case, it seems likely that the vesicles are thermodynamically stable, implying that the ignored entropy ( translation and undulation) compensates for the curvature energy. Direct application of eqn (8) leads to very low volume fractions of vesicles , but a renormalization of the curvature energy (implementing the undulations) may help to increase the vesicle concentration to the levels seen in experiments. 37,38

From Soup: 109 In the literature it is generally expected that the mean bending modulus of a ( lipid ) bilayer is reduced when (micelle-forming) surfactants are added. 38 In fact, this is implemented in procedures where surfactants ( e.g. , Triton) are used to disrupt lipid bilayers in an attempt to harvest membrane proteins . 39 Bilayers with a low value for the bending modulus will also have a low value of the membrane persistence length ξ as ξ ∝ exp k c / k B T . 37 The membrane is expected to remain flat on length scales smaller than ξ , but it can bend away in arbitrary directions on larger length scales. It was argued therefore that thermodynamically stable vesicles should have a radius R ∝ ξ . 38 If we apply this argument to the present system, the dramatic reduction of the vesicle size R with increasing amount of PB 18 copolymers would suggest a significant reduction of the bending modulus. This appears incompatible with the current SCF predictions. Within the SCF model we can compute the bending modulus of mixed bilayers accurately 15 and we found (results not shown) that the bending modulus is a very weakly increasing function of the amount of PB 18 -blocks in the vesicles . The Gaussian bending modulus is negative and decreases slightly more, so that the overall curvature energy decreases. From previous calculations we learned that the bending modulus mostly depends on the length of the hydrophobic part of the copolymer and it is remarkably insensitive to the length of the corona block. 23 This trend was interpreted by the cancellation of compensating effects. A longer corona block leads to a reduction of the dimension of the core. Hence the increase of the bending modulus through the increasing dimension of the corona is compensated by the reduction of the bending modulus due to the reduction of the core size. We thus conclude that we cannot explain the size reduction of the vesicles by a decrease of the bending modulus of the bilayer upon the increase of PB 18 copolymers .

From Soup: 110 We realize that the proposed mechanism of having thermodynamically stable mixed vesicles coexisting with a high concentration of mixed micelles is non-classical. Intuitively, one could argue that the uneven distribution of the two amphiphiles between the inner and outer leaflet of the vesicle results in a non-zero spontaneous curvature. Again, using the method of Oversteegen et al. , 15 while computing the bending moduli discussed above, we found J 0 = 0 in all our systems, even though the inner and outer layers have slightly different polymer compositions. Indeed, a non-zero J 0 is only expected for systems wherein the two amphiphiles have a solubility gap. In this case the inner leaflet can be strongly enriched by the amphiphile with a small head group and the outer leaflet by the amphiphile with a larger head group . For a given composition the demixing is optimal for a well-defined vesicle radius corresponding to the spontaneous curvature. Obviously, this situation does not occur in the present system and thus the simple argument that an uneven distribution induces a non-zero J 0 does not apply.

From Soup: 111 In true first-order phase transition the coexistence between two phases is limited to a fixed value of the chemical potentials of the molecules involved. For micelles that are composed of a limited number of copolymers and having a concentration-dependent entropic contribution, the transition is only first-order like. Hence, the coexistence of spherical vesicles with spherical micelles, as elaborated above, occurs in a narrow window in chemical potentials. Unlike in true first-order transitions, the two species that coexist are subject to compostional and size changes while the system is pushed through the transition window. The model further suggests that the type of coexistence may be a strong function of the temperature. It is of considerable interest to find experimental support for the latter prediction.

From Soup: 112 Small unilamellar vesicles that are thermodynamically stable may find many applications. For example, small vesicles R < 100 nm have a much longer blood circulation time than larger vesicles . 40, 41 For this type of applications it is also relevant that the corona of the vesicle bilayer has a stealth property, 42 in the sense that the immune system does not notice small particles that have a poly(ethylene oxide) brush on is surface. Most likely this is due to the fact that proteins do not penetrate this PE layer. One can argue that the vesicles of the PB-PE system are less suitable for drug delivery vehicles because its constituents are relatively soluble in water (CMC is finite). Hence, upon dilution the bulk concentration may fall below the CMC (even though the CMC is a decreasing function of temperature) and the aggregates must fall apart. However, the presence of the large concentration of micelles in these systems may protect the disintegration of the vesicles to some extent. It is expected further that the micelles will dissolve first (and replenish the PB-PE bulk concentration to remain near the CMC) before the vesicles disintegrate. This is because the (10, 18) chains are more soluble than the (10, 10) ones, and the micelles are rich in the (10, 18) species.

From Soup: 113 A detailed self-consistent field theory is used to study the self-assembly characteristics of binary polymer mixtures in a selective solvent . We mimic the binary mixture of the lamellae forming copolymer PB 10 PE 10 mixed with the micelle forming PB 10 PE 18 species. 12 It is possible to choose a mixing ratio where small unilamellar vesicles coexist with many spherical micelles. We argued that the vesicle size can be tuned by the copolymer mixing ratio. For still modest PE 18 /PE 10 ratios, one enters a regime where the micelles are the dominant species, and these micelles buffer the chemical potential of the copolymers in the system. In such a situation one can store more PE 18 chains in smaller vesicles than in larger ones. Hence upon an increase of the amount of PE 18 in the system, the vesicles evolve towards small sizes. The predictions are in line with SANS and cryo-TEM data. 12 In addition, the SCF model explains many other salient properties of these systems. Hence, the SCF analysis gives strong support for the expectation that in binary polymer mixtures it is possible to have thermodynamically stable small unilamellar vesicles .

We argued that the vesicle size can be tuned by the copolymer mixing ratio. For still modest PE18/PE10 ratios, one enters a regime where the micelles are the dominant species, and these micelles buffer the chemical potential of the copolymers in the system. In such a situation one can store more PE18 chains in smaller vesicles than in larger ones. Hence upon an increase of the amount of PE18 in the system, the vesicles evolve towards small sizes. The predictions are in line with SANS and cryo-TEM data.12 In addition, the SCF model explains many other salient properties of these systems. Hence, the SCF analysis gives strong support for the expectation that in binary polymer mixtures it is possible to have thermodynamically stable small unilamellar vesicles.
