From cou.: 1 A μ-phenoxo-bis(μ2-1,3-acetato)-bridged dicopper(II) complex [CuII2(L1)(μ-O2CMe)2][NO3] (1) has been synthesized from the perspective of modeling phosphodiesterase activity. Structural characterization was done initially with 1·3Et2O (vapour diffusion of Et2O into MeOH solution of 1; poor crystal quality) and finally with its perchlorate salt [CuII2(L1)(μ-O2CMe)2][ClO4]·1.375MeCN·0.25H2O, crystallized from vapour diffusion of n-pentane into a MeCN–MeOH mixture (comparatively better crystal quality). An asymmetric unit of such a crystal contains two independent molecules of compositions [CuII2(L1)(μ-O2CMe)2][ClO4] and [CuII2(L1)(μ-O2CMe)2(MeCN)][ClO4] (coordinated MeCN with 0.75 occupancy), and two molecules of MeCN and H2O (each H2O molecule with 0.25 occupancy) as the solvent of crystallization. These two cations, each having five-coordinate (μ-phenoxo)bis(μ-acetato)-bridged CuII ions, differ by only the coordination environment of only one CuII ion, which has a weakly coordinated acetonitrile molecule in its sixth position. Temperature-dependent magnetic studies on 1 reveal that the copper(II) centres are antiferromagnetically coupled with the exchange-coupling constant J = −124(1) cm−1. Theoretically calculated J = −126.51 cm−1, employing a broken-symmetry DFT approach, is in excellent agreement with the experimental value. The dicopper(II) complex has been found to be catalytically efficient in the hydrolysis of 2-hydroxypropyl-p-nitrophenylphosphate (HPNP). Detailed kinetic experiments and solution studies (potentiometry, species distribution and ESI-MS) were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism. DFT calculations were performed to discriminate between different possible mechanistic pathways. The free-energy barrier for HPNP hydrolysis catalyzed by 1 is comparable to that obtained from the experimentally-determined value. The involvement of non-covalent (hydrogen-bonding) interaction has also been probed by DFT calculations. The activity of 1 is found to be the highest, compared to the structurally-characterized MnII2, CoII2, NiII2 and ZnII2 complexes of L1(−) reported earlier, under identical experimental conditions, in which each metal centre is six-coordinate.

From cou.: 2 In nature various biochemical processes involve hydrolysis of several biologically significant substrates like phosphate esters or peptides and the corresponding enzymes are often activated by more than one metal ion through cooperative action.1–4 Phosphodiesterases are of prime interest as the phosphate ester bonds are significantly inert toward hydrolytic cleavage.5,6 In order to understand the factors controlling phosphatase activity, the development and investigation of bio-inspired model complexes towards hydrolysis of an RNA-model substrate, 2-hydroxypropyl-p-nitrophenylphosphate (HPNP), have attracted great interest from a mechanistic viewpoint.7–13 For a molecular-level understanding further studies are still very relevant. The metal ions play an important role for hydrolytic cleavage in the following ways:7 (i) electrophilic activation of the substrate in the ground-state or stabilization of the transition-state by metal ion coordination, hydrogen-bonding or proton-transfer, (ii) generation of metal-coordinated hydroxide to act as a nucleophile, generated at close to neutral pH by Lewis-acid activation of metal-coordinated water via proton-abstraction by a base, (iii) nucleophilic attack on the substrate by metal-coordinated hydroxide, (iv) stabilization of a leaving group by metal-coordination, hydrogen-bonding or proton-transfer and (v) releasing the product(s)/leaving group(s) at a reasonable rate. Thus the choice of metal ions is one of the vital features for any synthetic mimic to achieve improved hydrolytic activity.

From cou.: 3 In this work, we have chosen copper(II) ions because of the following reasons: (i) they have high Lewis acidity and can activate coordinated water molecule effectively to generate a metal-coordinated hydroxide and are also capable of bringing about efficient activation of the substrate in the transition-state, (ii) owing to its d9 electronic configuration copper(II) has flexible geometry so that it can adjust to the changes in the bond-length and geometry during the course of the hydrolysis reaction, (iii) after the reaction, the release of the product is expected to be facile because of the Jahn–Teller effect. This stimulated us to focus on developing a dicopper(II) complex of L1(−) (Fig. 1) and the outcome of such an effort is the successful synthesis of 1. We report here the structural properties of [CuII2(L1)(μ-O2CMe)2][ClO4]·1.375MeCN·0.25H2O. The spectroscopic properties, magnetic properties and catalytic potential of 1 towards hydrolysis/transesterification of HPNP are presented. Many theoretical calculations have been performed to propose the most suitable reaction pathway for the hydrolysis of HPNP.12 Recently, specific base and concerted catalysis has been proposed for an alkoxo-based dizinc(II) complex.12b On the other hand, Brown and co-workers12c proposed general base catalysis. Thus further studies are needed to establish an appropriate rate-determining step (RDS) for the HPNP transesterification reaction.

From cou.: 4 Herein, we compare the activity of 1 with the previously reported [MII2(L1)(μ-O2CMe)2(MeCN)2][PF6] (M = Mn, Co, Ni, Zn) complexes with the same ligand13 and the observed trend in activity has been rationalized. This comparative study with change in the metal ion, keeping the ligand invariant, will underpin the role of metal ions for developing a better synthetic hydrolase model. Quantum-chemical studies at the DFT-level have been performed to pinpoint the nature of catalytically-active species, the nature of the transition-states and the RDS involved in the reaction pathway.

From cou.: 19 Considering the pH-dependent equilibrium between p-nitrophenol (PNPh) and p-nitrophenolate (PNPate), the increase of the concentration of the reaction product can be calculated (pH = pKS + log[PNPate]/[PNPh]) by using the pKS value of 7.15.10b The kinetic studies were performed in MeOH–H2O (33%, v/v). The solution was buffered using N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (HEPES) (20 mM, pH range: 6.8 to 8) or [2-(N-cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid] (CHES) (20 mM, pH range: 8.6 to 9.5) or 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) (20 mM, for pH 6.5) and the ionic-strength was maintained at I = 0.1 M with NaNO3. Experiments to determine the dependence of the reaction rate on the complex concentration were carried out at 30 °C, pH 8.50, [HPNP] = 5 × 10−5 M, [complex] = 30 × 10−5 to 75 × 10−5 M. In order to evaluate the thermodynamic parameters, the rate of the reaction was investigated in the range 30–45 °C at pH 8.50 with a 10-fold excess of complex (50 × 10−5 M), compared to substrate (5 × 10−5 M) concentration. The effect of acetate ion concentration on the reaction rate at 30 °C was evaluated at pH 8.50 with a 10-fold substrate excess (4.62 × 10−4 M) relative to the complex (4.62 × 10−5 M). For all the kinetic experiments, the complex solution was mixed with a buffer solution in a thermostated cuvette and was left for 10 min for temperature equilibration, prior to addition of the substrate. All kinetic experiments were run twice and average values were taken. In all these experiments, the spontaneous hydrolysis was corrected by direct difference between two identical parallel reactions, but without the addition of catalyst in one of them. Kinetic data analysis for phosphatase-like activity of the title complex was also done following the Michaelis–Menten treatment; [complex] = 4.62 × 10−5 M; [buffer] = 20 × 10−3 M (CHES, pH = 8.50); I = 0.1 M (NaNO3) in MeOH–H2O (33%, v/v) at 30 °C with varying HPNP concentrations.13 The data were plotted and treated with the initial-rate method. Initial-rates were determined from the slope of the tangent to the p-nitrophenolate concentration vs. time curve at t = 0. The total amount of p-nitrophenol/p-nitrophenolate was determined by using the pKa value of 7.15.10b The kinetic studies were performed under conditions as described above. To study the solvent deuterium isotope effect, kinetic experiments were performed following the same procedure as described above but in deuterated solvents. pD = pHmeasured + 0.413 was applied11f to the pH meter-readings for reaction in deuterated solvents. However, it should be mentioned here that in deuterated solvents the solubility of buffer and ionic salt was poor, which resulted in very scattered data points. Given this situation, we admit that the accuracy-level of this experiment is not up to our full satisfaction. However, the kH/kD ratio presented here is a reasonable estimate.

The IR spectra of the complex displayed characteristic absorptions due to the stretching vibrations of coordinated acetate32a at 1591 and 1443 cm−1. Peaks are also observed due to uncoordinated NO3− at 1384 and 815 cm−1. Elemental analysis, IR and solution electrical conductivity data (1:1 electrolyte in MeCN; expected range for 1:1 electrolytes: 120–160 Ω−1 cm2 mol−1)32b are in good agreement with the above formulation.

The reaction of HL1 with Et3N, CuII(NO3)2·3H2O, MeCO2Na·3H2O and NaClO4·H2O in MeOH afforded the isolation of a green complex, which upon crystallization from vapour diffusion of n-pentane into the MeCN–MeOH mixture afforded crystals of composition [CuII2(L1)(μ-O2CMe)2][ClO4]·1.375MeCN·0.25H2O. The perchlorate salt is closely similar to that of the nitrate salt.

Also the electronic spectral feature for both the complexes are very much similar with d–d transition at ∼690 nm and the phenolate to Cu(II) charge transfer at ∼410 nm.

From cou.: 22 The quality of crystals for [CuII2(L1)(μ-O2CMe)2][NO3]·3Et2O (1·3Et2O) was not of good quality. A perspective view of the cationic part of 1·3Et2O is displayed in Fig. S1 (ESI‡). The structural analysis of a better quality of crystal with perchlorate as a counteranion [CuII2(L1)(μ-O2CMe)2][ClO4]·1.375MeCN·0.25H2O is discussed here. The asymmetric unit of such a crystal contains two independent molecules of compositions [CuII2(L1)(μ-O2CMe)2][ClO4] and [CuII2(L1)(μ-O2CMe)2(MeCN)][ClO4] (coordinated MeCN has 0.75 occupancy), and two molecules of MeCN and H2O as the solvent of crystallization. Each H2O molecule assumes 0.25 occupancy. The perspective views of the metal coordination environment of these two dimeric units are displayed in Fig. 2. Selected bond lengths and bond angles are listed in Table 2. In [CuII2(L1)(μ-O2CMe)2][ClO4], two CuII centres are held together by a bridging phenolate oxygen (Cu1–O1–Cu2 = 112.41(10)°) from the endogenous ligand and two exogenous acetate ions coordinated in the μ2-1,3-bridging mode. Each of the CuII centres is five-coordinate, assuming square-pyramidal geometry as judged by the τ value33 (τ = 0.141 for Cu1 and 0.084 for Cu2; for ideal square-pyramidal geometry τ = 0 and for ideal trigonal-bipyramidal geometry τ = 1). Both the CuII centres are terminally coordinated by two nitrogens from each arm of the ligand (a pyridine and a pyrazole of the 3-(2-pyridyl)pyrazole unit). The basal-plane for Cu1 consists of pyridyl N1, pyrazolyl N2, bridging phenoxide O1 and the bridging acetate O2. The apical position of the square-pyramid is occupied by O4 of the other bridging acetate ion (Cu1–O4 bond-length: 2.150(2) Å), thus completing the N2O3 coordination sphere for Cu1. For the Cu2 centre, the pyridyl N6, pyrazolyl N5, bridging phenoxide O1 and the bridging acetate ion O5 form the basal-plane. The other bridging acetate ion O3 is in the axial position (Cu2–O3 = 2.166(2)) of the square-pyramid. Notably, each acetate ion coordinates equatorially to one of the CuII centres and axially to the other. Thus each acetate ion is coordinated to two CuII ions asymmetrically (Table 2). Both the CuII centres are axially elongated owing to their d9 configuration. Compared to pyridyl nitrogens N1 and N6, the pyrazolyl nitrogens N2 and N5 bind strongly to the CuII centres (Table 2). The average CuII–Npyrz (pyrz = pyrazole) bond distance of 1.975 Å is shorter than the average CuII–Npy (py = pyridine) bond distance of 2.055 Å. A similar trend has been observed before.13 In [CuII2(L1)(μ-O2CMe)2(MeCN)][ClO4], the structural features are similar to that described for [CuII2(L1)(μ-O2CMe)2][ClO4]. The two cations differ only by the coordination environment of one of the CuII ions (Cu3–N15 = 2.610 Å), which has a weakly coordinated acetonitrile molecule in its sixth position.

The d–d transition associated with CuII centres is observed at 690 nm (ε = 216 M−1 cm−1) which justifies its square-pyramidal geometry. Strong absorption at 290 nm (ε = 20000 M−1 cm−1) is due to metal-perturbed intraligand transition (Fig. S2, ESI‡). The spectral feature observed here is consistent with phenoxo-acetato-bridged dicopper systems reported in the literature.34

From Soup: 41 The BS-state ( M s = 0) is found to be more stable compared to its high-spin state ( M s = 1) and thus antiferromagnetic interaction is expected. BS-DFT calculation performed on 1 revealed that the copper( II ) centres have the opposite spin with the same magnitude ( Fig. 4(a) ): +0.61 for Cu1, −0.61 for Cu2. Opposite spins with a similar magnitude on two copper( II ) centres indicate the existence of antiferromagnetic-exchange interaction. In fact, by following eqn (4) the magnetic-exchange coupling constant ( J ) is calculated as −126.51 cm −1 . This computed J value is in excellent agreement with the experimental J value of −124 cm −1 .

From Soup: 42 To understand the exchange-pathway, we look at the change in spin-density in going from the high-spin (HS) state to the broken-symmetry (BS) state. Table S1, ESI ‡ describes the spin-density values of Cu ions, coordinating atoms of the ligand and the carboxylate carbon atom which connects the two oxygen atoms. Compared to the HS-state, the spin-density of the Cu2 centre in the BS-state is the opposite in sign with almost similar magnitude. On the other hand, the spin-density of the Cu1 centre remains constant in both the HS- and the BS-states. Importantly, the bridging phenolate oxygen atom has a spin-density of magnitude 0.126 in the HS-state, which is found to be reduced to a value of 0.002 in the BS-state. This indicates that the phenolate bridge is involved in the overlapping of two Cu II centres. It is relevant to mention here that one of the oxygen atoms O5 of a carboxylate bridge has some spin-density (0.117), which is inverted (−0.115) in the BS-state. But there is insignificant spin-density at the connecting carbon atom C25 and other oxygen atom O4 of the same carboxylate-bridge. Thus the extended overlap throughout the carboxylate-bridge is not possible. This in turn results in very insignificant contribution of the carboxylate-bridge towards the super-exchange mechanism. This feature can also be understood in more detail from the projection of the magnetic-orbitals ( Fig. 4(b) ), involved in the exchange pathway. The metal part of orbitals is antibonding with respect to the ligand part of the orbitals. A close inspection of these magnetic-orbitals reveals that both the Cu II centres interact through the p orbital of the bridging phenolate oxygen. Though one of the oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group is capable of overlapping with one of the Cu II centres, however, the lack of participation of the p orbitals from the connecting C atom and other O atom of the same carboxylate group makes the carboxylate group a poor mediator for the antiferromagnetic exchange-interaction. Thus, for the present case there is only one possible exchange-pathway which is mediated by the oxygen atom of the phenolate bridge. This type of observation is also observed for alkoxo- acetate-bridged dinuclear Cu II systems. 36
 ###### 
From cou.: 43 The BS-state (Ms = 0) is found to be more stable compared to its high-spin state (Ms = 1) and thus antiferromagnetic interaction is expected. BS-DFT calculation performed on 1 revealed that the copper(II) centres have the opposite spin with the same magnitude (Fig. 4(a)): +0.61 for Cu1, −0.61 for Cu2. Opposite spins with a similar magnitude on two copper(II) centres indicate the existence of antiferromagnetic-exchange interaction. In fact, by following eqn (4) the magnetic-exchange coupling constant (J) is calculated as −126.51 cm−1. This computed J value is in excellent agreement with the experimental J value of −124 cm−1.
From Soup: 43 We demonstrated earlier 13 that for bis-μ 2 -1,3-acetato-bridged-dimetal( II ) (Mn, Co, Ni, Zn) complexes supported by L 1 (−), the acetate ions do not remain coordinated to the metal centres in aqueous–MeOH (33%, v/v). As a consequence, in such a media the labile sites are occupied by solvent molecules. In order to identify the catalytically-active species for phosphatase-activity (see the Phosphate ester hydrolysis section) potentiometric titration was carried out for 1 . The p K a values of coordinated water molecules were determined in MeOH–H 2 O (33%, v/v) because of the low-solubility of the complex in pure water. A typical curve obtained for the titration is shown in Fig. S3, ESI. ‡ For one equiv. of Cu II 2 complex two equiv. of NaOH was consumed in the pH range of 6–11, indicating two deprotonation equilibria as shown in Scheme 1 . The p K a values of the coordinated water molecules were calculated to be 6.29 ± 0.04 and 6.93 ± 0.03. The distribution curve is displayed in Fig. S4, ESI. ‡

From cou.: 44 To understand the exchange-pathway, we look at the change in spin-density in going from the high-spin (HS) state to the broken-symmetry (BS) state. Table S1, ESI‡ describes the spin-density values of Cu ions, coordinating atoms of the ligand and the carboxylate carbon atom which connects the two oxygen atoms. Compared to the HS-state, the spin-density of the Cu2 centre in the BS-state is the opposite in sign with almost similar magnitude. On the other hand, the spin-density of the Cu1 centre remains constant in both the HS- and the BS-states. Importantly, the bridging phenolate oxygen atom has a spin-density of magnitude 0.126 in the HS-state, which is found to be reduced to a value of 0.002 in the BS-state. This indicates that the phenolate bridge is involved in the overlapping of two CuII centres. It is relevant to mention here that one of the oxygen atoms O5 of a carboxylate bridge has some spin-density (0.117), which is inverted (−0.115) in the BS-state. But there is insignificant spin-density at the connecting carbon atom C25 and other oxygen atom O4 of the same carboxylate-bridge. Thus the extended overlap throughout the carboxylate-bridge is not possible. This in turn results in very insignificant contribution of the carboxylate-bridge towards the super-exchange mechanism. This feature can also be understood in more detail from the projection of the magnetic-orbitals (Fig. 4(b)), involved in the exchange pathway. The metal part of orbitals is antibonding with respect to the ligand part of the orbitals. A close inspection of these magnetic-orbitals reveals that both the CuII centres interact through the p orbital of the bridging phenolate oxygen. Though one of the oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group is capable of overlapping with one of the CuII centres, however, the lack of participation of the p orbitals from the connecting C atom and other O atom of the same carboxylate group makes the carboxylate group a poor mediator for the antiferromagnetic exchange-interaction. Thus, for the present case there is only one possible exchange-pathway which is mediated by the oxygen atom of the phenolate bridge. This type of observation is also observed for alkoxo- acetate-bridged dinuclear CuII systems.36
From Soup: 44 To identify the species present in solution for 1 at pH 8.5 in MeOH–H 2 O (33%, v/v), ESI-MS experiments were done. The ESI-MS spectra (Fig. S5, ESI ‡ ) revealed a prominent peak at 637.03, corresponding to [Cu II 2 (L 1 )(HCO 2 ) 2 ] + . Other two peaks at 627.0 and 618.97 are attributed to the species [Cu II 2 (L 1 )(HCO 2 )(OH)(H 2 O)] + and {[Cu II 2 (L 1 )(H 2 O) 4 ] 3+ + 2e − } + , respectively. The formate ions present in the ESI-MS column get coordinated to the Cu II centres. These experimental findings, supported by simulated spectra (Fig. S6, ESI ‡ ), point to the fact that the acetate ions are prone to be dissociated, under the experimental conditions. Given this observation and the information extracted from the species distribution plot (Fig. S4, ESI ‡ ), it is revealed that up to pH 6.3, the major species in solution is “Cu II (H 2 O)Cu II (H 2 O)”. From pH 6.3 to 7.00 the prominent species in solution is “Cu II (OH)Cu II (H 2 O)”. Above pH 7.00, the species “Cu II (OH)Cu II (OH)” predominates. Thus, the two p K a values observed for 1 are associated with the conversion of “Cu II (H 2 O)Cu II (H 2 O)” to “Cu II (OH)Cu II (H 2 O)” (p K a1 ) and “Cu II (OH)Cu II (H 2 O)” to “Cu II (OH)Cu II (OH)” (p K a2 ) ( Scheme 1 ).

From Soup: 45 The ability of the dicopper( II ) complex 1 to catalyse the hydrolysis/transesterification of HPNP was carried out following the protocol reported earlier. 13 The hydrolysis of HPNP was monitored by a time-dependent 31 P NMR spectral study. 31 P NMR spectra obtained under conditions of excess substrate at various time-intervals are displayed in Fig. S7, ESI. ‡ The chemical shift of HPNP is at −5 ppm. As the hydrolysis reaction proceeds, the formation of the cyclic phosphodiester is observed at 17.98 ppm ( Scheme 2 ). At longer times ( t = 28 h) almost all the substrates are hydrolyzed to the cyclic phosphodiester.

From cou.: 46 To identify the species present in solution for 1 at pH 8.5 in MeOH–H2O (33%, v/v), ESI-MS experiments were done. The ESI-MS spectra (Fig. S5, ESI‡) revealed a prominent peak at 637.03, corresponding to [CuII2(L1)(HCO2)2]+. Other two peaks at 627.0 and 618.97 are attributed to the species [CuII2(L1)(HCO2)(OH)(H2O)]+ and {[CuII2(L1)(H2O)4]3+ + 2e−}+, respectively. The formate ions present in the ESI-MS column get coordinated to the CuII centres.

Thus, the two pKa values observed for 1 are associated with the conversion of “CuII(H2O)CuII(H2O)” to “CuII(OH)CuII(H2O)” (pKa1) and “CuII(OH)CuII(H2O)” to “CuII(OH)CuII(OH)” (pKa2) (Scheme 1).
From Soup: 46 Kinetic experiments have been carried out by monitoring spectrophotometrically the absorption increase of the liberated p -nitrophenolate anion [ λ max = 400 nm with ε = 18 500 M −1 cm −1 , considering equilibration p -nitrophenol/ p -nitrophenolate (p K a = 7.15)] 10b under pseudo-first-order conditions (excess complex concentration at 30 °C). 13 The time-course of the change in the absorbance for the hydrolysis of HPNP by 1 at different concentrations is displayed in Fig. S8, ESI. ‡ Raw-data are displayed in Fig. S9, ESI. ‡ Notably, the hydrolysis of HPNP by 1 is strongly influenced by pH. Rate-constant ( k obs ) vs. pH plot ( Fig. 5 ) shows that the value increases with increasing pH and it shows significant activity above pH 7. At very high pH (above 8.5), the catalyst decomposition starts (colloidal suspension is observed) and catalytic activity decreases. The k obs vs. pH plot shows a sigmoidal nature and sigmoidal-fitting reveals a kinetic p K a of 6.82, which is very close to the p K a2 value of 6.93, determined from potentiometric titration. This observation suggests that the active species is generated after the second deprotonation. Thus the catalytically-active species is “Cu II (OH)Cu II (OH)”. Also the species-distribution plot (Fig. S4, ESI ‡ ) shows that above pH 7, the “Cu II (OH)Cu II (OH)” species predominates in solution.

From Soup: 47 It is worth-mentioning here that possible deprotonation from MeOH to produce OMe − - coordinated species like “Cu II (OMe)Cu II (OMe)” is discarded, due to the fact that in the ESI-MS spectral analysis, under our experimental conditions, no MeOH/OMe − -coordinated species were observed (see ESI-MS data in the potentiometry section). Moreover, the computational studies (see the Computational studies section) reveal a higher free-energy barrier for OMe − -coordinated species “Cu II (OMe)Cu II (OMe)”, compared to the free-energy barrier observed for “Cu II (OH)Cu II (OH)” (see the Computational studies section). Since our experimental conditions include MeOH–H 2 O (33%, v/v), the amount of H 2 O is more compared to MeOH, therefore it is reasonable to assume that H 2 O/OH − -coordinated species will predominate over MeOH/OMe − -coordinated species.

Rate-constant (kobs) vs. pH plot (Fig. 5) shows that the value increases with increasing pH and it shows significant activity above pH 7. At very high pH (above 8.5), the catalyst decomposition starts (colloidal suspension is observed) and catalytic activity decreases.

From Soup: 48 Kinetic data (Fig. S10, ESI ‡ ) reveal that the observed rate-constant ( k obs ) of hydrolysis is linearly dependent on the concentration of 1 . The apparent second-order rate constant ( k 2 , M −1 s −1 ) was calculated from the slope of the straight-line of the k obs vs. [complex] plot. The corresponding values for Mn II 2 , Co II 2 , Ni II 2 and Zn II 2 complexes 13 are given in Table 3 . The observed trend is as follows Cu II 2 ∼ Zn II 2 > Co II 2 > Mn II 2 > Ni II 2 . No significant hydrolysis of the model substrate occurred, when the metal complex was absent. The p K a values 13 of M II -coordinated water for all complexes are also included in Table 3 . The Cu II 2 and Zn II 2 complexes, being most Lewis acidic, not only generate the active species “M II (OH)M II (OH)” readily but also activate the substrate more efficiently, compared to Mn II 2 , Co II 2 and Ni II 2 complexes. Since the binding of ligands to Ni II centres is directional and restricted, the p K a values of coordinated water molecules for the Ni II 2 complex are high, amongst the chosen set of complexes. Hence the Ni II 2 complex exhibits poor reactivity. The Cu II 2 and Zn II 2 complexes have similar p K a values and thereby exhibit similar k 2 values ( Table 3 ). Notably, the observed k 2 values for Mn II 2 , Co II 2 , Cu II 2 and Zn II 2 complexes linearly correlate with the Z eff / r values 37 of the metal-ion ( Fig. 6 ).

Analysis of the ESI-MS (Fig. S11, ESI ‡ ) shows the presence of HPNP-coordinated species at m / z = 868.07, with the composition [Cu II 2 (L 1 )(HCO 2 )(HPNP)] + . This observation indicates that the hydrolysis of HPNP proceeds through a catalyst–substrate adduct formation (like the enzyme–substrate complex formation in enzyme catalysis) which eventually activates the P–O bond for the nucleophilic attack. Two additional peaks at m / z 637.03 and 729.04 are observed, which corresponds to the species [Cu II 2 (L 1 )(HCO 2 ) 2 ] + and [Cu II 2 (L 1 )(HCO 2 )(Cyp)] + (Cyp is the cyclic phosphate generated during the hydrolysis of HPNP), respectively.

Since the binding of ligands to NiII centres is directional and restricted, the pKa values of coordinated water molecules for the NiII2 complex are high, amongst the chosen set of complexes. Hence the NiII2 complex exhibits poor reactivity. The CuII2 and ZnII2 complexes have similar pKa values and thereby exhibit similar k2 values (Table 3). Notably, the observed k2 values for MnII2, CoII2, CuII2 and ZnII2 complexes linearly correlate with the Zeff/r values37 of the metal-ion (Fig. 6).
From Soup: 50 Kinetic experiments were also carried out according to the Michaelis–Menten method (excess substrate concentration at pH 8.5 and 30 °C, under saturation kinetics conditions) 13 to investigate further the effect of substrate (HPNP) concentration on hydrolysis reaction, catalyzed by 1 . Kinetic data analysis shows saturation behaviour (Fig. S13, ESI ‡ ) with increasing substrate concentration, suggesting the formation of a complex–substrate intermediate in the course of the reaction. The Lineweaver–Burk (reciprocal of Michaelis–Menten equation) plot is shown in Fig. 7 . Kinetic parameters obtained from this plot are presented in Table 4 . Similar values are obtained, when kinetic parameters are derived from the saturation plot following the Michaelis–Menten equation directly (Fig. S13, ESI ‡ ).

From cou.: 51 In order to identify the species generated in the course of the reaction between HPNP and 1, the ESI-MS experiment was carried out with excess substrate concentration (complex/HPNP: 1/30) at pH 8.5 in MeOH–H2O (33%, v/v).

Simulated spectra are displayed in Fig. S12, ESI.‡
From Soup: 51 The Michaelis–Menten constant K M of 1 is 2.46 ± 0.17 mM, which is the highest compared to complexes Mn II 2 , Co II 2 , Ni II 2 and Zn II 2 , indicating less binding affinity ( K ass = 405.8 ± 28 M −1 ). Consequently, 1 exhibits highest catalytic activity with the catalytic rate-constant k cat = 14.50 ± 0.36 × 10 −4 s −1 in the chosen set of complexes. The Cu II and Zn II ions being most Lewis acidic are expected to activate HPNP in a better manner than other metal-ions and hence these complexes exhibit higher catalytic activity. When Cu II 2 and Zn II 2 complexes are compared, the former complex is found to be more efficient than the latter. Increased Lewis acidity may have an opposing effect to the hydrolytic activity because the hydroxide ion will then be strongly bound to the metal centre; thereby its nucleophilicity/basicity would get decreased. Also the release of products from the metal centre will also be less facile for highly Lewis acidic metal ions. Notably, this phenomenon becomes particularly relevant when the substrate is present in excess. So, for maximum reactivity there should be an adjustment between the Lewis acidity and lability of the metal ion. Owing to its d 9 configuration, the copper( II ) ion is axially distorted (Jahn–Teller effect). Probably this increased distortion in geometry for copper( II ) provides the adjustment between the binding affinity and release of the product(s) in the course of the reaction, and consequently, results in exhibiting higher catalytic activity for 1 . Similar types of observations were encountered with heterometallic Fe III M II series (M II = Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Hg, Cd) where the Fe III Cu II system is the most efficient towards phosphatase-activity with 2,4-bis(dinitrophenyl)phosphate (BDNPP) as a model substrate. 38 The catalytic rate-constant ( k cat = 14.5 × 10 −4 s −1 ) exhibited by 1 for the hydrolysis/transesterification of HPNP is comparable to other dicopper( II ) complexes ( k cat = 5.68 × 10 −4 –28 × 10 −4 s −1 ) reported earlier, 11a,b,12e and it is ∼6500 times ( k cat / k uncat ) that of the uncatalyzed reaction. It is appropriate to mention here that nature prefers zinc( II ) over other metal( II ) ions for catalyzing many hydrolytic reactions. 1–3 The result of this work calls for comparative calculations and the outcome of such an endeavour will be the subject matter of a future publication.

From Soup: 52 In order to evaluate whether or not the acetate ions have any effect on the rate of hydrolysis of HPNP catalyzed by 1 , the hydrolysis reaction was monitored as a function of acetate concentration. The plot of percentage of inhibition with the number of acetate equiv. added is displayed in Fig. S14, ESI. ‡ With increasing acetate ion concentration the rate of hydrolysis decreases as found earlier. 13 With the addition of 20 equiv. of the acetate ion, 54% inhibition is observed. In the presence of excess acetate, the dissociation of acetate ions from metal centers become less facile and thus the generation of active hydroxo-coordinated species is hindered and the substrate HPNP cannot approach the metal centres effectively. This causes decreased activity, when acetate ions are added externally. The rate-inhibition by acetate ions indicates that the dissociation of acetate ions from metal centres in the starting complex is necessary in order to exhibit the catalytic activity. 13

From Soup: 54 Since for the chosen set of complexes, the ligand framework is invariant, the thermodynamic parameters are expected to be comparable, thereby implying a similar course of reaction. However, from the point of view of the reaction mechanism the sign of Δ S ‡ is informative. Negative Δ S ‡ values suggest the organization of reactive species in the transition-state. This indicates that the transesterification of HPNP catalyzed by 1 as well as Mn II 2 , Co II 2 , Ni II 2 and Zn II 2 proceeds through a transition-state involving a pre-equilibrium interaction/adduct formation between the catalysts and HPNP. Data obtained from Michaelis–Menten kinetics support the same. Therefore, the thermodynamic parameters obtained from a temperature-dependent study reveals that the essential steps in the HPNP hydrolysis by the chosen set of complexes are as follows: first, the activation of HPNP by the catalyst through binding to the metal centre(s) and then the intramolecular nucleophilic attack on the electrophilic phosphorus atom with the release of the leaving group.

From cou.: 55 In addition to kinetic parameters, thermodynamic parameters also provide crucial information to understand any reaction mechanism. To evaluate thermodynamic parameters, kinetic experiments were performed as a function of temperature. The activation energies and parameters Ea, ΔH‡, ΔS‡ and ΔG‡ (Table 5) were obtained through the Arrhenius and the Eyring equations.

From Soup: 55 Understandably, the solvent deuterium isotope effect study is an important feature from the mechanistic point of view. When k H / k D is less than 1.5, a nucleophilic mechanism is expected, whereas when it is greater than 2, the reaction proceeds via a general-base mechanism. 11e,f For 1 , k H / k D was observed as ∼3.0. This experiment justifies that the metal-coordinated hydroxide ion is acting as a general-base catalyst to deprotonate the hydroxyl group of HPNP during hydrolysis. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the hydrolysis of HPNP catalyzed by 1 , along with the speciation study led us to propose a classical double Lewis acid activation mechanism. The k obs vs. pH plot ( Fig. 5 ) reveals the sigmoidal profile with the kinetic p K a of 6.85 and maximum catalytic activity in the range 7.5–8.5. The species-distribution plot (Fig. S4, ESI ‡ ) shows that in the pH range 7.5–8.5, the predominant species is “Cu II (OH)Cu II (OH)”. Thus, the deprotonation of two metal-coordinated water molecules is necessary to generate the catalytically-active species “Cu II (OH)Cu II (OH)”. The substrate is activated by coordination to the Cu II centres, supported by the negative entropy change and Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The direct coordination of HPNP to the metal centres and hydrogen-bonding interactions (see the Computational studies section) activate the P–O bond for nucleophilic attack ( Scheme 3 ).

From cou.: 56 Since for the chosen set of complexes, the ligand framework is invariant, the thermodynamic parameters are expected to be comparable, thereby implying a similar course of reaction. However, from the point of view of the reaction mechanism the sign of ΔS‡ is informative. Negative ΔS‡ values suggest the organization of reactive species in the transition-state. This indicates that the transesterification of HPNP catalyzed by 1 as well as MnII2, CoII2, NiII2 and ZnII2 proceeds through a transition-state involving a pre-equilibrium interaction/adduct formation between the catalysts and HPNP. Data obtained from Michaelis–Menten kinetics support the same. Therefore, the thermodynamic parameters obtained from a temperature-dependent study reveals that the essential steps in the HPNP hydrolysis by the chosen set of complexes are as follows: first, the activation of HPNP by the catalyst through binding to the metal centre(s) and then the intramolecular nucleophilic attack on the electrophilic phosphorus atom with the release of the leaving group.
From Soup: 56 Recently theoretical studies employing DFT calculations have been used to elucidate the mechanism of hydrolysis/transesterification of HPNP. 12 To throw light on the nature and structure of the active-catalyst, and the intermediate as well as transition-state from the perspective of the reaction mechanism, detailed DFT calculations have been performed (Tables S2–S16, ESI ‡ ). All energies reported in this section are Gibbs free-energy. At first, attention was paid to explicate the structure of the active catalyst. For this purpose several probable structures were optimized ( Fig. 8 ). This leads to the fact that the most probable structure of the active-catalyst is [Cu II 2 (L 1 )(μ-OH)(OH)] + ( I A ). In I A , one of the OH − ions is bridged between the metal centres, whereas the other one is terminally coordinated. In this structure, one Cu II centre is five-coordinate and the other one is four-coordinate. I A is stabilized by −4.25 kcal mol −1 compared to I B , where both the OH − ions are terminally coordinated to each of the metal centres ( Fig. 8 ). Compared to I A aq and I B aq , I A is stabilized by −4.35 kcal mol −1 and −3.42 kcal mol −1 , respectively. It should be noted that the energy of I A aq was compared with ( I A + H 2 O) and for I B aq it was compared with ( I A + 2H 2 O). The transition-state energy barrier for the species with one bridging hydroxo and one terminal hydroxo (corresponding to TS A ) was found to be less compared to the species where both the hydroxo groups are terminally coordinated (corresponding to TS B ). Therefore, the reaction-profile starting with I A is discussed here ( Fig. 9 ; S16, ESI ‡ ) and the reaction pathways starting with the abovementioned I B , I A aq and I B aq are discussed in Fig. S17–S20, ESI. ‡ Coordination of HPNP to I A leads to the formation of [Cu II 2 (L 1 )(μ-OH)(OH)(HPNP)] II A ( Fig. 9 ), and the relative free-energy change is −6.38 kcal mol −1 . Both the copper( II ) centres are five-coordinate in the catalyst–substrate adduct II A and HPNP binds in a monodentate fashion to the apical position of Cu2 with a Cu2–O5 distance of 2.204 Å. Owing to the d 9 configuration, copper( II ) centres are axially elongated. For Cu2 the axial position is occupied by the O5 of HPNP and for Cu1 the pyrazolyl nitrogen provides the axial coordination with Cu1–N2 = 2.236 Å. The non-coordinated O1 of HPNP is stabilized by strong hydrogen-bonding with the bridging hydroxo group (O1⋯H23 = 2.047 Å). The relative free-energy change starting from I B to II B (Fig. S18, ESI ‡ ), where both the hydroxo groups are terminally coordinated is −7.10 kcal mol −1 . In the transition-state TS A ( Fig. 9 and S16, ESI ‡ ), it is found that the concurrent proton-transfer from O10 to O2 (as evident from O10–H28 = 1.00 Å and O2⋯H28 = 1.654 Å in II A vs. O10⋯H28 = 1.506 Å and O2–H28 = 1.033 Å in TS A ) triggers the nucleophilic attack of O10 on the P1 atom of HPNP. This leads to the shortening of the P1–O10 distance and lengthening of the P1–O7 distance in TS A , compared with II A (as evident from P1–O10 = 4.207 Å and P1–O7 = 1.677 Å in II A vs. P1–O10 = 2.281 Å and P1–O7 = 1.768 Å in TS A ).

From cou.: 57 Understandably, the solvent deuterium isotope effect study is an important feature from the mechanistic point of view. When kH/kD is less than 1.5, a nucleophilic mechanism is expected, whereas when it is greater than 2, the reaction proceeds via a general-base mechanism.11e,f For 1, kH/kD was observed as ∼3.0. This experiment justifies that the metal-coordinated hydroxide ion is acting as a general-base catalyst to deprotonate the hydroxyl group of HPNP during hydrolysis. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the hydrolysis of HPNP catalyzed by 1, along with the speciation study led us to propose a classical double Lewis acid activation mechanism. The kobsvs. pH plot (Fig. 5) reveals the sigmoidal profile with the kinetic pKa of 6.85 and maximum catalytic activity in the range 7.5–8.5. The species-distribution plot (Fig. S4, ESI‡) shows that in the pH range 7.5–8.5, the predominant species is “CuII(OH)CuII(OH)”. Thus, the deprotonation of two metal-coordinated water molecules is necessary to generate the catalytically-active species “CuII(OH)CuII(OH)”. The substrate is activated by coordination to the CuII centres, supported by the negative entropy change and Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The direct coordination of HPNP to the metal centres and hydrogen-bonding interactions (see the Computational studies section) activate the P–O bond for nucleophilic attack (Scheme 3).
From Soup: 57 Concomitant with the proton-transfer, there is a significant increase in the Cu1–O2 distance (1.946 Å in II A vs. 2.244 Å in TS A ) and similar decrease in the Cu2–O5 distance (2.204 Å in II A vs. 2.025 Å in TS A ). Because of this proton-transfer from the hydroxyl group of HPNP, the metal-coordinated hydroxo (O2) group becomes water and hence becomes loosely-coordinated to the Cu1 centre. As a consequence, the O5 oxygen of HPNP gets tightly bound to the Cu2 centre, which in turn increases the electrophilicity of the phosphorus atom P1. This increase in electrophilicity of the phosphorus atom is further assisted by a very strong hydrogen-bond between the non-coordinated O1 of HPNP and the bridging hydroxo group (O1⋯H23 = 1.844 Å). This is further reflected in the increase in the Mulliken charge-density from 1.832 in II A to 1.954 in TS A . The nucleophilic attack of O10 on the P1 atom is also fostered by the increased hydrogen-bonding interaction between the O10 and methylene proton H6 of the ligand L 1 (−): O10⋯H6 = 2.264 Å in TS A vs. 2.788 in II A . This sort of additional non-covalent interaction-assisted transition-state is quite common in biology but rare in small molecule model systems. Relative to II A , the energy-barrier is calculated to be 11.16 (4.78 + 6.38) kcal mol −1 . A similar situation occurs for TS B (Fig. S17, ESI ‡ ) and the energy-barrier is 12.75 (5.65 + 7.10) (for TS B ) kcal mol −1 , relative to II B . Next, the nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom by O10 leads to the liberation of p -nitrophenolate ions (PNPs) and formation of the cyclic phosphate, which is coordinated to the Cu2 centre with Cu2–O5 = 2.165 Å in III A ( Fig. 9 ). It is interesting to note that the Cu2–O5 distance was 2.025 Å in TS A and after the nucleophilic attack it increases to 2.165 Å in III A . The increase in bond-length facilitates the displacement of the cyclic phosphate by another molecule of the substrate (HPNP) so that the reaction proceeds to the second catalytic cycle. This adjustment of bond-length in the course of reactions is facilitated by the copper( II ) ion, owing to its d 9 configuration, which is responsible for its axial elongation. Since the cyclic phosphate resides over the axial position, its replacement becomes facile by additional substrate coordination. Relative to II A , this reaction is exergonic by 13.48 (−6.38 + 19.86) kcal mol −1 ( Fig. 10 ).

From cou.: 58 Recently theoretical studies employing DFT calculations have been used to elucidate the mechanism of hydrolysis/transesterification of HPNP.12 To throw light on the nature and structure of the active-catalyst, and the intermediate as well as transition-state from the perspective of the reaction mechanism, detailed DFT calculations have been performed (Tables S2–S16, ESI‡). All energies reported in this section are Gibbs free-energy. At first, attention was paid to explicate the structure of the active catalyst. For this purpose several probable structures were optimized (Fig. 8). This leads to the fact that the most probable structure of the active-catalyst is [CuII2(L1)(μ-OH)(OH)]+ (IA). In IA, one of the OH− ions is bridged between the metal centres, whereas the other one is terminally coordinated. In this structure, one CuII centre is five-coordinate and the other one is four-coordinate. IA is stabilized by −4.25 kcal mol−1 compared to IB, where both the OH− ions are terminally coordinated to each of the metal centres (Fig. 8). Compared to IAaq and IBaq, IA is stabilized by −4.35 kcal mol−1 and −3.42 kcal mol−1, respectively. It should be noted that the energy of IAaq was compared with (IA + H2O) and for IBaq it was compared with (IA + 2H2O). The transition-state energy barrier for the species with one bridging hydroxo and one terminal hydroxo (corresponding to TSA) was found to be less compared to the species where both the hydroxo groups are terminally coordinated (corresponding to TSB). Therefore, the reaction-profile starting with IA is discussed here (Fig. 9; S16, ESI‡) and the reaction pathways starting with the abovementioned IB, IAaq and IBaq are discussed in Fig. S17–S20, ESI.‡ Coordination of HPNP to IA leads to the formation of [CuII2(L1)(μ-OH)(OH)(HPNP)] IIA (Fig. 9), and the relative free-energy change is −6.38 kcal mol−1. Both the copper(II) centres are five-coordinate in the catalyst–substrate adduct IIA and HPNP binds in a monodentate fashion to the apical position of Cu2 with a Cu2–O5 distance of 2.204 Å. Owing to the d9 configuration, copper(II) centres are axially elongated. For Cu2 the axial position is occupied by the O5 of HPNP and for Cu1 the pyrazolyl nitrogen provides the axial coordination with Cu1–N2 = 2.236 Å. The non-coordinated O1 of HPNP is stabilized by strong hydrogen-bonding with the bridging hydroxo group (O1⋯H23 = 2.047 Å). The relative free-energy change starting from IB to IIB (Fig. S18, ESI‡), where both the hydroxo groups are terminally coordinated is −7.10 kcal mol−1. In the transition-state TSA (Fig. 9 and S16, ESI‡), it is found that the concurrent proton-transfer from O10 to O2 (as evident from O10–H28 = 1.00 Å and O2⋯H28 = 1.654 Å in IIAvs. O10⋯H28 = 1.506 Å and O2–H28 = 1.033 Å in TSA) triggers the nucleophilic attack of O10 on the P1 atom of HPNP. This leads to the shortening of the P1–O10 distance and lengthening of the P1–O7 distance in TSA, compared with IIA (as evident from P1–O10 = 4.207 Å and P1–O7 = 1.677 Å in IIAvs. P1–O10 = 2.281 Å and P1–O7 = 1.768 Å in TSA).
From Soup: 58 Then to proceed to the next catalytic cycle, the coordinated cyclic phosphate must leave along with a proton during the approach of another equiv. of substrate i.e. HPNP, leading to the catalyst–substrate adduct of the second catalytic cycle. To model this step, a suitable approach was used, 12d,39 as the comprehensive study of these events are very difficult to model using the quantum-chemical methodology adopted here. The overall hydrolysis reaction of HPNP without any catalyst as described in Scheme 2 is calculated to be exergonic by 4.91 kcal mol −1 . Since the catalyst does not alter this energy, one full catalytic-cycle should be exergonic by the same amount. 12d,39 Thus the catalyst–substrate adduct II A′ of the second catalytic-cycle will be stabilized by 4.91 kcal mol −1 , compared to the catalyst–substrate adduct II A of the first catalytic-cycle. Thus II A′ will now have energy −11.29 {−6.38 + (−4.91)} kcal mol −1 . Now one can estimate the energy-difference in going from III A of the first cycle to II A′ of next cycle to be endergonic by 8.57 (−11.29 + 19.86) kcal mol −1 ( Fig. 10 ). The rate-determining free-energy barrier can be calculated as the difference between the free-energies of III A of one catalytic cycle and the transition-state TS A′ of the next catalytic cycle. This value is estimated as 19.73 (−0.13 + 19.86) kcal mol −1 , which is comparable with the experimentally determined value of 23.33 kcal mol −1 (see the temperature-dependent kinetics study section). The overall free-energy profile is described in Fig. 10 .

From Soup: 59 Another alternative mechanism was also investigated computationally. Here the metal-coordinated hydroxide ion was probed to act as a base to activate an external water molecule ( Fig. 11 ). As a result of this, the O atom of this external H 2 O molecule acts as a base to deprotonate the hydroxyl group of HPNP for the hydrolytic cleavage. The optimized transition-state is described in Fig. 11 . This optimized transition-state is 19.23 kcal mol −1 higher than that of II A + H 2 O. The energy-barrier for this transition-state is 8.07 kcal mol −1 higher compared to the earlier proposed mechanism, where the metal-coordinated hydroxide ion directly activates the hydroxyl group of HPNP for the hydrolytic activity ( Scheme 3 ).

From Soup: 60 Furthermore, an attempt was made to check the possibility whether OMe − -coordinated species “[Cu II 2 (L 1 )(μ-OMe)(OMe)] + ” decrease the transition-state energy barrier compared to their analogous hydroxo species [Cu II 2 (L 1 )(μ-OH)(OH)] + ( I A ). However, a computational study reveals the transition-state energy barrier of 15.10 kcal mol −1 (Fig. S21, ESI ‡ ) which is 3.94 kcal mol −1 higher than that observed starting from hydroxo-coordinated species. As the experimental conditions is more aqueous in nature (MeOH–H 2 O; 33% v/v), it is reasonable to assume that the hydroxo-coordinated species [Cu II 2 (L 1 )(μ-OH)(OH)] + will predominate over the methoxo-analogue as the catalytically-active species. The absence of any MeOH or OMe − -coordinated species in the ESI-MS spectra recorded under kinetic experimental conditions (Fig. S5 and S13, ESI ‡ ) supports this assumption.

The nucleophilic attack is facilitated by additional non-covalent interaction between the attacking O10 and methylene proton H6 of the ligand L 1 (−). A comparable free-energy barrier as computed by DFT calculation with an experimentally-determined activation-parameter led us to propose the most probable pathway is as described in Fig. 9 and 10 .

From Soup: 62 The present work describes the synthesis and characterization of a μ-phenoxo- and bis(μ 2 -acetato)-bridged dicopper( II ) complex 1 . Complex 1 has been tested as a model for phosphodiester hydrolysis of the RNA-model substrate, HPNP. The two copper( II ) centres are antiferromagnetically coupled. DFT calculations, employing BS-formalism, reveal that the antiferromagnetic-exchange coupling mainly occurs through the phenolate-bridge. The experimental exchange integral J (−124 cm −1 ) is nicely reproduced by the BS-DFT calculated value (−126.51 cm −1 ). In an attempt to pinpoint the effect of metal ions towards the hydrolysis/transesterification of HPNP, detailed kinetic studies were carried out, under pseudo-first-order conditions (excess complex concentration) as well as under excess substrate conditions (Michaelis–Menten kinetic analysis) and compared with the reported results. 13 Results obtained from these experiments reveal that the catalytic activity is largely dependent on the choice of the metal-ion and copper( II ) is found to be the best suited for high catalytic activity among the chosen set of metal( II ) ions (Mn, Co, Ni and Zn), under identical experimental conditions. The activity of 1 is on the higher-side of the range observed for other dicopper( II ) complexes reported in the literature. 11a,b,12e Potentiometric titration data combined with the kinetic data (rate vs. pH profile) reveals that catalytically-active species is generated after the second deprotonation. This led us to propose that the bis-hydroxo species [Cu II 2 (L 1 )(μ-OH)(OH)] + is the catalytically-active species. Computational studies reveal some interesting points about the reaction mechanism: (i) the substrate is found to be activated through binding to one of the copper( II ) centres and hydrogen-bonding between the non-coordinated O1 of HPNP and the bridging hydroxo group (O1⋯H23 = 2.047 Å) drives the catalyst–substrate adduct formation ( II A ), (ii) this kind of catalyst–substrate adduct formation is further substantiated by Michaelis–Menten behaviour in kinetics experiments, (iii) in the transition-state TS A , the concurrent proton-transfer from the hydroxyl group (O10) of HPNP to the Cu1-coordinated-hydroxo (O2) group triggers the nucleophilic attack of O10 on the P1 atom of HPNP, (iv) the nucleophilic attack is driven by the increased electrophilicity of P1 by relatively stronger binding (as compared to II A ) of the O5 oxygen of HPNP to the Cu2 centre, (v) additional hydrogen-bonding interaction between O10 and the methylene proton H6 of the ligand (O10⋯H6 = 2.263 Å in TS A vs. 2.788 in II A ) also facilitates the nucleophilic attack, (vi) after the transesterification step, the cyclic phosphate is loosely bound to the copper( II ) centre and thus is easily displaced by another HPNP molecule so that the reaction proceeds to the second catalytic-cycle, (vii) throughout the course of the reaction, the combination of increased Lewis acidity and axial elongation capability makes the copper( II ) ion suitable for activation of the substrate in the transition-state with stronger binding and release of the cyclic phosphate, after the completion of the reaction, (viii) the free-energy barrier calculated from the DFT calculation is comparable with the experimentally-determined value.
