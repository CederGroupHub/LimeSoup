From cou.: 1 A multi-leveled theoretical investigation combining TD-DFT (B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP) methods and a semi-empirical method was conducted to determine the structure-related spectral properties of T-series dendrimers composed of nearly hundreds of atoms, based on a proposed molecular model. Both one- and two-photon absorption spectra of the dendrimer molecules were well reproduced. The “antenna effect” in the dendrimers molecule was theoretically studied. The process of excitation energy localization from chromophores in the branches to the pyrene core before the fluorescence emission was visualized using contours of the charge different density (CDD) between the electronic states. Conclusions based on the theoretical model were drawn about the observed photophysical properties of T-series dendrimers as follows: (a) increasing the generation of a branch would enhance the absorption of photons with a wavelength below 430 nm; (b) enlarging the conjugation of branches would enhance the coupling among the chromophores and would lower the excitation energy; (c) the existence of inter-molecular coupling among the “antenna” chromophores in conjugated branches and the pyrene core would significantly promote two-photon absorption.

From cou.: 2 The dendritic structure is considered as one of the most promising structures to design two-photon absorption (2PA) materials with large 2PA cross-sections and highly efficient two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF).1–12 Two mainly unique features of the dendritic structure, called the “antenna effect” and the “shell effect”, guarantee its outstanding photophysical properties.8,9,13,14 To design and determine the structure-dependent 2PA properties of dendrimers, both theoretical and applied research efforts into dendrimers have been increasing in recent years. Great efforts have been taken to synthesize new dendrimers and to modify the existing ones.4–6,15–17 Theoretical investigations have also been carried out to explain the experimental results, and a number of factors have been found to affect the 2PA of dendrimers, such as electronic delocalization, degree of molecular planarity, and cooperative enhancement between chromophores.2,5–8,10,18–31 Thus, theoretical models for dendrimers should be built to quantitatively describe the structure-property relationship, and to effectively guide the design of dendrimers. Unfortunately, because many dendrimers that have been reported to have excellent 2PA properties contain hundreds of atoms,8,12,14,32–34 the large size of dendrimer molecules makes single-scale modeling with TD-DFT calculations not viable, and therefore exciton models or other models should be employed to divide the dendrimer molecule into several parts, so that a theoretical method for smaller molecules could be applicable for large dendrimers.35–42

From Soup: 26 In the present study, a two-scaled model was built to determine the optical properties for the T-series dendrimers. For a 2 nm scale molecular model of the basic chromophores, the molecular geometries at the ground and the excited states were optimized employing B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, and the corresponding TD-B3LYP, TD-CAM-B3LYP methods with a basis set of 6-31G(d,p). 23,49,50 The frequency analysis was also carried out at the corresponding level. The Huang-Rhys factors at each vibrational mode were also determined, with which the fluorescence and the absorption band of S 1 were simulated. Then, for the 10 nm scale model, the ground state geometries of molecules T1 to T4 were optimized using the PM6 method. The electronic excited states were computed by the ZINDO method with the corresponding ground state optimal conformations. The 1PA and 2PA spectra were calculated using the transition dipole moments obtained from the calculation results of the excited states. The excited-state properties of the molecules were also characterized and investigated with the three-dimensional cube representation of the charge difference density (CDD), 8,51–53 which showed the distribution of the net change in electron and hole densities as a result of the electronic transitions. The consistency of the ZINDO and TD-CAM-B3LYP methods were tested. All the computations were performed with the Gaussian 09 program package. 54

From Soup: 27 Core–shell structures are the basic structure feature of stiff T-series dendrimers ( T1 , T2 , T3 , and T4 , shown in Scheme 1 ). In all these dendrimers, pyrene is chosen as the dendrimer core, because of its excellent photoluminescence efficiency ( Φ F = 0.60 in cyclohexane), 55,56 while fluorenes are chosen as the major chromophores in branches, because of their capability of extending the conjugation structure, 56 and carbazoles are chosen as the terminal or the junction chromophores connecting the branches in the first and second generation, because the three, six, and nine positions could be easily modified. 57,58 Acetylene linkers are chosen as the π-conjugated connection structures of all the chromophores mentioned above. 59,60 Long alkyl groups do not contribute to the absorption and emission, but they are necessary spacers in dendrimers that prevent the aggregation and self-quenching of nearby chromophores. 7,61 In other words, the specific dendritic structure is expected to be one of the most remarkable structural motifs for the T-series dendrimers in this article, simultaneously having a large 2PA cross-section and a high TPEF quantum yield. 41,56,62 The optical properties of T-series dendrimers are determined by two main chromophores: the polycyclic aromatic pyrene core and the branch chromophores composed of conjugated fluorene and acetylene (phenylethynyl) linkages combined together. These are the basic structural foundations for the electronic properties.

From Soup: 28 As a macromolecule, the spatial distribution and the arrangement of chromophores in dendrimers significantly affect the optical properties. In T-series dendrimers, the number of chromophores is much greater than nine, and the distance between two chromophores does not exceed 10 nm. When the dendrimers is excited in a light field, the excitation energy transfer and the coupling between chromophores cannot be ignored. Moreover, the unique molecular geometry of T-series dendrimers promotes the coupling. In all these T-series dendrimers, the most obvious characteristic of the molecular geometry is the large conjugated planar system, which consists of pyrene, fluorene, benzene, and the rigid acetylene linkers, and has been reported to be able to increase the π-electron delocalization and enhance the coupling of chromophores among the branches. 31,38,41,63 Furthermore, both the increase of the π-electron delocalization and the enhancement of the coupling of chromophores have been reported to be able to enhance the 2PA cross-section. 31,38,41,63

From Soup: 29 In short, the size of T-series dendrimers has far exceeded the range that the precise DFT/TD-DFT methods could easily handle. Besides, the T-series dendrimers contain large conjugation sections, and the organization form of the chromophores is not randomly distributed, and thus it will inevitably affect the optical properties. Therefore, an overall consideration of multiple chromophores is of crucial importance. Fortunately, the PM6/ZINDO method should be a practical method for such macromolecule system; however, detailed information, such as the information about the molecular structures of the excited states and the vibrational modes, is not available. 64,65 Combining the advantage of both the DFT/TD-DFT and PM6/ZINDO methods, a multi-scaled theoretical investigation was carried out. At a 2 nm scale, based on DFT/TD-DFT calculations, fine molecular models were built for the element chromophores, while at a 10 nm scale, based on semi-empirical calculations, global models were built for the dendrimer molecules.

To build fine molecular models, the elemental chromophores should be carefully chosen. The chosen elemental chromophores should be able to significantly represent the basic photophysical properties of the global dendrimer. As a first step, in the molecular models, we divided the dendrimer into two parts, with key element chromophores in the branches (Chromophore B) and in the core (Chromophore C) of the T-series dendrimers (shown in Fig. 1 ).

From Soup: 31 Furthermore, to give full consideration of the conjugations and linkages among chromophores, not only the acetylene linkers but the benzene rings are also included in the models. The HOMOs and LUMOs of the chromophores contribute most to the transition from the ground state (S 0 ) to the lowest excited singlet state (S 1 ), which correspond to the absorption (shown in Fig. 1 ). The detailed descriptions of the transitions, including the molecular orbitals and the corresponding coefficients, are listed in the ESI † (Tables S5 and S6). The results of the different calculation methods are similar to the pattern shown in Fig. 1 . The HOMOs are π orbitals distributed on the carbazole or pyrene chromophore and the acetylene linkers, while the LUMOs are the corresponding π* orbitals. The vertical (Franck–Condon) and adiabatic (0–0) transition energies from the ground state to the low-lying singlet states are listed in Tables 1 and 2 . Among these, the adiabatic transitions are more relevant to the measured spectra. The excitation energies of the adiabatic transition obtained by CAM-B3LYP/TD-CAM-B3LYP is 3.28 eV for Chromophore B and 2.48 eV for Chromophore C, respectively. It was found that these results are very close to the experimental results. 8,66 For the semi-empirical method, the optimized structures of the excited states are not available. Therefore, the corresponding excitation energies for the adiabatic transition and the precise description of the absorption band are not yet available. However, the excitation energies obtained by PM6/ZINDO are 3.32 eV for Chromophore B and 2.59 eV for Chromophore C, which are also very close to the experimental results.

From Soup: 32 The orbitals and the excitation energies determine the positions of the absorption bands, while the charge distributions and their response to the optical field determine the intensity of the bands. Fig. 2 shows the calculated charge difference densities (CDD), which describe the change in charge distribution as a result of the S 0 –S 1 transition, as shown in ref. 8 and 51–53 . The electron and hole density contours shown in Fig. 2 agree well with the vacuum molecular orbitals shown in Fig. 1 . The molecular orbitals and the CDD contours indicate that in Chromophores B and C, the S 0 –S 1 transitions belong to a π–π* transition, and that the conjugation structures in Chromophores B and C are large enough to represent the photophysical properties of the element segment in the dendrimers. Moreover, from Fig. 2 , it was found that the calculated CDD contours and the transition dipole moments obtained by TD-CAM-B3LYP calculation agree well with that obtained by ZINDO calculations. It was also found that the CDD contour for the S 0 –S 1 transition of Chromophore C is very close to that of the T-series dendrimers (shown in Fig. 4a ). Furthermore, the CDD contour for the S 0 –S 1 transition of Chromophore B is also very close to those distributed in the branches of the T-series dendrimers. Taking into consideration the good agreement of the calculated and experimental excitation energies, the reliability of the chosen calculation method is confirmed. Moreover, the ZINDO and TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) methods were also proven to be consistent for the T-series dendrimers and for Chromophores B and C.

From Soup: 33 Based on the optimized structures and vibrational modes of Chromophores B and C, we simulated the absorption and fluorescence spectra (shown in Fig. 3 ). The vibrational modes and corresponding Huang-Rhys factors are listed in the ESI † (Tables S3 and S4). The shape of the S 0 –S 1 absorption band of Chromophore B is determined by the stretching mode at 1556.7 cm −1 , with a Huang-Rhys factor of 0.61769, which is similar with the reported results in the carbazole system. 67,68 The simulated S 0 –S 1 absorption band of Chromophore B is very close to the observed absorption bands of T1–T4 in the 330–430 nm region. 8,66 Moreover, the stretching mode of Chromophore C at 1714 cm −1 , with a Huang-Rhys factor of 0.27436, determines both the shape of the S 0 –S 1 absorption band and the fluorescence, which is close to the reported results on the pyrene chromophore. 69–73 The simulated S 0 –S 1 absorption band (in the 430–550 nm region) and the fluorescence spectrum of Chromophore C are identical with the experimental results of T1–T4 (see Fig. S9 and S10 in the ESI † ). 8,66 It is very likely that in T-series dendrimers, Chromophore B in the branches mainly determines the absorption in the 330–430 nm region, while a single Chromophore C in the core determines the absorption in the 430–550 nm region and the fluorescence.

From cou.: 34 The orbitals and the excitation energies determine the positions of the absorption bands, while the charge distributions and their response to the optical field determine the intensity of the bands. Fig. 2 shows the calculated charge difference densities (CDD), which describe the change in charge distribution as a result of the S0–S1 transition, as shown in ref. 8 and 51–53. The electron and hole density contours shown in Fig. 2 agree well with the vacuum molecular orbitals shown in Fig. 1.

Moreover, from Fig. 2, it was found that the calculated CDD contours and the transition dipole moments obtained by TD-CAM-B3LYP calculation agree well with that obtained by ZINDO calculations. It was also found that the CDD contour for the S0–S1 transition of Chromophore C is very close to that of the T-series dendrimers (shown in Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the CDD contour for the S0–S1 transition of Chromophore B is also very close to those distributed in the branches of the T-series dendrimers. Taking into consideration the good agreement of the calculated and experimental excitation energies, the reliability of the chosen calculation method is confirmed. Moreover, the ZINDO and TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) methods were also proven to be consistent for the T-series dendrimers and for Chromophores B and C.
From Soup: 34 The modeling of T1–T4 in the 10 nm scale was carried out to obtain an overall understanding of the inter-chromophore effects and energy transfers. Based on the models, the simulated data should agree with the experimentally detected results. As detailed information is not directly available by calculations employing the ZINDO method, the molecular models of elemental chromophores at the 2 nm scale were used as a solid supplement. As mentioned in the previous section, the fine molecular models of elemental chromophores (Chromophores B and C) were built, and the rationality of the models were then tested. As in the 2 nm scale, the consistency of the calculation results from the ZINDO method and the TD-DFT method were tested, as the consistency of the ZINDO calculations at the 2 nm and 10 nm scales is a crucial factor in solving the problem.

From cou.: 35 Based on the optimized structures and vibrational modes of Chromophores B and C, we simulated the absorption and fluorescence spectra (shown in Fig. 3). The vibrational modes and corresponding Huang-Rhys factors are listed in the ESI† (Tables S3 and S4). The shape of the S0–S1 absorption band of Chromophore B is determined by the stretching mode at 1556.7 cm−1, with a Huang-Rhys factor of 0.61769, which is similar with the reported results in the carbazole system.67,68 The simulated S0–S1 absorption band of Chromophore B is very close to the observed absorption bands of T1–T4 in the 330–430 nm region.8,66 Moreover, the stretching mode of Chromophore C at 1714 cm−1, with a Huang-Rhys factor of 0.27436, determines both the shape of the S0–S1 absorption band and the fluorescence, which is close to the reported results on the pyrene chromophore.69–73 The simulated S0–S1 absorption band (in the 430–550 nm region) and the fluorescence spectrum of Chromophore C are identical with the experimental results of T1–T4 (see Fig. S9 and S10 in the ESI†).8,66 It is very likely that in T-series dendrimers, Chromophore B in the branches mainly determines the absorption in the 330–430 nm region, while a single Chromophore C in the core determines the absorption in the 430–550 nm region and the fluorescence.
From Soup: 35 In the visible spectral region, with identical absorbance and similar band shapes, the absorption bands of T1–T4 are almost the same. According to the calculations, for all of these molecules, only the S 1 state is located in the region above 430 nm. As mentioned in the previous sections, the molecular structures of T1–T4 are unique at the core (Chromophore C).

From cou.: 36 The modeling of T1–T4 in the 10 nm scale was carried out to obtain an overall understanding of the inter-chromophore effects and energy transfers. Based on the models, the simulated data should agree with the experimentally detected results. As detailed information is not directly available by calculations employing the ZINDO method, the molecular models of elemental chromophores at the 2 nm scale were used as a solid supplement. As mentioned in the previous section, the fine molecular models of elemental chromophores (Chromophores B and C) were built, and the rationality of the models were then tested. As in the 2 nm scale, the consistency of the calculation results from the ZINDO method and the TD-DFT method were tested, as the consistency of the ZINDO calculations at the 2 nm and 10 nm scales is a crucial factor in solving the problem.
From Soup: 36 The CDD contours of the S 0 –S 1 transitions in the T-series molecules indicate that the S 1 states locate mainly in the center chromophores. These CDD contours of T1–T4 are identical not only with each other, but also with Chromophore C (see Fig. 2, 4 and Tables S3 and S4 in the ESI † ). The effect of coupling among these chromophores in the dendrimers on the optical properties could be quantitatively described in the variation of the transition dipole moments. For all the T-series dendrimers, i.e. from T1–T4 , the S 0 –S 1 transition corresponds to the π–π* transition of elections in the pyrene core. As these transitions take place in identical molecular structures, not only all the corresponding excitation energies are very close to 2.5 eV, but all the amplitude of the corresponding transition dipoles are also identical, with oscillator strengths of about ∼2.0, with negligible differences. Furthermore, the vibration mode and frequencies are unique for T1–T4 . These characteristics of the molecular structure are further affirmed by the identical fluorescence spectra of T1–T4 .
 ###### 
From cou.: 37 In the visible spectral region, with identical absorbance and similar band shapes, the absorption bands of T1–T4 are almost the same. According to the calculations, for all of these molecules, only the S1 state is located in the region above 430 nm. As mentioned in the previous sections, the molecular structures of T1–T4 are unique at the core (Chromophore C).
From Soup: 37 With excitation energies higher than 2.75 eV, the conjugated fluorene and acetylene in the branches would be excited. Different from the region above 430 nm, for the region from 330 nm to 430 nm, the absorption involves the excitation of several delocalized chromophores (shown in Fig. 4 and in Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI † ). As the dendrimer contains a large number of conjugated fluorenes and acetylenes, the couplings among them generate large transition dipole moments. The overall transition dipoles of these chromophores should therefore be taken into consideration to describe the S 0 –S x transition and the absorption. From the amplitudes of the transition dipoles and the oscillator strengths mentioned above, it is also found that the absorptions attributed to the branches is stronger than that attributed to the pyrene core. Besides the overall transition dipoles, the contribution of each chromophore is also marked in Fig. 4 .
 ###### 
From cou.: 38 The CDD contours of the S0–S1 transitions in the T-series molecules indicate that the S1 states locate mainly in the center chromophores. These CDD contours of T1–T4 are identical not only with each other, but also with Chromophore C (see Fig. 2, 4 and Tables S3 and S4 in the ESI†). The effect of coupling among these chromophores in the dendrimers on the optical properties could be quantitatively described in the variation of the transition dipole moments. For all the T-series dendrimers, i.e. from T1–T4, the S0–S1 transition corresponds to the π–π* transition of elections in the pyrene core.

Furthermore, the vibration mode and frequencies are unique for T1–T4. These characteristics of the molecular structure are further affirmed by the identical fluorescence spectra of T1–T4.
From Soup: 38 As shown in Fig. 4b , the orientation of the Chromophore C center and the overall molecule do not completely overlap, and there is an angle of about 20° between the overall transition dipole and the minor axis of Chromophore C. Comparing the absorption band of T1 and T3 in this region, it is found that the shifting of the absorption peaks is insignificant, because the types of chromophores and the conjugation extent of the chromophores in T1 and T3 are similar. Moreover, as T3 has one more generation of branches than T1 , it contains three times the chromophores, and the absorption intensity of T3 is thus much (about three times) stronger than T1 . Comparing the CDD contours of T1 and T3 (shown in Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI † ), it is found that high energy photons (wavelengths shorter than 400 nm) are mainly absorbed by chromophores from the outer branches, and therefore one more generation of branch in the dendrimer should greatly enhance the absorption below 400 nm in the spectra.
 ###### 
From cou.: 39 With excitation energies higher than 2.75 eV, the conjugated fluorene and acetylene in the branches would be excited. Different from the region above 430 nm, for the region from 330 nm to 430 nm, the absorption involves the excitation of several delocalized chromophores (shown in Fig. 4 and in Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI†). As the dendrimer contains a large number of conjugated fluorenes and acetylenes, the couplings among them generate large transition dipole moments. The overall transition dipoles of these chromophores should therefore be taken into consideration to describe the S0–Sx transition and the absorption. From the amplitudes of the transition dipoles and the oscillator strengths mentioned above, it is also found that the absorptions attributed to the branches is stronger than that attributed to the pyrene core. Besides the overall transition dipoles, the contribution of each chromophore is also marked in Fig. 4.
From Soup: 39 Comparing with the absorption band of T1 , we find that the absorption band of T2 is significantly broadened, red-shifted and strengthened. This is because the conjugation length of the branch chromophores in T2 is larger than that of T1 , and the increase in the conjugation length brings about a lower excitation energy, a larger delocalization extent of the excited states and larger transition dipole moments, which in turn enhance the intensity of absorptions. Comparing the CDD contours of T1 and T2 , it is found that the increase of conjugation length in the branches not only enhances the delocalization feature of the excited states distribution but also lowers the excitation energy. Two extra molecular models were also made: Molecular Model 1 ( M1 , shown in the ESI † as Fig. S7) is the T1 molecule without the ending of carbazole and Molecular Model 2 ( M2 , shown in the ESI † as Fig. S8) is the M1 molecule without the ending of benzene ring. Calculations and analyses similar to those carried out on T1–T4 were also carried out on M1 and M2, and the results are shown in the ESI † (Fig. S11, S12 and Table S7). Similar to the tendency from T2 to T1 , the calculated results from M1 and M2 further prove that the reduction in conjugation length causes not only the loss of the excited states distribution area but also the blue-shift and a decrease in the absorption. Similarly, in the cases of T3 and T4 (shown in Table S2 in the ESI † ), we find that, even for the second generation branches, it is true that the increase of conjugation length in the branches lowers the excitation energy, leading to a broader, more intense, and red-shifted absorption spectra.

From Soup: 40 Generally, from the CDD contours and the simulated absorption and emission spectra, it is found that the lowest excited state (S 1 ), from which state the fluorescence is emitted, is localized in the pyrene core, while the excited states with higher energy are delocalized overall chromophores distributed in the branches. When the conjugated fluorene and acetylene in branches are excited, the excitation energy is eventually transferred to the pyrene core before the fluorescence emission as a result of the “antenna effect”, and, furthermore, the “antenna effect” could be largely enhanced by introducing new branches into the molecular system.
 ###### 
From cou.: 41 Comparing with the absorption band of T1, we find that the absorption band of T2 is significantly broadened, red-shifted and strengthened. This is because the conjugation length of the branch chromophores in T2 is larger than that of T1, and the increase in the conjugation length brings about a lower excitation energy, a larger delocalization extent of the excited states and larger transition dipole moments, which in turn enhance the intensity of absorptions.

From Soup: 41 The features of the 10 nm scale molecular models introduced in the previous section and the consistency with the 2 nm scale models were tested. However, to verify the correctness of the 10 nm scale molecular models, quantitative experimental evidence is indispensable. For this purpose, the excitation energies and the transition dipoles among the electronic states were determined from the molecular models. Thus, these data were tested by experimental measurements. The fluorescence excitation anisotropy spectrum is quite sensitive to the change in the transition dipole moments, and therefore it is an effective measurement for excitation energy transfer in multi-chromophore systems. 8,47,74–77 According to eqn (8) , the angle between absorption and emission could be determined from the fluorescence excitation anisotropy spectra data. Fig. 5 shows the calculated fluorescence excitation anisotropy spectra of T1–T4 , which are in agreement with the experimentally observed fluorescence excitation anisotropy spectra. 8

From cou.: 42 Generally, from the CDD contours and the simulated absorption and emission spectra, it is found that the lowest excited state (S1), from which state the fluorescence is emitted, is localized in the pyrene core, while the excited states with higher energy are delocalized overall chromophores distributed in the branches. When the conjugated fluorene and acetylene in branches are excited, the excitation energy is eventually transferred to the pyrene core before the fluorescence emission as a result of the “antenna effect”, and, furthermore, the “antenna effect” could be largely enhanced by introducing new branches into the molecular system.
From Soup: 42 As shown in Fig. 5 , at the red side of the first absorption band in the region of 430–550 nm, where the absorption is dominated by the π–π* transition of the only pyrene core, the absorption and emission transition dipoles are unique and parallel, therefore the anisotropy is relatively high (close to 0.4, the theoretical maximum from eqn (8) ). In the region of the second absorption band between 350 nm and 430 nm, where the absorption is controlled by numerous chromophores over all the branches, the angle between the absorption and emission transition dipoles is relatively large.

Fig. 5 shows the calculated fluorescence excitation anisotropy spectra of T1–T4, which are in agreement with the experimentally observed fluorescence excitation anisotropy spectra.8
From Soup: 43 In the case of T1 , as shown in Fig. 5 , the angle reaches about 70°; therefore, the anisotropy is relatively low, viz. , down to −0.1. In the region below 350 nm, the anisotropy increases a little, as the angle between the transition dipole moments of S 0 –S 6 and S 0 –S 1 is relatively small (as shown in Fig. 5a ). In the case of T2–T4 , a similar trend could be seen (see the data in Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI † ).

From Soup: 44 In general, in the region of the first and second absorption bands, the calculated fluorescence excitation anisotropy spectra agree well with the experimental data. 8 This means that not only could the amplitude be successfully described but the direction could be as well. In addition, the calculated transition dipole moments as well as the excitation energy agree with the practical system very well. Unfortunately, due to the lack of consideration of the high energy excited states, the simulated spectra deviate from the experimental results on the blue side.

From Soup: 45 Subsequently, most of the quantitative parameters determined from the multi-scaled molecular models were tested using experimental data. The excitation energies were verified by absorption spectra, while the molecular structures and vibrational modes were verified by the band-shapes of the absorption and emission spectra. The excitation energy distributions and amplitudes and directions of the transition dipole moments from the ground state to the excited states were verified by the absorption and fluorescence excitation anisotropy spectra. However, the transition dipole moments among the excited states have not been confirmed from the experimental data. Nevertheless, using the nonlinear optical measures, these data could be solved. To acquire a comprehensive understanding of the system of T-series dendrimers, two-photon absorption (2PA) spectra were simulated to evaluate the transition dipoles among the excited states to test the molecular model. Furthermore, owing to the potential applications of these dendrimers in three-dimensional microfabrication, photodynamic therapy, high-density optical storage, frequency up-converted lasing, and bio-imaging, the nonlinear optical process of 2PA has rapidly grown into an area of intensive research in recent decades, and much effort has been made to design and synthesize molecules with high 2PA efficiency. 8,31,36,41,45,66,78 The design and synthesis of the T-series dendrimers is exactly as one of these attempts. To further investigate the mechanism of how inter-molecular coupling contributes to the enhancement of the 2PA cross-section, the ground state and the lowest 30 excited states and the transition dipole moments between each two states were considered, and the transition energy and transition dipoles between the excited states and ground states were then calculated as follows.

From Soup: 46 From the calculation results of the 2PA cross-sections using the Sum-Over-States method, we found that in the region of 610–850 nm, a three state model covers all the important contributions. According to eqn (5) and (6) , the main contributions to the 2PA cross-sections in the region of the 610–850 nm band (corresponding to the 1PA band from 305–425 nm) are from the term μ fm · μ m 0 /( ω m 0 − ω ), where μ fm and μ m 0 are the transition dipole moments from state m to the final state f and from the ground state to state m , respectively, ω m 0 is the excitation energy from the ground state to the excited state m, and ω is the wavelength of the photon absorbed. To obtain the maximum of μ fm · μ m 0 /( ω m 0 − ω ), state m should be S 1 or S 2 so that ω m 0 − ω could reach the minimum, and moreover the transition dipole moments μ fm and μ m 0 should be large and collinear. The dendrimer structures of T1–T4 make it possible to acquire especially large 2PA cross-sections. First, the excitation energy of the S 1 state, which is distributed in the pyrene core, is much lower than the other excited states, and therefore the value ω m 0 − ω is considerably reduced, which brings about an enhancement in 2PA. Second, the large conjugation system promotes charge delocalization and increases the transition dipole moments, leading to the enlargement of the 2PA cross-section. Then, the cross-linked branches bring about more probability for the collinear nature of the transition dipole moments, which again enhances the 2PA. Therefore, understanding these structure–property relationships of dendrimers could be much helpful for the synthesis of such types of photo-functional materials with large TPA cross-sections.

From Soup: 47 Fig. 6 shows the two-photon absorption spectra of the T-series dendrimers. For comparison, the corresponding one-photon absorption spectra are also shown in Fig. 6 . It is found that in a broad band from 610 nm to 870 nm, these T-series dendrimers have very intensive two-photon absorptions. Because the one-photon and two-photon excitations follow different selection rules, the shape of the 2PA spectrum is quite different from the corresponding 1PA spectrum of the corresponding molecule. 8

From Soup: 48 In regards to the T-series dendrimers mentioned here, the high energy excited states (with excitation energies above 3.55 eV) have the most intense 2PA band at around 650 nm, and still the relatively lower excited states (with excitation energies of 2.88 eV to 3.55 eV) have the most intense 1PA. Unfortunately, as a result of the lack of consideration of the high energy excited states with excitation energies above 3.55 eV, the strong 2PA bands of T3 and T4 could not be correctly described, and therefore the calculated 2PA spectra of T3 and T4 are not included in Fig. 6 .
 ###### 
From cou.: 49 Fig. 6 shows the two-photon absorption spectra of the T-series dendrimers. For comparison, the corresponding one-photon absorption spectra are also shown in Fig. 6. It is found that in a broad band from 610 nm to 870 nm, these T-series dendrimers have very intensive two-photon absorptions. Because the one-photon and two-photon excitations follow different selection rules, the shape of the 2PA spectrum is quite different from the corresponding 1PA spectrum of the corresponding molecule.8
From Soup: 49 In this study, a practical multi-leveled theoretical investigation was established to determine the structure-related spectral properties for T-series dendrimers based on a proposed molecular model. Molecular models were built on a 2 nm scale for the basic chromophores to determine the excitation energies and the absorption and emission band-shapes of the T-series dendrimers. Based on the molecular models and CAM-B3LYP and TD-CAM-B3LYP calculations, the molecular structures, vibrational properties, and electronic densities of these basic chromophores were determined, and the experimental absorption and emission spectra were successfully reproduced. Overall molecular models were built on a 10 nm scale for the dendrimers T1–T4 . The ZINDO method was employed to simulate the electron properties of the whole dendrimers. Based on the molecular models, the experimental data of the absorption spectra, the fluorescence excitation anisotropy spectra and the 2PA spectra were all accurately emulated. Therefore, the correctness of the models was verified. Moreover, calculations from the 2 nm scale molecular models and those from the 10 nm models agreed fairly well.

From Soup: 50 As a result, the “antenna effect” in the dendrimer molecules was theoretically studied and visualized by studying the contours of the charge different density (CDD) between the electronic states. It was found that the excitation energy was localized from the chromophores in the branches to the pyrene core before the fluorescence emission. Furthermore, according to the calculation results, it was found that increasing the generation of branches enhances the absorption with absorption wavelengths below 430 nm, while increasing the conjugation of branches enhances the coupling among the chromophores and lowers the excitation energy. The investigation of the 2PA spectra also proved that the existence of inter-molecular couplings among the “antenna” chromophores in conjugated branches and the pyrene core significantly promotes the two photons absorption. Therefore, these structure–properties of dendrimers explored here could be used in a suitable design strategy for the synthesis of advanced materials with large 2PA cross-sections. The straightforward strategy of creating a large conjugation plane or adding branches would be helpful in local adjustment, but as shown by the whole spectra of the dendrimer, the effect of inter-chromophore interactions should be comprehensively considered.
