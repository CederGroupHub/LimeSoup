From cou.: 1 Modern pulsed X-ray sources permit time-dependent measurements of dynamical changes in atoms and molecules via non-resonant scattering. The planning, analysis, and interpretation of such experiments, however, require a firm and elaborated theoretical framework. This paper provides a detailed description of time-resolved X-ray scattering by non-stationary electronic wave packets in atomic systems. A consistent application of the Waller–Hartree approximation is discussed and different contributions to the total differential scattering signal are identified and interpreted. Moreover, it is demonstrated how the scattering signal of wave packets in the hydrogen atom can be expressed analytically. This permits simulations without numerical integration and establishes a benchmark for both efficiency and accuracy. Based on that, scattering patterns of an exemplary wave packet in the hydrogen atom are computed for different points in time. In doing so, distinct features of time-resolved X-ray scattering by non-stationary electronic wave packets are illustrated and accentuated in greater detail than it has been done before.

From cou.: 2 Recent advances in the generation of coherent, intense, and ultrashort X-ray pulses provide novel and promising opportunities for imaging rapid dynamics in atoms and molecules via non-resonant time-resolved scattering. Current X-ray Free-Electron Laser facilities permit measurements with temporal resolutions of the order of tenths of femtoseconds1–4 and allow tracking nuclear motions and structural changes in chemical reactions in real time.5–12 The durations of these pulses may be further decreased to attoseconds in the future.13–17 It can thus be assumed that temporal changes in the X-ray scattering signal due to even faster electronic motions will be detectable.

From cou.: 3 The interpretation of such changes, however, is significantly complicated by the quantum mechanical nature of the motion of bound electrons, the non-classical character of the light–matter interaction, and the lack of intensification of coherent scattering as in Bragg diffraction by crystalline matter. It has already been pointed out that the scattering signal of non-stationary electronic wave packets in atoms and molecules does not reveal their instantaneous electron densities.18 The semi-classical approach successfully applied in static X-ray scattering, i.e. the assignment of the signal to the Fourier transform of those densities, was proven to be inadequate. Instead, the scattering event has to be described by quantum electrodynamics, taking into account that photons are quantized excitations of electromagnetic field modes.19

From cou.: 4 In order to exploit the potential of X-ray scattering experiments with femto- or attosecond resolution, a firm and elaborate theoretical framework for their planning, analysis, and interpretation is necessary. This has been pioneered in the nineties20–22 and was addressed in several recent publications.18,23–30 Nevertheless, some aspects of the theory remain opaque. Though the equations provided in the references are compact and generally applicable, the immediate insights they provide are relatively limited. A deeper understanding of the characteristics of time-resolved X-ray scattering requires a more detailed and more specific analysis.

From cou.: 6 In time-resolved X-ray scattering experiments, a pulse of electromagnetic radiation prepares a non-stationary wave function |Ψ(t)〉 by excitation of a material system initially in its ground state. Subsequently, a second pulse of X-rays is scattered. The time lag between these two pulses is referred to as the pump–probe delay. The evolution of |Ψ(t)〉 describes the dynamics of the system that is to be probed at different pump–probe delays. In the following, the wave function is assumed to be a non-stationary electronic wave packet:

From cou.: 11 Due to the ωs-dependence of the q-vector, the two scattering matrix elements in eqn (2) are involved in the integral over the frequency. If ωs ≈ ω0, however, q and thus LfiLfj* become independent of ωs. This assumption was first used by Waller and Hartree31 and is sometimes termed as the “elastic approximation”. Despite its name, it does not imply that the scattering becomes purely elastic. It is only assumed that the transfer of energy between the photon and the material system is small compared to the mean photon energy of the probe pulse and that its effect on q is negligible. This is well justified as long as the transition energies of the material system are orders of magnitude lower than the mean energies of the incident photons. Since the relevant electronic eigenstates of atoms and molecules are typically separated by not more than a few electron volts, this condition is usually satisfied in time-resolved X-ray scattering with photon energies of several keV. Hence, eqn (2) becomes:

 ###### 
From cou.: 13 The lower and upper limits of the integral are defined by a detection window of ±Δω around the mean angular frequency ω0. It is important to note that Δω has to be small in comparison with ω0 in order to be consistent with the approximation introduced above. In a previous derivation,25 it was assumed that the integral runs from zero to infinity, meaning that all photons are detected regardless of their energies. This resulted in an expression for time-dependent incoherent scattering published already in 1998,22 but violates, strictly speaking, the condition under which eqn (4) is justified. Consequently, the information contained in scattering by single electrons is lost, as discussed in the ESI.† It is therefore necessary to restrict the range of detection to scattered photons with frequencies in the vicinity of ω0.

From cou.: 14 The function Wfij(Δω) imposes a weight on the terms of the sum over f in eqn (4). It accounts for the number of incident X-ray photons with frequencies that can be shifted by ωfij to frequencies ωs within the detection range of ±Δω around ω0. The shift ωfij corresponds to an inelastic energy transfer between the photon and the wave packet. Since the value of Wfij(Δω) decreases with an increase in ωfij, the function effectively introduces an upper limit into the sum over f.

From cou.: 15 Eqn (4) is similar to the expression used in the seminal contribution by Dixit et al.18 There are, however, some differences: first, eqn (4) is not based on the assumption that the dynamics of the wave packet is frozen during the scattering process. The convolution with I(t) is explicitly taken into account. Second, the limits of integration in eqn (5) have been introduced as a direct consequence of the approximation ωs ≈ ω0. Third, eqn (4) is written in terms of scattering matrix elements and not as one compact expectation value of density operators. This permits further simplifications and facilitates the identification, physical interpretation, and evaluation of separable contributions.

From cou.: 18 Due to the real part in eqn (8), Zij(t) is invariant under interchange of its sub- and superscript. Hence, the N × N sized matrix of all elements is symmetric. This permits the reduction of the double sum in eqn (6) to j > i and results in the factor of 2. Since Di contains no time variable, only Zij(t) is convoluted with the intensity time profile I(t) and Di is simply multiplied by the total integrated intensity .

The exponential factor exp(−(ωijσ)2/2) accounts for the effect of the finite duration of the probe pulse. It is always smaller than one and decreases rapidly with an increasing ratio of the pulse duration to the period of the oscillation, dp/Tij, where Tij = 2π/ωij. Hence, the exponential factor determines to what extent the time-dependent modulation of the scattering signal can be temporally resolved.

 ###### 
From cou.: 26 Note that in the framework of eqn (11) and (13), a shorter pulse duration implies a larger frequency bandwidth, since σ defines the widths of both I(t) and F(ωs + ωfij). Consequently, a decrease in the pulse duration results in a reduction of the number of photons with angular frequencies inside of ω0 ± Δω and thereby leads to a decrease in the intensity of the detected scattering signal. It is important to emphasize that each term of Di and Oij in eqn (7) and (10), is affected differently by this decrease in intensity: Every contribution to the scattering signal corresponds to a particular transfer of energy ωfij. If the contribution is elastic, the angular frequency ωfij is zero and eqn (14) simplifies to . This function vanishes as σ → 0 and approaches unity as σ → ∞. If at least two of the indices in eqn (14) are different, however, Wfij becomes zero for both σ → 0 and σ → ∞ and displays an optimum in between. The value of σ where this optimum occurs depends on both ωfij and Δω.

 ###### 
From cou.: 27 Physically, this can be understood as follows: If the frequency bandwidth of the incident probe pulse is smaller than ω0 ± Δω, almost all elastically scattered photons are detected. If the bandwidth is increased, less photons fall into the range of detection and the signal becomes weaker. For inelastically scattered photons the situation is different. Only photons with angular frequencies that fall into ω0 ± Δω after a shift by ωfij are detected. If both Δω and the frequency bandwidth are small in comparison to ωfij, most photons are scattered to energies outside of the range of detection and the signal is weak.

From cou.: 28 A loss of time-dependent modulation of the scattering signal at very short probe pulse durations was reported by Dixit et al.18 In the present context, such a loss is ascribed to the coherence of the probe pulse and a finite width of the detection window: For a given Δω, the weights Wfij in eqn (7) and (10) define a frequency bandwidth (or pulse duration) that permits the detection of the largest proportion of photons that carry time-dependent information. This explanation deviates from the previously published one that related the loss of contrast to the time-scale of the electronic motion18 and will be further illustrated in Section 5.

It has therefore been suggested to relate the time-dependent scattering of non-stationary wave packets to absolute squares of Fourier transforms of the time-dependent one-electron density.29 However, such an approach essentially leads to wrong results, as has been revealed by Dixit et al.18 In order to understand the fundamental difference of the more involved description given in the previous section, it is illustrative to re-express eqn (7) and (10) in terms of expectation values of the one-electron density operator ρfi(r) and their Fourier transforms from r- into q-space:

From cou.: 32 Eqn (17) shows that the element Di is a weighted sum of absolute squares of Fourier transformed expectation values of the one-electron density operator ρfi(r) associated with the state |ψi〉. The diagonal term with f = i describes coherent elastic scattering on the one-electron density. The off-diagonal terms with f ≠ i allow for inelastic energy transfer from the incident X-ray photon to the material system or vice versa by electronic Raman transitions. If the expectation values of the one-electron density operator ρfi are real—a condition that will be fulfilled when the eigenstates are chosen to be real—the pattern of Di has to be centrosymmetric in q-space, i.e. the inversion center has to be an element of its corresponding point group. This requirement is a consequence of the occurrence of the absolute squares of the Fourier transforms in eqn (17) and known as Friedel's law.32

From cou.: 33 In contrast, the element Oij in eqn (18) involved in the time-dependent part of the scattering signal is not related to the absolute square of a single Fourier transform and may therefore give rise to a non-centrosymmetric pattern. It is a weighted sum of products of two different, Fourier transformed expectation values of the one-electron density operator and describes scattering by two eigenstates that are superposed in the wave packet. Thus, the element Oij reveals non-local correlations of the X-ray photon and the evolving material system in the scattering process. Together with the off-diagonal contributions to Di, it accounts for the quantum mechanical nature of the light-matter interaction.18

From cou.: 34 In the following, the general considerations of the last section will be applied to electronic wave packets of superposed eigenstates in the hydrogen atom. The matrix elements in Di and Oij can, in principle, be evaluated directly in a basis of real-valued atomic orbitals. It is possible to expand the scattering operator in terms of spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics18,24 and to evaluate the angular integrals analytically by use of Clebsch–Gordon coefficients.33 For the remaining radial integrals, however, no analytic solution is known. Hence, it is necessary to evaluate them numerically—a task that is computationally demanding even for the hydrogen atom.18 As will be demonstrated in this section, one can overcome this obstacle and obtain completely analytic solutions, if the original wave packet is transformed into an eigenstate basis of the field-free Hamiltonian in parabolic coordinates:34,35

Hence, it is necessary to evaluate them numerically—a task that is computationally demanding even for the hydrogen atom. 18 As will be demonstrated in this section, one can overcome this obstacle and obtain completely analytic solutions, if the original wave packet is transformed into an eigenstate basis of the field-free Hamiltonian in parabolic coordinates: 34,35

From cou.: 37 The scattering matrix elements in eqn (7) and (10) have the general form 〈ψf||ψi〉. With parabolic eigenstates of the hydrogen atom, the corresponding integrals can be evaluated analytically if the scattering vector q is aligned with the z-axis, meaning q = qez. The full three-dimensional scattering can be obtained thereafter by rotation of the z-axis around the material system, as will be described later. Hence, the scattering operator that refers to the electron in the hydrogen atom becomes:

From Soup: 85 Eqn (36) and (37) can be deduced from eqn (19) and (22) : a parabolic eigenstate is complex only in the exponential e ιmφ .

If, in contrast, only one vector is complex conjugate, the difference m i − m f in eqn (23) is transformed into the sum m i + m f .

Time-resolved X-ray scattering patterns of this wave packet have already been calculated numerically by Dixit et al. 18 The compact density operator formalism the authors have used to demonstrate the difference between the quantized and the semi-classical descriptions of the scattering, however, makes a more detailed analysis of the nature of the patterns difficult.

From cou.: 91 In the following, the results of Sections 2 and 4 are applied to an electronic wave packet of superposed and equally weighted |3dz2〉 and |4fz3〉 orbitals of the hydrogen atom. Time-resolved X-ray scattering patterns of this wave packet have already been calculated numerically by Dixit et al.18 The compact density operator formalism the authors have used to demonstrate the difference between the quantized and the semi-classical descriptions of the scattering, however, makes a more detailed analysis of the nature of the patterns difficult.

From Soup: 91 The off-diagonal element in eqn (42) contains the same matrix elements as eqn (40) and (41) . These matrix elements have to be evaluated once and then all three elements, D 3 , D 4 , and O 3,4 , can be formed as their corresponding products. Following the previous section, exact solutions to the matrix elements are obtainable by expansion in the parabolic eigenstate basis. Note that only the states involved in the wave packet, but not the vectors | ψ f 〉 have to be rotated by eqn (32) and (34) . The sum over f includes all states degenerate in m once and is therefore unaffected by rotation. Further details of the evaluation are given in the ESI. †
 ###### 
From cou.: 92 By use of atomic units and eqn (1), the non-stationary electronic wave packet is defined as:
From Soup: 92 Here, the sum over f in eqn (40)–(42) has been truncated at the principal quantum number n f = 50. The values of D 3 , D 4 , and 2 Im[ O 3,4 ] at the converged q -space coordinates of the maximum of Im[ O 3,4 ] at different values of truncation n f are shown in Fig. 2 . Following Dixit et al. , 18 it is assumed that the incident X-ray probe pulse propagates along the y -axis and has a mean photon energy of 〈 E 0 〉 = 4 keV and a time duration (FWHM) of d p = 1 fs. All scattered photons within the range of ±Δ ω = 0.25 eV around 〈 E 0 〉 are detected. It becomes apparent that in all three cases electronic states with principal quantum numbers above n f ≈ 20 contribute only negligibly to the total value. Physically, every matrix element that involves a vector | ψ f 〉 with n f ∉ {3,4} corresponds to an electronic Raman transition induced by inelastic scattering of a photon. Thus, the convergence of the values in Fig. 2 can be related to the fact that transitions to electronic states in the proximity of those already occupied in the wave packet are the most probable to contribute to the detected scattering signal. The convergence in Fig. 2 also illustrates that it is not generally sufficient to approximate the elements D i by their elastic contributions. At the considered q -space coordinate, inelastic scattering accounts for more than 44% of D 3 and 64% of D 4 . This becomes even more dramatic at larger values of q , where inelastic scattering is usually stronger than elastic.
 ###### 
From cou.: 93 The energies in eqn (38) are E3 = −1/18 a.u. ≈ −1.51 eV and E4 = −1/32 a.u. ≈ −0.85 eV. With eqn (6) and (12), the scattering signal of this wave packet is described by:
From Soup: 93 Further evaluation of O 3,4 reveals that its real part vanishes. Eqn (39) therefore reduces to:
 ###### 
From cou.: 94 The indices 3 and 4 in eqn (39) and in the following refer to the |3dz2〉 and |4fz3〉 orbitals, respectively. The angular frequency of the wave packets is ω = 7/288 a.u. ≈ 1.0 fs−1.
From Soup: 94 According to eqn (43) , the differential scattering signal experiences a sinusoidal modulation with pump–probe delay τ over a period of T = 576π/7 a.u. ≈ 6.253 fs. The global magnitude of this modulation is limited by the probe pulse duration , whereas its spatial pattern is described solely by the imaginary part of O 3,4 .
 ###### 
From cou.: 95 According to eqn (7) and (10), the elements in eqn (39) are given as:
From Soup: 95 A contour plot of 2Im[ O 3,4 ] is shown in Fig. 3 . The scattering pattern lies in the q x – q z plane and photons scattered at angles of at most 60° are detected. With the approximation ω s ≈ ω 0 , the norm of the q -vector takes maximum values of q max ≈ 2.03 Å −1 . The pattern in Fig. 3 displays a dihedral D 1 rosette group symmetry that involves a single reflection through the q z -axis. Its values are positive at q z > 0 (or ϕ q < 180°), but negative when q z < 0 (or ϕ q > 180°). As a consequence, the imaginary part of O 3,4 causes the differential scattering signal to oscillate along the q z -axis and breaks any higher symmetry that D 3 and D 4 may have. The pattern is not centrosymmetric and cannot be related to absolute squares of Fourier transformed, real-valued functions, as it has been discussed in Section 3.
 ###### 
From cou.: 96 The off-diagonal element in eqn (42) contains the same matrix elements as eqn (40) and (41). These matrix elements have to be evaluated once and then all three elements, D3, D4, and O3,4, can be formed as their corresponding products. Following the previous section, exact solutions to the matrix elements are obtainable by expansion in the parabolic eigenstate basis. Note that only the states involved in the wave packet, but not the vectors |ψf〉 have to be rotated by eqn (32) and (34). The sum over f includes all states degenerate in m once and is therefore unaffected by rotation. Further details of the evaluation are given in the ESI.†
From Soup: 96 After evaluation of the remaining elements, D 3 + D 4 , the full scattering signal of the wave packet is obtained. In Fig. 4 , scattering patterns computed for five different pump–probe delays τ are shown: at zero, one-fourth, one-half, three-fourth, and one times the period of the oscillation T . They match the patterns published by Dixit et al. 18 With , the exponential in eqn (43) constrains the magnitude by which the element O 3,4 can contribute to at most 91%. Since the time-dependent term in eqn (43) involves a sine function, scattering patterns at zero, one-half, and one times T are described exclusively by the time-independent average D 3 + D 4 . They display a centrosymmetric D 2 rosette group symmetry that contains a two-fold rotation and reflections through both the q x - and the q z -axis. The patterns can correspond to the static average one would measure without any time-resolution. The higher D 2 symmetry of the patterns is broken to D 1 , as soon as the contributions of O 3,4 are non-zero. In between zero and one-fourth times T , the scattering signal is shifted into the upper semi circle of the pattern to azimuthal angles of ϕ q < 180°. At one-fourth of T , most of the intensity is observed at q z > 0. After this, the signal moves downwards in direction of the lower semi circle of the pattern to azimuthal angles of ϕ q > 180°, until the intensity at q z < 0 reaches its maximum at three-fourth of T . Finally, the signal is shifted upwards again, closing the cycle at T .
 ###### 
From cou.: 97 Here, the sum over f in eqn (40)–(42) has been truncated at the principal quantum number nf = 50. The values of D3, D4, and 2 Im[O3,4] at the converged q-space coordinates of the maximum of Im[O3,4] at different values of truncation nf are shown in Fig. 2. Following Dixit et al.,18 it is assumed that the incident X-ray probe pulse propagates along the y-axis and has a mean photon energy of 〈E0〉 = 4 keV and a time duration (FWHM) of dp = 1 fs. All scattered photons within the range of ±Δω = 0.25 eV around 〈E0〉 are detected. It becomes apparent that in all three cases electronic states with principal quantum numbers above nf ≈ 20 contribute only negligibly to the total value. Physically, every matrix element that involves a vector |ψf〉 with nf ∉ {3,4} corresponds to an electronic Raman transition induced by inelastic scattering of a photon. Thus, the convergence of the values in Fig. 2 can be related to the fact that transitions to electronic states in the proximity of those already occupied in the wave packet are the most probable to contribute to the detected scattering signal. The convergence in Fig. 2 also illustrates that it is not generally sufficient to approximate the elements Di by their elastic contributions. At the considered q-space coordinate, inelastic scattering accounts for more than 44% of D3 and 64% of D4. This becomes even more dramatic at larger values of q, where inelastic scattering is usually stronger than elastic.
From Soup: 97 Hence, the scattering patterns in Fig. 4 show temporal variations that have already been deduced from Fig. 3 alone. This illustrates that the elements O ij are of prime importance for the simulation and understanding of the time-resolved differential X-ray scattering signal of non-stationary electronic wave packets.
 ###### 
From cou.: 98 Further evaluation of O3,4 reveals that its real part vanishes. Eqn (39) therefore reduces to:
From Soup: 98 Finally, the effect of the pulse duration d p and the range of detected frequencies Δ ω upon the scattering signal will be illustrated. Fig. 5A shows the total scattering signal at different pump–probe delays τ for one point in q -space and three probe pulse durations d p . The intensity of the signal decreases with d p . As discussed in Section 2, less photons are detected at shorter pulse durations. In Fig. 5B , only the modulation, i.e. the total signal from Fig. 5A minus its time-independent average, is shown. The modulation has a larger amplitude for a pulse duration of 1.0 fs than for 0.1 fs and 4.0 fs. Hence, the amplitude of the modulation has to display an optimum at a pulse duration in the vicinity of 1.0 fs, as also observed previously. 18
 ###### 
From cou.: 99 According to eqn (43), the differential scattering signal experiences a sinusoidal modulation with pump–probe delay τ over a period of T = 576π/7 a.u. ≈ 6.253 fs. The global magnitude of this modulation is limited by the probe pulse duration , whereas its spatial pattern is described solely by the imaginary part of O3,4.
From Soup: 99 This becomes even more apparent in Fig. 6A : the time-independent average D 3 + D 4 approaches zero as d p → 0 and a finite limit as d p → ∞. The amplitude of the time-dependent modulation 2 exp(−( ω ij σ ) 2 /2)Im[ O 3,4 ] becomes zero in both cases and has an optimum in between at d p ≈ 1.63 fs. The amplitude of the relative modulation, defined as the ratio of the absolute amplitude and the average, is displayed in Fig. 6A as well. It approaches a finite value as d p → 0 and zero as d p → ∞. Moreover, it displays an optimum at d p ≈ 1.31 fs. The ratio of detected photons that carry time-dependent information to those that do not is the largest here. This confirms the previously observed, somewhat counterintuitive behaviour that time-dependent scattering signal loses contrast (amplitude of the modulation) at very short probe pulse durations. 18 It can be seen, however, that the scattering signal does not become completely time-independent as d p → 0. Even though the amplitude of the absolute modulation vanishes and the signal may eventually become too weak to be detected, the proportion by which the modulation contributes to the total signal approaches a constant.
 ###### 
From cou.: 100 A contour plot of 2Im[O3,4] is shown in Fig. 3. The scattering pattern lies in the qx–qz plane and photons scattered at angles of at most 60° are detected. With the approximation ωs ≈ ω0, the norm of the q-vector takes maximum values of qmax ≈ 2.03 Å−1. The pattern in Fig. 3 displays a dihedral D1 rosette group symmetry that involves a single reflection through the qz-axis. Its values are positive at qz > 0 (or ϕq < 180°), but negative when qz < 0 (or ϕq > 180°). As a consequence, the imaginary part of O3,4 causes the differential scattering signal to oscillate along the qz-axis and breaks any higher symmetry that D3 and D4 may have. The pattern is not centrosymmetric and cannot be related to absolute squares of Fourier transformed, real-valued functions, as it has been discussed in Section 3.
From Soup: 100 Following the general discussion of Section 2, the existence of the optimum in the amplitude of the modulation can be ascribed to the weights W fij (Δ ω ). The loss of scattering signal and contrast at very short pulse durations is a direct consequence of the limited range of detection Δ ω . As shown in Fig. S3 of the ESI, † not only the modulation but also the inelastic part of the static average displays an optimum. This is expected from the investigation in Section 2. Furthermore, the position of the optimum depends on the value of Δ ω . Fig. 6B reveals that the optimum of the amplitude is shifted towards shorter pulse durations when Δ ω is increased and more photons can be detected.
 ###### 
From cou.: 101 After evaluation of the remaining elements, D3 + D4, the full scattering signal of the wave packet is obtained. In Fig. 4, scattering patterns computed for five different pump–probe delays τ are shown: at zero, one-fourth, one-half, three-fourth, and one times the period of the oscillation T. They match the patterns published by Dixit et al.18 With , the exponential in eqn (43) constrains the magnitude by which the element O3,4 can contribute to at most 91%. Since the time-dependent term in eqn (43) involves a sine function, scattering patterns at zero, one-half, and one times T are described exclusively by the time-independent average D3 + D4. They display a centrosymmetric D2 rosette group symmetry that contains a two-fold rotation and reflections through both the qx- and the qz-axis. The patterns can correspond to the static average one would measure without any time-resolution. The higher D2 symmetry of the patterns is broken to D1, as soon as the contributions of O3,4 are non-zero. In between zero and one-fourth times T, the scattering signal is shifted into the upper semi circle of the pattern to azimuthal angles of ϕq < 180°. At one-fourth of T, most of the intensity is observed at qz > 0. After this, the signal moves downwards in direction of the lower semi circle of the pattern to azimuthal angles of ϕq > 180°, until the intensity at qz < 0 reaches its maximum at three-fourth of T. Finally, the signal is shifted upwards again, closing the cycle at T.
From Soup: 101 The time-resolved X-ray scattering signal of non-stationary electronic wave packets in atomic systems is described in detail and different contributions are identified as the elements D i and O ij . They refer to the static and non-stationary scattering contributions, respectively. Whereas the former corresponds to absolute squares of Fourier transformed expectation values of the one-electron density operator, the latter represents spatial correlations of the X-ray photon and different states of the material system. The time-dependent part of the scattering signal solely comprises these correlations. For a probe pulse with a Gaussian intensity time profile, it is shown that neither the pump–probe delay nor the properties of the pulse enter the matrix elements directly. They are arguments of a function that multiplicatively weights the contribution of O ij . This enables cost-efficient simulations for different points in time under various experimental conditions.
 ###### 
From cou.: 102 Hence, the scattering patterns in Fig. 4 show temporal variations that have already been deduced from Fig. 3 alone. This illustrates that the elements Oij are of prime importance for the simulation and understanding of the time-resolved differential X-ray scattering signal of non-stationary electronic wave packets.
From Soup: 102 Moreover, it is demonstrated how to express the X-ray scattering signal of non-stationary electronic wave packets in the hydrogen atom analytically. By rotation of the wave packet in the parabolic eigenstate basis, the scattering matrix elements can be evaluated exactly without numerical integration. This approach is, in principle, also applicable to atomic systems with single non-stationary Rydberg electrons that are decoupled from the remaining stationary core electrons, as a numerical investigation of scattering by the helium atom 27 suggests. Distinctive features of time-resolved X-ray scattering by non-stationary electronic wave packets are illustrated by reference to the wave packet that has been introduced by Dixit et al. 18 It is shown that the elements O ij are characteristic of time-resolved scattering and determine the symmetry the patterns display. Finally, it has been demonstrated that the loss of contrast of the time-dependent scattering signal at very short probe pulse durations is merely a consequence of the energy resolution of the detector.
 ###### 
From cou.: 103 Finally, the effect of the pulse duration dp and the range of detected frequencies Δω upon the scattering signal will be illustrated. Fig. 5A shows the total scattering signal at different pump–probe delays τ for one point in q-space and three probe pulse durations dp. The intensity of the signal decreases with dp. As discussed in Section 2, less photons are detected at shorter pulse durations. In Fig. 5B, only the modulation, i.e. the total signal from Fig. 5A minus its time-independent average, is shown. The modulation has a larger amplitude for a pulse duration of 1.0 fs than for 0.1 fs and 4.0 fs. Hence, the amplitude of the modulation has to display an optimum at a pulse duration in the vicinity of 1.0 fs, as also observed previously.18
From Soup: 103 A further extension of the analysis presented here could involve a detailed investigation of time-resolved X-ray scattering by diatomic molecules in non-stationary nuclear and electronic states. This may eventually support prospective X-ray scattering experiments that address the electronic time-scale in chemistry. 40–42
 ###### 
From cou.: 104 This becomes even more apparent in Fig. 6A: the time-independent average D3 + D4 approaches zero as dp → 0 and a finite limit as dp → ∞. The amplitude of the time-dependent modulation 2exp(−(ωijσ)2/2)Im[O3,4] becomes zero in both cases and has an optimum in between at dp ≈ 1.63 fs. The amplitude of the relative modulation, defined as the ratio of the absolute amplitude and the average, is displayed in Fig. 6A as well. It approaches a finite value as dp → 0 and zero as dp → ∞. Moreover, it displays an optimum at dp ≈ 1.31 fs. The ratio of detected photons that carry time-dependent information to those that do not is the largest here.
