From cou.: 1 Bacterial systems offer excellent tests of how well the general theoretical predictions of ecology dynamics do or do not in fact conform to reality. We believe that the basic rules that govern the cohabitation of competing species for limited resources are the same from bacteria to man, we just don't know the rules, and that fundamental studies of the games bacteria play will give fundamental insight into the vastly more complex systems we hope to attack later. In this tutorial review we discuss how simplified micro-ecologies constructed using tools of micro and nanofabrication techniques offer some idea of how physical principles and analysis can address the issue of complex ecology dynamics.

From cou.: 2 Ecology is typically defined as the science of the relationships between organisms and their environments. An ecology is a complex environment which contains multiple species competing for resources and changing the environment due to the competition. In order for the organisms to change the environment, it must have a limited input, limited in the sense that growth and metabolism by the organisms substantially change the local environment. Ecologies of course span an enormous range of length scales, in this review we will be concentrating on “micro-ecologies” but not the kind of micro-ecology you will find if you Google that word. Rather, we are talking about using microfabrication (and nanofabrication) to a series of interconnected micro-ecologies. Each microfabricated micro-ecology is called a microhabitat patch, and the patches when linked together form a more complex ecology with internal interactions which can be quite surprising and informative. While one doesn't normally associate nanotechnology with ecology, but in our case the connection to nanotechnology is simply that we use nanoslits to allow for diffusive connections between micro-ecologies and external food reservoirs, so that indeed the organisms do indeed strongly influence their local environments via their metabolism and growth.

From cou.: 3 Ordinarily a tutorial review acts as a review of the literature and use of a technology for a somewhat mature field. The field of microhabitat patch dynamics is very new, and the literature is rather sparse. The work of the Austin lab which will be primarily examined here, but other groups have also become involved in this effort, amongst them is the Delft group,1 the University of California effort2 and the Stanford effort.3 We hope more will be joining this new attack in the dynamics of ecologies using micro and nanofabrication techniques.

From cou.: 4 A crucial concept in this tutorial review, in addition to the use of nanoslits to regulate food, is the presence of more than one strain of organism, so that competition ensues. In populations of competing organisms, you don't necessarily win if you die with the most offspring. If a shared space with limited resources is occupied by populations with competing phenotypes for handling stress, dominance of the strain adapted to reproduction under stress can result in the extinction of all individuals if the stress adapted strain does not stop reproducing,4,5 a phenomena known as the tragedy of the commons6 In nature, such extinction scenarios due to uncontrolled growth are not the norm, at least for “lower” organisms. The complexity of the environment seems connected to this global fitness optimization problem. Bacteria (for example) segregate their populations into microecological niches in environments as diverse as soil and the contents of the large intestine. This spatial segregation into micro-niches seems to avoid commons tragedies,7 but is difficult to characterize in complex 3-dimensional topologies. We show here that even for a simple 1-D step function habitat landscape of microhabitat spaces a segregation of 2 competing strains of bacteria develops over a large range of length scales and seems to enhance survivorship globally.

From cou.: 5 Bacterial systems offer excellent tests of how well the general theoretical predictions of the tragedy of the commons do or do not in fact conform to reality. But bacterial experiments can also offer more than test general models of accelerated evolution under stress. Bacteria have two other characteristics: (1) different phenotypes, even within a given species (if we can use that word for bacteria), can show prisoner's dilemma kinds of behavior characterized by cooperation, defection, and aggression against other bacteria; (2) they form collective and cooperative multi-cellular collections called biofilms in which a given strain differentiates into collections of cells performing different functions in the biofilm. In that sense, bacteria also can form tissue, and this tissue should be subject to population instabilities and evolution dynamics. We believe the basic rules are the same from bacteria to man in terms of ecology dynamics, we just don't know the rules, and that fundamental studies of the games bacteria play will give fundamental insight into the vastly more complex systems we hope to attack later.

From cou.: 6 Typically bacteria are cultured in millilitre volumes and stirred culture tubes. Further, they typically have a rather rich medium such as Luria-Bertani broth (LB) broth which supplies all of the basic nutrient needs. Under these conditions, bacterial growth is basically exponential in time until the density of bacteria ρ reaches the carrying capacity K of the environment, at which point they enter stationary phase which can be considered a cooperative phenotypic response where the growth rate R effectively goes to zero. The logistic eqn (1) is the standard expression for this self-limiting growth: This equation yields the classic sigmoidal curve which flattens at long times as the bacterial cease growth due to sensing of a combination of cell density and/or media depletion. The emergence of growth cessation is an emergent phenotype under stress and the bacteria are said to be in stationary phase. At this point the bacteria are quiescent and not much is happening.

From cou.: 7 Is that true? Roberto Kolter of Harvard, in a pioneering series of experiments,8,9 showed that the bacteria in a depleted medium undergo genomic evolution over a period of days in the stationary phase as cells die and are replaced with new mutant cells with a different genome. This genome expresses a phenotype, called GASP for Growth Advantage in Stationary Phase. Fig. 1 is a schematic view of the genomic dynamics driven by stress that Kolter discovered.

From cou.: 8 The genome that evolves expresses a phenotype which is optimized for survival under conditions of metabolic stress. These GASP mutants can be considered, in a sense, defectors in a Prisoner's Dilemma game.10 Both GASP mutants and wild-type cells have decreasing survival rate with increasing GASP population fraction, reminiscent of how both cooperators and defectors suffer the so-called “sucker's payoff” and “punishment” when they interact with defectors. The wild-type cells have a lower survival rate than the GASP mutants, suggesting they are the “suckers,” i.e. the cooperators as can be seen in Vulic and Kolter's survivorship assays.11 Evolutionary game theory predicts that defectors will overwhelm the population under high stress conditions, which, following the tragedy of the commons the Introduction outlined, would lead to the extinction of all individuals. However, reality is more complicated than that.

From cou.: 9 Kolter's experiments were done in culture tubes that allowed facile mixing of the contents, in which case evolutionary game theory predicts a fixing of the GASP mutation in all individuals, and in that sense the genetic population dynamics are not heterogenous but instead serially homogeneous as defections proceed each other. However, in an ecology where the cells are split into many local populations global fixation of 1 mutation is very slow, and true heterogenous genomics can develop stably. Another important point of Kolter's work which has to be emphasized is that the GASP mutation is not some random single nucleotide polymorphism picked out by selection pressure. This clearly cannot be the case based on the rate at which the GASP mutation appears: in 10 days under stationary conditions of slow growth under stress the GASP mutation is fixed in the genome of all individuals. The expression of proteins is controlled by promoter selective binding on RNA polymerase which, for E. coli, is controlled by the known σ factors. This gives rise to the possibility of a global switching of gene expression in bacteria via genetically changing the σ factor genes. In particular, there are a set of σ factor genes, rposD and rpoS, which are known to be connected to response to external metabolic stresses.12 In particular, expression of the rpoS gene, which codes for the σS factor of RNA polymerase, gives strains more resistance to external stress but also gives rise to poor substrate metabolic competence, that is, expression rpoS of requires the organism to utilize complex molecules typically present when wild-strains die and lyse under stress. Thus, a rpoS mutant might be expected to act as a “defector” strain if the mutation gives the organism the ability to grow during stationary phase by metabolizing high energy compounds released by the death and lysis of wild-type RpoS bacteria under conditions of stress. The Kolter lab has found that about 4 days into the stationary phase the mutation is in the rpoS gene. The rpoS819 mutant that we isolated and sequenced has an interesting sequence: it is simply a 48 bp repeat of the adjoining sequence in the rpoS gene, indicating that there is a basic, modular gene sequence insertion used to control the basic GASP phenotype.

From cou.: 10 Landscapes in ecology have a profound influence on the adaption and evolution of competing populations for resources. We are interested in how altruistic populations survive in the presence of selfish individuals in a non-stirred, closed and complex nutrient landscape and think it connects directly to the dynamics of tumors and the transition to metastasis. Well-stirred (landscape-free) but closed environments have a depressing future when selfish individuals arise in a population. Over-exploitation of a well-stirred communal habitat by selfish individuals which do not follow rules of communal self-regulation ends up in the elimination (extinction) of both the original altruistic inhabitants and the selfish population. In the context of bacterial population, the commons tragedy that occurs is the consumption of limited resources by the individuals, resulting in metabolic stressing of the bacteria and growth advantages to be gained by defection from a “social contract” of altruistic cooperation. There is no avoidance of this tragedy and the collapse of an original altruistic wild-type population by an emergent selfish population in a well-stirred but closed environment is inevitable. However, there is a fundamental difference between resource exploitation in a well-stirred homogeneous commons and in a heterogenous landscape of nutrients which is not stirred.13

From cou.: 11 The technology we have developed to test adaption and evolution dynamics in cell metapopulations, originally in bacterial ones, is extremely simple and is based on 4 physics lessons. The 4 lessons are: (1) optimal strategies are unstable in the presence of self-interested defectors; (2) fitness landscapes can be explored most rapidly by a heterogeneous distribution, or metapopulation, of inter-breeding subpopulations; (3) breaking a population of N genomes into many smaller quasi-species ni on a fitness landscape greatly increases the odds of fixing rare outlier but more fit genomes; (4) the effect of severe stress in activating mutator genes. In fact, in a non-stirred nanofabricated habitat landscape, altruists and selfish bacteria can in fact coexist; they can maintain phenotype diversity and avoid the tragedy of the commons. This emergent spatial segregation of competing populations under stress greatly changes, we believe, our perception of the true sophistication of bacterial response to stress and competition, and has broad implications for the adaptive strategies of higher organisms under stress in complex environments.

From cou.: 12 Fig. 2 shows the device we microfabricated which meets these 4 criteria for accelerated evolution. The first version is a simple linear (one-dimensional) device, we will discuss 2 and 3 D devices shortly. There were 2 central ideas in this original design: break the population into small inter-connected subpopulations (points (2) and (3) above) and design in landscapes of stress (point (4) above). Breaking of the population into smaller but interconnected subpopulations is straightforward using microfabrication techniques: small squares with narrow channels connect the subpopulations. A trickier step is creating a stress landscape. In our case we used a nanofabrication technique and etched 10 very thin slits (5 on each side) from a broth reservoir to the small subpopulation squares. These nanoslits diffusively couple in food from the external reservoir. Since the food flux is diffusively coupled in, too rapid a growth can quickly make the small microsquare anaerobic and depleted in nutrients. The microsquares are not all created equal because the nanoslits can also be closed and opened either during the fabrication process or (in principle) during the experiment, something we will do in the future as discussed below.

From cou.: 14 The first experiment involved a very simple fitness landscape of black and white:14 no nano feeding slits open in 43 contiguous microsquares (the “black” region), all 10 nano feeding slits open in 42 contiguous microsquares (the “white” region). The E. coli wild type (WT) strain used was a motile strain with RP437 transformed with a high copy plasmid expressing ampicillin resistance and GFP expression (pGFPmut2). The plasmid produces GFP at a very high rate and is metabolically stressed because of this high and unnecessary GFP production, yet it also provides ampicillin resistance and so the plasmid is essential for survival. When the WT strain is introduced into the 1-D lattice it grows exponentially and in 6 h has grown to very high densities, the equivalent of 5 OD/cm in a culture tube. At this point the stress is such that the cell death is very high and the bacterial count plummets by over a factor of 1000. Over the next 2 days of time the cell count fluctuates and remains basically low, however after about 4 days the bacteria start to grow again, more slowly, but ultimately to higher densities. It is difficult to know the true average number of generations that occurred over the 80 h of the experiment, but we can calculate based on GFP turnover that about 10 generations occurred. The interesting phenomena we observed in these initial experiments was that the bacterial phenotype changed dramatically under stress: from rapid growth only in the relatively higher food access microsquares to a slower but sustained growth in both the high stress and low stress regions, as is shown in Fig. 3.

From cou.: 15 Note that this phenotype of growth under high stress is similar to the GASP mutants that Kolter observed in prolonged stationary phase, but that it occurs in a shorter time scale and with a more pronounced die-off of the original strain. In fact, our observations are that in microhabitats that the phenotypic extremes are more pronounced and occur at shorter time scales. We believe this phenomena of a change in phenotype under high stress is associated with the SOS response and accomplished by large scale mutations in critical control regions of RNAP polymerase associated with the α protein subunit that controls the binding specificity of RNA polymerase to certain promoter sites on the E. coli genome. These genes are connected with the SOS phenomena and in particular the rpoS response.

From cou.: 16 The above experiment was a test of the rate at which a single strain of bacteria could adapt to an environment in the absence of competition from other strains. It strongly resembled the initial Kolter experiments, and avoided the issue of what happens when defection occurs in a complex ecology. We did a second set of experiments.15 to address the dynamics of the outcome of defection, with rather surprising results. For these experiments we isolated GASP mutants from wild-type E. coli bacteria which had been incubated in stationary phase for several weeks. The defector strain (rpoS819) was made by P1 phage transduction from a GASP wildtype which is initially the strain W3110. We moved (P1 transduction) rpoS alleles into bacterial strain carrying fluorescent proteins (GFP and RFP) inserted in the lac operon. The lacYZ::GFP2 construct is a rpoS 819 (green) strain and was assigned the name JEK1032, and the construct W3110 (lacYZ::mRFP-1, rpoS 819 (red) = JEK1033). Wild-type strains (rpoS wt) carrying the wt allele were also made in a similar fashion: JEK1036 = W3110 lacYZ::GFPmut2, rpoS wt (green) and (red) JEK 1037 = W3110 lacYZ::mRFP-1, rpoS wt. In this manner, we are able to track the GASP mutants and the wild-type bacteria both by their fluorescence spectrum and their phenotype behavior. These experiments were most likely too short (40 h) for any stress-induced gene transposition to occur.

From cou.: 17 The mutation that gives rise to the GASP phenotype, which is driven by stress, is interesting in that it shows how non-random these changes are. In the case of the GASP mutants studied above, in order to sequence the rpoS locus around the insertion which gives rise to the GASP allele, we used a forward primer rpoS-Fwd-Kolter 5-TCACCCGTGAACGTGTTC-3 and reverse primer rpoS-Rev-Kolter 5-GTTAACGACCATTCTCG-3. DNA sequencing of the PCR products was done using GENEWIZ service to determine rpoS allele status, this gene analysis is shown in Fig. 4. The sequencing revealed that the GASP rpos819 mutant consisted of lateral transfers taken from flanking sequences of the rpoS genome: the first part of the rpoS819 sequence (gcaggggctgaatatcgaa) is actually a lateral transfer of the sequence which follows after the insertion, and the last part of the rpoS819 sequence (gcgccgtttgcgcgaaatcctgcaaac) is a lateral transfer of the rpoS sequence which comes before the insertion.

From cou.: 18 The two competing phenotypes, the GASP “defector” mutants and the WT “cooperator” are optically distinguishable because they express different fluorescent proteins, and it is easy to observe the interplay of ‘defectors” and “cooperators” within our structures. The actual dynamics are remarkably complex and not at all the “defector takes all” scenario that evolutionary game theory predicts in a well-mixed environment. Fig. 5 shows the complex communities within each microhabitat that arise in such metapopulation dynamics. Nowak and May in a pioneering study16 showed that a simple 2-dimensional iterative game played by individuals who always defect and individuals which always cooperate can give rise to remarkably complex population patterns when a simple nearest neighbor weighting of the (fixed) strategies of the selfish and altruistic bacteria is iteratively computed to determine the next round of occupants in a lattice. Each lattice occupant receives “points” for each interaction with a lattice neighbor. A lattice site becomes occupied by the type of cell, cooperator or defector, that has won the most points in the vicinity in the preceding tournament. When prisoner's dilemma matrix elements are used for local games in Nowak's simulation, cooperators and defectors can cluster in fluctuating spatial regions.

From cou.: 19 In our case we have a more complex form of Nowak and May's evolutionary game:16 the bacteria (over the time scale of these experiments) have fixed strategies, but the environment itself is allowed to change due to the bacterial defection and cooperation, and nutrients can diffuse in from the external world: this is a substantially more complex but realistic landscape of nutrients and populations we have created than a simple prisoner's dilemma and strictly relevant to tumor dynamics.

From cou.: 20 Surprisingly, it is possible to model such a complex system using a fairly simple nearest-neighbor lattice algorithm and achieve informative and intuitively appealing results. Mathematically, analysis of the systems resembles a spin-glass model.17 We expect that the wild type strains will follow the logistic eqn (1) fairly accurately at least in a fresh, unconditioned LB medium and in the absence of competition with other strains such as the GASP mutant. The logistic equation is a simple but general expression for bacterial growth curves as the medium becomes conditioned, characterized by the growth rate R and the carrying capacity K of the environment which limits exponential growth due to loss of medium quality, and a mortality rate λ. If there are multiple strains present the coupled logistic equation is a simple start, where Jij represents at a simple level the competition between strain i and strain j:

From cou.: 25 This “peaceful coexistence” of two apparently conflicting phenotypes in a complex landscape is in stark contrast to the “all or nothing” scenario of the Kolter experiments which occur in well-mixed and homogenous ecologies. We were able to quantitively analyze this coexistence because we can look down through the structures into the habitat patches and measure local cell densities, and also measure the cross-correlations between the local strain densities: one can really take apart how the two conflicting strains interact and appear to improve BOTH of their long-term surviving population densities through competition.

From cou.: 26 The aggregations occur both in the control experiments and in the competition experiments, indicating that aggregation is not solely due to competition but is an intrinsic aspect of the strain phenotype. The patterns can be quantified in terms of the size of aggregates and the cell densities within each aggregate. We have done a cluster size analysis between hours 45 and 60 into the run and used the obtained aggregate area 〈A〉 and intensity 〈I〉 couples, 30 in total, to produce a 2D histogram for each of the 85 MHPs. See Fig. 6. The datapoints are color-coded by MHP number, the blue end of the spectrum is the “closed” region, and the red end of the spectrum is the “open” region. Note that the density axis has been normalized to account for the difference in brightness of the fluorescent proteins.

From cou.: 27 The results of the analysis show that the average local patch size of the GASP strains at least in the “open” region are consistently approximately 5 times the area of the wild type strains both in the control experiments and in a competition experiment, while the density of the GASP strain patches are approximately 1/3 of the wild-type strain patches in size. Presumably the patch sizes are larger and less dense in the case of the GASP mutants because they are adapted to poor (conditioned) media of poor quality and continue to divide even in the presence of high stress: spreading out and avoiding high local densities might allow GASP mutants to continue metabolism with less interference from each others' toxins. The opposite is true for the wild-type strain: they self-limit growth and are adapted to fresh medium and we assume that in this case fitness is enhanced by forming small, high density colonies. However, this does not explain the survival of the two strains under competition because the clustering behavior is basically unaffected by a competition experiment. The consequences of competition can be seen most clearly in the correlations between the population densities of the wild-type and GASP densities between the MHPs (inter-MHP), not at the local level within each MHP (intra-MHP). Thus, the scale of conflict and cooperation between wild-type and GASP mutants is a metascale phenomena and not obvious at a local scale. To analyze MHP correlations we computed the Pearson correlation coefficient Cx,y between vector data sets x and y consisting of the fluorescence intensities of the green (x) and red (y) channels averaged within a given MHP Cx,y is given by the expression:

From Soup: 43 Finally, we present some unpublished work which shows how as the length scale of the fitness landscape is shrunk down the dynamics of the metapopulation conflicts also change in response to the length scale, and the resultant changes in cell invasion. The above experiment had a very simple stress landscape at a very coarse scale: no food on one side (half of the ecological patches), plentiful food on the other (the remaining ecological patches). In this world of black and white, the “defectors” and the “cooperators” coexist within each ecology. One can ask, what happens as the length scale of the stress landscape shrinks down to a finer scale? In our case here, we have shrunk the stress landscape to a binary scale: every other patch has food , and is adjacent to a patch with no food . This kind of binary landscape, on and off, closely resembles the frustrated landscape of the spin-glass that we discussed in the Introduction. What happens when “defectors” and ‘cooperators” try to coexist on such a landscape which is highly frustrated on a very small length scale?

From Soup: 44 Fig. 8 presents a stacked set of color images of this binary landscape with initial occupation of equal densities of defector (red) and cooperator (green) bacteria. Here the metapopulations in spatial competition between defectors and cooperators have quite an intricate dance. Initially, the fast growing cooperators (wild-type) grow in the open food patches and not in the restricted food patches. The slower growing defectors, who are adapted to stress and also can metabolize the detritus of lysed cells and act as scavengers, do something interesting: at about 10 h the cooperators change sides: the cooperators move into the opposite channels in quite a synchronous fashion. Cooperators survive. This is vastly different from the behavior in a simple black/white fitness landscape, emphasizing the importance of the topology of the stress landscape, and to be honest the mystery of what the bacteria are doing and how it enhances fitness. Defector strains can either coexist with cooperator strains or they can invade, depending on the stress landscape. Large scale mutations at specific sites occur rapidly and serve to specifically enhance local fitness at the cost of the fitness of other strains. All the ingredients for testing our models are here, all the knowledge we get can be mapped forward to mammalian cells and ecology: it is just a matter of doing clever enough experiments guided by deep underlying principles of biology and, yes, physics.

From Soup: 46 The entire structure is rather large scale, 2 cm across at present. The “galaxy” name comes from the fact that the structure is designed as an interconnected array of micro-ecologies, as can be seen in Fig. 9 , these micro-ecologies are similar to the stars that an astronomical galaxy comprises, and provide the fragmented small populations. Any self respecting spiral galaxy has a black hole, so does ours: at the center of the array is a center chamber used as the injection port for the bacteria. Once the bacteria are injected the port is sealed. Thus, there is no food coming from the center of the device, as the bacteria grow the center of the device will become depleted in media and oxygen and become the highest stress region of the galaxy and the region of largest cell death , hence the name Death Galaxy, and it satisfies the generation of stress gradients. The array is coupled diffusively to external sources of food and toxins by a 10 micron thick PDMS wall which allows diffusive exchange but not convective exchange of chemicals. This diffusive only connection with the external world also generates stress on the microenvironment.

From Soup: 47 Game theory comes into play as we introduce toxins via the external loop. For example, suppose we not only circulate fresh medium in the external loop but also a slowly ramping concentration of a powerful antibiotic such as Cipro, which is known to trigger the SOS response and generate mutation causing genes coding for the gyrase that Cipro binds to gyrases needed for DNA replication . 18 Bacteria now face a dilemma: food is available coming on from the periphery, but it comes at the cost of blockage of cell growth . One possibility is for cells to remain in stationary phase . If the SOS response truly generates mutations in the genes coding for gyrases, and if metabolic stress is connected with this stress induction of mutations, then cells at the center of the galaxy will have the greatest temptation to defect and search for evolutionary work arounds to the dual problem of stress and antibiotic blocking of growth . Should these cells at the center solve the problem, they will be able to explosively grow outwards from the center taking advantage of cells that have died or are in the stationary phase . We believe that the basic layout of the Death Galaxy, based on the physics principles we have laid out, will offer a direct test of how well we understand how at least bacteria evolved most rapidly under stress.

From Soup: 48 We have carried out some preliminary experiments with this complex 2-D stress landscape. Cipro is interesting in that it does not kill cells , it simply stops them from dividing because they no longer can replicate DNA due to the blocked gyrase. Thus, the stress landscape generated by the Cipro gradient creates an interesting incentive for bacteria which can find a mutant gyrase that doesn't bind Cipro: the Cipro region will be full of stalled E. coli and copious food resources, much more than the regions where the Cipro concentration falls below the binding constant for the gyrase.

From Soup: 49 Fig. 10 shows the results of one Cipro run. In this experiment LB broth was pumped around both chambers for 40 h after inoculation of wild-type E. coli . Since the nanoslits provide a very weak coupling of the medium into the large array, the bacteria quickly congregate to the outer perimeters of the array, as is seen in Fig. 10(A) and (B) . The ring of cells propagating outwards from the center seen in Fig. 10(A) is a fairly common occurrence seen in bacterial systems which interact through chemotactic signaling , as we have discussed in earlier work. 19,20 Eventually at about 40 h the bacterial 2-D system has settled down into a stationary phase with most active bacteria at the periphery of the 2-D array ( Fig. 10(B) ).

From Soup: 50 At t = 40 h after inoculation Cipro at 100 nM concentration now flows around the right hand side of the array, as in Fig. 9 . The response of the bacteria to the cessation of growth is clear by +15 h after Cipro flow: the bacteria on the LB broth side begin to migrate against the Cipro gradient into Cipro containing regions ( Fig. 10C ). By +60 h after Cipro flow there is now substantial penetration of the E. coli into normally lethal concentration of Cipro. The next step will be genomic analysis of the bacteria growing in the stress landscape of micro-ecologies as a function of both space and time.

Our technology at this point is mainly centered on creating unusual, highly stressful micro-ecology environments and observing the resulting changes in evolutionary fitness with time through changes in cell densities. This is fairly easy to do with our technology. However, at some point we must correlate genotype with phenotype. We have already discussed our initial gene sequencing work in Fig. 4 . But, we can and must do much better than that. We believe that this review lays down the seeds for that much more powerful analysis correlating phenotype with genomic evolution under stress.

From Soup: 72 We can include a commons tragedy aspect to the problem: the cooperators are not allowed to consume the lysis results of the of bacteria, while the defector bacteria are allowed to consume lysis results and the . On the other hand, the defector bacteria need the conditioning of the medium by the altruists in order to grow rapidly: in that sense the defector bacteria are dependent on the altruists for survival. The defector bacteria can be said to not truly seek a tragedy of the commons, for if they did they would be destroyed as well as their . In this simple designed environment, although we can simulate many aspects of defection which we believe are related to tumor , a truly destructive Nash Equilibrium does NOT occur. where is the number of elements in the data set, in our case = 44 MHPs for the “open” and “closed” landscape elements. The Pearson correlation coefficient varies in value from +1 for perfectly correlated data to −1 for perfectly anticorrelated data, with a value of 0 if the data sets have no correlation at all. presents the results of a Pearson correlation as a function of time for both the open and closed regions, for both the control experiments with red and green WT + WT and red and green + , and competition experiments of green WT + red . Since we are evaluating inter-MHP correlations here, these are long length scale correlations. If the two strains of bacteria simply ignored each other and grew at equal rates, would be +1. In the case of the control experiments, if there was no difference in the phenotype of the GFP (green) and RFP (red) expressing strains, co-culturing the two equivalent strains should result in = 1, which is roughly the case for both the “closed” and “open” regions of the MHP landscape. If there was a mutual exclusion of the WT and mutants in a competition experiment, you would expect to see = −1, this in fact seems to develop in competition experiments but only at times greater than about 40 h, but after that the segregated exclusion of the two strains is almost complete.
