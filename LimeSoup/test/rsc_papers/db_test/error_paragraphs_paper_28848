From cou.: 2 As a consequence of their interesting reactivity and since the discovery of the anticancer action of cis-platin1 the study of square planar platinum complexes has been of great interest. Platinum complexes containing phosphorus ligands are of particular interest as their 31P NMR spectra contain 195Pt satellite peaks which allow the 31P–195Pt coupling constant to be measured giving insight into the nature of bonding around the platinum centre.2 Previous studies have shown in a limited range of compounds that there is a crude correlation between the P–Pt bond length and the 31P–195Pt coupling constant.3–5 Here we report the crystal structures of a series of cis-PtX2(P(OMe)nPh3−n)2 (X = Br or I; n = 0–3) and compare them to their cis-PtCl2(P(OMe)nPh3−n)2 analogues to create a series with coupling constants in the range 3450–5750 Hz and show that the relationship between their 31P–195Pt coupling constant and Pt–P bond length is linear.

From cou.: 9 The 31P–{1H} NMR spectra of all the complexes (Table 1) exhibit singlets together with satellites due to 1JPt–P couplings. For each of the three halides the coupling constant is observed to decrease in the order P(OMe)3 > P(OMe)2Ph > P(OMe)Ph2 > PPh3 (Fig. 1) as the π-acidity of the phosphorus ligands decrease. In addition to this, for each of the four phosphorus ligands the coupling constant decreases in the order Cl > Br > I as the degree of π back-bonding between the platinum and the halide, and hence the halide's ability to compete with the phosphorus for the electron back-donation, increases. This can be interpreted as an increase in trans-influence as the coupling constant is an indication of bond strength and trans-influence is defined as the ability of a ligand to weaken the bond trans to it.14 The chemical shifts are also seen to decrease in the order Cl > Br > I with the exception of the complexes containing P(OMe)3 where the opposite is observed.

From cou.: 10 The X-ray crystal structures of the dibromide complexes (5)–(8) (Fig. 2, Table 2) were determined and refined to a good standard. All of the structures exhibit square planar geometry about the platinum and were observed to be isostructural to their dichloride analogues. The Pt–Br distances lie within the range 2.4696(4) Å to 2.4933(5) Å and exhibit no significant trend. The Pt–P bond lengths are within the range 2.207(2) Å to 2.2685(10) Å and, as was observed in the dichloride analogues, increase in the order P(OMe)3 < P(OMe)2Ph < P(OMe)Ph2 < PPh3. The P(1)–Pt–P(2) and Br(1)–Pt–Br(2) bond angles lie in the ranges 93.74(9)°to 98.41(4)° and 86.000(18)° to 89.265(17)° respectively with no significant trends apparent.

From cou.: 12 Comparing the structures of compounds (1)–(12) it can be seen that for each of the halides the Pt–P bond length is seen to increase in the order P(OMe)3 < P(OMe)2Ph < P(OMe)Ph2 < PPh3 with the PPh3 complexes having Pt–P bond lengths ca. 0.06 Å longer than the P(OMe)3 complexes (Table 2, Fig. 4). For each of the phosphorus ligands the Pt–P bond length increases in the order Cl < Br < I with Pt–P bond lengths in the iodide complexes being ca. 0.03 Å longer than their dichloride equivalents. These two effects are in accord with [1] the π-acidity of the phosphorus ligands increasing as the oxygen content rises and [2] the heavier halogens being better π-acceptors and thus phosphorus trans to iodine is less strongly bound than phosphorus trans to chloride.

From cou.: 41 1
From Soup: 41 We found that as the bond length increases the coupling constant decreases. The correlation between these two measurements in this series of compounds is rather good giving a reasonable straight line that can be fitted by eqn (2) ( Fig. 5 ). We did consider that another way of gauging the s-character and hence the strength of the bond would be to look at the R–P–R, R–P–O and O–P–O bond angles in these complexes with larger values indicating a move towards more ideal sp 3 hybridisation however we did not observe any correlation in this regard.. It thus appears that in a narrow series of complexes the coupling constant could be used as a good indicator of bond length.

From cou.: 42 J
From Soup: 42 To further test the principle we compared Pt–P bond lengths and 1 J Pt–P coupling constants we examined Pt(E 2 N 2 )(PR 3 ) 2 15–21 as well as their protonated equivalents that have been prepared in our and other labs, 18,20–25 corresponding cis - and trans -dihalides 26–48 and Pt(NSO) 2 (PR 3 ) 2 complexes. 49,50 This supports the assertion ( Fig. 6 , Table 5 ) that the larger the coupling constant the shorter the Pt–P bond length. As can be seen in Fig. 6 the correlation is not necessarily linear since at the extremes significant energetic stabilisation is needed in order to influence bond length and the magnitude of coupling constants is a better measure of s orbital overlap than of absolute bond length, however the best fit straight line is given by eqn (3) .

From cou.: 43 J
From Soup: 43 Using eqn (2) and (3) we tested the accuracy of the correlation as an indicator of bond length on a selection of compounds ( Table 6 ). It is interesting to note that in most cases eqn (2) tends to give a more accurate result than eqn (3) the former being on average within 0.015 Å of the observed distance and the latter within 0.02 Å. The accuracy of eqn (3) could potentially be improved with a more extensive literature search.

From cou.: 46 Using eqn (2) and (3) we tested the accuracy of the correlation as an indicator of bond length on a selection of compounds (Table 6). It is interesting to note that in most cases eqn (2) tends to give a more accurate result than eqn (3) the former being on average within 0.015 Å of the observed distance and the latter within 0.02 Å. The accuracy of eqn (3) could potentially be improved with a more extensive literature search.

From Soup: 97 Thus, to a good approximation, the coupling constant is given by where the s-characters of the orbitals is contained in the M.O. bond order between the s-orbitals, ( ′ ) . The valance state s-orbital basis functions are given by the expressions | (0)| and | (0)| , Δ is the average excitation energy and and the magnetogyric constants for each . As is evident the principles involved are complex however for a given phosphorus ligand and metal centre | (0)| and | (0)| should remain relatively constant leaving ( ′ ) as the dominating factor in the magnitude of . Clearly given , provided the nature of the bonding is not dramatically different there should be a good correlation between Pt–P bond length and {Pt–P}.
