From cou.: 1 The implementation of Life Cycle Assessment and related methods in green chemical process and synthesis design strongly supports the development of greener concepts on the basis of deep and profound insights into the dependences between the selection of compounds and process parameters and the resulting environmental impacts. This review article provides an overview on things to know about LCA in general, specifics to be considered during its application in the field of chemical (re-)designs and current application examples from emerging research areas such as active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing, nanotechnology, flow chemistry, process intensification under harsh synthesis conditions, process integration, waste treatment, the use of alternative energy sources or solvents as well as chemistry based on renewable resources.

From cou.: 2 In the last decade, consciousness has risen for the finiteness of resources, and the serious impact of industrialisation on the environment in various ways is no longer denied. Consequences have been envisaged: scientists have started research to understand the coherences of environmental changes with human behaviour, politicians have adopted laws restricting emissions and encouraging resource efficiency, consumers have started asking for more environmentally benign products and industry has to deal with the increasing demand for environmentally benign ways of production.

From cou.: 3 But, how can the environmental impact of a novel chemical process or material design be determined in a quantitative manner right from the start to support sustainable developments? Over the past few decades, the concept of life-cycle thinking has become increasingly important. Consequently, the method of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)1,2 has been developed and is now established as one of the major tools for the analysis of anthropogenic environmental impacts.3 LCA is outstanding in its scope of applicability and its holism. It considers the whole life cycle of a product or process and evaluates environmental impacts in terms of various environmental impact categories that go beyond the consideration of mass or energy flows.

From cou.: 4 LCA was developed in the early seventies and has since then been refined and supported with inventory databases and impact assessment methodologies. Today, it can be applied to very complex issues. Aiming to compare the eco-friendliness of products and processes, LCA is nowadays an integral part of decision-making in industry and governmental and non-governmental organisations. LCA can be used as a standalone tool or in combination with other environmental, risk, economic or social assessment tools, see also the reports by Jacquemin et al.3 or Guinée et al.4 and the references therein.

From cou.: 6 As the name ‘Life Cycle Assessment’ implies, the perspective of LCA is the entire life of the product or process under investigation (see Fig. 1). This means that all the mass- and energy-flows within the life of a product are recorded, from the acquisition of the raw material, over the distribution and the use, to the final deposition of the wastes after its use (also called “cradle-to-grave”).5

From cou.: 7 The defined structure of LCA studies consists of the following stages: (i) Goal and Scope Definition, (ii) Life Cycle Inventory Analysis (LCI), (iii) Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA), and (iv) Life Cycle Interpretation. LCA is usually an iterative process. While working at one of the stages, difficulties in the acquisition of data might appear or new information may give rise to a necessary change in the settings made previously. Thus, it is often useful and necessary to go back to earlier stages and change these settings.5

From cou.: 8 During Goal and Scope Definition, the cornerstones of the study are defined. The precise determination of the intention of the study is important to establish a basis for decisions that have to be made during the execution of the study. It includes the motivation, the audience addressed and the purpose of the study. The definition of the scope also includes the phrasing of certain rules concerning the methodological procedure of the study. Here, the investigated chemical product or process is also set in terms of a functional unit as a comparable performance characteristic. All inputs and outputs are assigned to this functional unit.

From cou.: 9 The second step of the LCA is inventory analysis. During Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) all the mass and energy flows within the scope of the study are recorded. Focus is placed on the structuring of the entire life cycle in separate unit processes as well as on the collection and calculation of data. Data collection means the assembly of all (energy and material) inputs (resources extracted from the environment) and outputs (products, wastes, emissions). Data calculation includes the validation and the relation of the data to the functional unit. At this, the LCI database ecoinvent6 is often used in the case of missing measured or gathered data, especially with regard to up- and downstream processes of the chemical synthesis under investigation. Provided by the ecoinvent Centre, the database includes the most consistent, transparent, and up-to-date Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data worldwide. Within the several thousands of LCI datasets, relevant LCI data concerning not only bulk and speciality chemicals, but also energy supply, transport, biofuels and biomaterials, construction and packaging materials, basic and precious metals, metals processing, as well as waste treatment can be found based on industrial data.

From cou.: 10 In the case of a process involving more than one commercially useful product as well as recycled materials, an allocation of the energy and material flows has to be applied.5 In general, various allocation methods are present and are controversially discussed.7–9 Two of the more common allocation procedures refer to the mass or market-value of these products (see Fig. 2).

 ###### 
From cou.: 11 The Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) is conducted with the results of LCI. Certain potential environmental consequences (namely ‘impact categories’) are assigned to the mass- and energy-flows according to the chosen characterisation model. This way, the LCIA leads to statements about the environmental performance of the process, and the particular process step or product under investigation. There exist many different ways of assigning environmental impacts to the inventory, but they all follow a common procedure fixed in the standards EN ISO 140405 and 140445: (i) selection of a characterisation model, (ii) classification, (iii) characterisation, and optional, (iv) normalisation.

 ###### 
From cou.: 12 The impact categories are selected according to the goal and scope of the study. The category indicator is the quantifiable representation of a certain impact category. The category indicator and the characterisation model are developed according to the environmental mechanism that is known for the particular impact category. The potential environmental impacts of the elementary flows that are identified in the LCI are classified within these impact categories. During characterisation, the potential impact of an inventoried item is quantified in terms of a representative unit, e.g., in carbon dioxide equivalents in the case of emissions causing climate change. The normalisation step is the calculation of the characteristic value of the category indicator relative to a reference value, e.g., in relation to an emission limit or per capita. The normalisation step is optional and does not have to be included in the LCIA.5

From cou.: 13 Nowadays, a number of LCIA methods have been established. They all use different kinds of characterisation models and therefore consist of different impact categories. The inclusion of these LCIA methods in software tools commonly used for LCA enables the LCA practitioner to focus on the data for the LCI, but the choice of the LCIA method and the considered impact categories must be well conceived with respect to the goal and scope of the study.10

 ###### 
From cou.: 14 There are two different kinds of impact categories, the input- and the output-related categories. The theoretical model behind an input-related category could be described as follows: if the elementary flow is the extraction of 1 kg mineral oil, the effect (and the indicator) will be the depletion of a particular share of the remaining fossil oil resources. In order to define the impact of this depletion the scarcity, the renewability and the availability of a resource have to be considered. Therefore the evaluation of input-related indicators is already a complex issue.11 The output-related categories are even more difficult to quantify, because the effects of the outputs are more multi-layered. There are primary, secondary and tertiary (and even more) effects of an output that can all serve for the indication of the characterisation. For the impact category of Climate Change (CC) the effect chain could be described as follows:

 ###### 
From cou.: 18 This list can be continued with further possible effects such as changes in abiotic conditions, effects on living nature and eventually, effects on human health. If the indicator of a certain impact category is close to the inventory (close to the emission), it is called a midpoint indicator. If the indicator is describing a tertiary effect, it is called an endpoint indicator. As shown in Fig. 3, the indication of the effects becomes more complex due to the chain of events between cause and effect. Tertiary effects and beyond are difficult to measure and the number of impact categories rises, since the emission of one substance often has multiple effects (for example considering different areas of protection). Still, the use of endpoint categories would describe the actual impacts that the areas of protection are affected by, rather than the changes of the environment that result in potential effects. Therefore, the implementation of endpoint categories is one of the major goals of the current progress of LCA methodology, but cannot be recommended without objections yet.12

From cou.: 19 The characterisation model, which is the foundation of the association of the LCI results with the LCIA results, is based on confirmed scientific insight. Still, the resulting impacts should not be interpreted as verified predictions. Often, the environmental mechanism is complex and the theoretical models do not include spatial or temporal dimensions.13 The assessment of impacts is always a balancing act between scientific precision and feasibility. Therefore the results of the LCIA are afflicted with uncertainties (that are often not defined, yet) and should be seen as statements on the potential impacts.

From cou.: 21 For the association of the inventory data with potential environmental impacts it is useful to choose one consistent LCIA method, which is a collection of characterisation models concerning a variety of impact categories. The choice of LCIA methods and their underlying characterisation models determined by standardisation organisations should be based on an international approval or agreement.5 There are a number of LCIA methods existing, partly still in the developmental stage. A comprehensive overview about these methods is given by Hauschild and colleagues.11 Some of the well-established ones are for example CML 2002,14 IMPACT 200215 (both midpoint oriented methods) or Eco-Indicator 9916 (endpoint oriented indicator).

From Soup: 53 The term a x describes the power of the substance x to increase the radiative forcing and the term x ( t ) describes the lifetime of the gas, as the gases in the atmosphere are subjected to different kinds of effects that influence their concentrations, like chemical reactions with other gases or degradation caused for example by UV-radiation. As can be seen from the equation, the quality that is used to describe the CC is the increase of radiative forcing caused by a greenhouse gas relative to a reference gas. In this case, the reference gas is CO 2 , the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. 18 The direct relative radiative forcing per ppbv (part per billion, volume basis) is derived from infrared radiative transfer models based on laboratory measurements of the molecular properties of each substance and considering the molecular weights. 10 Originating from the IPCC, the characterisation model is consensus-based and undisputed. It is classified satisfactory and recommended by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC). Table 1 gives an overview of the characterisation model for CC. Since most production processes are connected with a significant energy demand causing additional environmental impacts, the Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) was established as a LCIA category nearly twenty years ago. 19,20

From Soup: 61 The identification of significant results is mainly achieved by structuring the results of the LCI and LCIA. The evaluation is concerned with the completeness of the data base, the consistency of the data (data quality indication) and the analysis of the sensitivity of the results for changes in data. Having checked for these criteria, conclusions can be drawn concerning the resulting recommendations but also the limitations of the LCA study.

From Soup: 62 Most data used in a typical LCA study come from secondary sources such as LCA databases, process simulation tools, information from similar processes, literature references, etc. Due to this fact as well as the inhomogeneity of those collected data, a distinct uncertainty is inherent.

From Soup: 63 Furthermore, unclear definitions, the cut-off of relevant up- and downstream processes, the choice of unsuited environmental impacts, and incorrect interpretations, e.g. , caused by overdone aggregation, or the combination of data from different temporal or geographic origin may affect the overall LCA, thus weakening the powerful validity and reliability of life cycle analyses compared to simple green metrics. It is the responsibility of each evaluator to reduce these causes for uncertainty carefully without losing sight of practicability and to document the quality of the data used. One approach to reduce the data gathering effort is sensitivity analysis based on expert knowledge. As an example, a variation of the typical synthesis or process parameters and the analysis of the resulting effect on the overall environmental balance support the selection of most influencing process modules. 29,30 In the next step, those process modules can be evaluated in more detail than others showing only a minor contribution.

From Soup: 64 Monte Carlo simulations can further help to determine whether the calculated differences between alternatives evaluated within a comparative LCA are significant.

From Soup: 65 The description of the experimental procedures within a scientific study for greener chemical process and product design is mostly precise and comprehensive and the data quality goals can be achieved. The availability of secondary data is typically lower and therefore quality goals can only be accomplished partially. Hence, the quality of the data varies depending on the available sources within the specific study. In order to take these variations into account, the data quality of each aspect of this study should be indicated via indicators. A common procedure to indicate the data quality in an LCA is the so-called ‘Pedigree Matrix’ which has been established for this purpose by Weidema. 33 The data quality indicators used by Weidema are:

From Soup: 72 One major difference between Weidema's established valuation system and the one introduced here is the aggregation of the indicators for time, space and technological correspondence into one indicator called representativeness. Weidema reasons that the division is useful in order to figure out areas for improvement more easily. Nevertheless, in the early stages of chemical process or synthesis design the simplification suggested herewith has been found useful for purposes of clarity, and last but not least, due to typically limited information about the time, space and technological implications of the novel process or material under development in a future industrial environment. The indicator score is always guided by the single aspect that scores the worst. If, for example the time-correlation scores ‘1’ and the technological correlation scores ‘5’ or is unknown, the score for representativeness is ‘5’.

From Soup: 79 As mentioned before, the LCA method is not specially designed for the evaluation of chemical processes or its application for decision-making purposes during process design (for more detailed information see ref. 34 ).

From Soup: 80 The benefits of applying LCA for the evaluation of green chemical processes and products, syntheses pathways and technologies have been stated above. The results of an LCA study can be used to highlight the attractiveness of a novel production pathway; they can help make decisions on which chemical compound to use or it can show optimisation potentials within an existing procedure. 41 The most beneficial way of employing LCA is to apply it in the early development of new compounds or procedures. In this stage, relevant weak points can not only be fixed by after care or so-called end-of-pipe solutions, but they can also be identified and avoided in advance. 42 However, the complexity and the time and effort needed to conduct an LCA study are often the reasons to prefer other, less complicated ways of evaluation at this stage. This is especially the case when new, non-established developments with little available data are to be assessed. In order to enable LCA in such cases without neglecting its high life-cycle based standards, there are different ways to decrease the amount of work and data requirements that come along with.

From Soup: 81 In an attempt to enable an LCA with smaller scope, the Society of Environmental Chemistry and Toxicology (SETAC) developed a framework for Simplified Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA) 43 (also called Streamlined LCA), which describes the possibilities of simplification for every phase of the LCA.

From Soup: 86 Another possibility to decrease the amount of work afflicted with LCA is to concentrate on the most relevant life cycle stages: some LCA studies are not concerned with the entire life cycle of a product, but with the potential impacts that are caused by a particular life stage (gate-to-gate analysis). More often, a cradle-to-gate assessment is performed, including all life cycle impacts caused up to the production and work-up of the final chemical compound. It is used for comparative studies evaluating different processing alternatives or synthesis pathways resulting in the same product, characterised by a comparable product quality. The further life-cycle impacts of all alternatives considered are equal and therefore excluded.

From Soup: 87 Another simplification approach was followed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). They developed the FLASC™ software tool 45 for fast LCA in synthetic chemistry especially for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API). Material classes were chosen where it was possible to generate average LCI profile data that could be used for materials where LCI data did not exist. Then, a methodology to predict the cradle-to-gate life cycle impact profile for a typical batch chemical process used to synthesise APIs was developed based on the LCI of the materials used in the process, using a combination of actual or average data, and the mass of the material. Based on a core set of life cycle impact profiles for well-developed GSK processes including separation and/or isolation steps, a series of formulae was developed that enabled a score to be calculated for different impact categories. The average FLASC™ score was finally calculated from the individual scores for each impact category. The FLASC™ tool is now used to determine, compare and benchmark the ‘greenness’ or relative sustainability of synthetic processes in order to facilitate more informed and sustainable business choices. The motivation for the development of this tool was again the particular high optimisation potential at an early stage in research and development (R&D) activities when route and processes are being selected and detailed environmental data are not available.

From Soup: 88 Since sustainability is not only characterised by environmental but also by cost and societal criteria, LCA investigations are often coupled with other evaluation tools. As an example, every investment decision in green chemical processes and technologies is finally a cost-based decision. Therefore, the life-cycle based assessment can be extended by the economic dimension of sustainability using appropriate cost assessment tools such as Life Cycle Costing (LCC). 46 The results of both, plotted in two-dimensional graphs, can show the effectiveness of certain measures in environmental as well as in economic terms. 47 Additionally, combined with the results of a Societal LCA, 48 all aspects of sustainability can be covered in a methodologically profound approach.

From Soup: 92 As mentioned before, the analysis and minimisation of future environmental impact potentials of a novel chemical process under development is most effective during early stages. This effect is contradictory to the profound data requirements of an LCA study, which usually can not be fulfilled (if no experiences with a similar process are on hand), until the process is implemented on the industrial scale. Here, process simulation tools such as ASPEN Tech and HYSYS are very helpful to estimate the mass and energy balance of the process and its optimisation potentials on the future production scale as a data basis for the LCI stage (also called ex-ante LCA). 52,53

From Soup: 93 From the complexity of the LCIA on the one hand and the combination of the LCA with other evaluation methods described before on the other hand it becomes obvious that several, partly contradictory objectives are incorporated in a sustainable process or product design and evaluation process. Then, a multi-objective decision making problem occurs, especially in the case of conflicting objectives (see Fig. 5 ). The problem of comparing several alternatives with respect to several objectives, e.g. , costs, environmental or social impact and risks, integrating also a Multi-Objective Optimisation (MOO) can be solved by Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques are gaining popularity in sustainable process management to find a good trade-off among various objectives, often considering economic, safety or ecological aspects in parallel.

From Soup: 98 In order to define a preference relation of multi-attributed alternatives, the outranking methods mentioned before can be applied. As a result of a total or partial outranking procedure regarding several LCIA results, preferences for specific, pareto-optimal options for environmental efficiency can be quantified. At this, the environmental efficiency can be determined based on the relative saving potentials in different LCIA categories referred to as the worst as well as the best case candidates (highest or lowest environmental impact potential, respectively) calculated in each of these categories. Finally, one aggregated environmental efficiency value can be calculated by means of weighting factors. 72,73 Furthermore, the results are transferable to, e.g. , a bi-objective eco-portfolio depiction showing environmental and cost efficiency in one graph. Thereby, cost efficiency is typically calculated taking into account relevant variable and fixed production cost criteria, e.g. , investment, material, energy, personnel, and waste treatment costs. High efficiency values in both categories place attention on preferential options.

In consequence, this results in a higher ranking score and thus in a preference against the other process alternatives.

From Soup: 106 Van Kalkeren et al. 77 examined catalytic Appel and Wittig reactions, which were developed to avoid phosphine oxide waste produced in the classic phosphorus-consuming process alternatives ( Fig. 10 ). They conducted an LCA study, in which the conventional reactions were compared with their catalytic counterparts in terms of CED and GWP. By means of this, they aimed to answer the question whether the requisite stoichiometric amounts of silanes may hinder environmental improvements.

From Soup: 108 Griffiths and colleagues applied the LCA tool to measure the performance of a range of iron and palladium based nanoparticle catalysts for carbon dioxide utilisation on the laboratory scale. 78 The catalysts combined the reverse water gas shift reaction with the Fischer–Tropsch process to convert CO 2 into hydrocarbons used as fuels and feedstocks for the chemical industry. The LCA results afforded insight into ‘green’ catalyst design, since palladium addition vastly improves catalyst performance. However, they also found scenarios in which the continual addition of palladium, although showing favourable CO 2 conversion and hydrocarbon yields, does not return a sufficient environmental offset to cover the embodied impacts present in its generation.

Furthermore, 3-pentenamide, i.e. , the precursor used in the novel catalytic process could be made from bio-based, instead of petrochemical butadiene, which would further reduce the environmental impacts.

From Soup: 112 Due to its use as a monomer precursor for nylon 6,6 production, adipic acid is the most important dicarboxylic acid, 81 featuring a worldwide annual production of 2.6 million tons. 82 Wang et al . 83 discussed potential environmental benefits resulting from a simplification of the adipic acid (ADA) synthesis ( Scheme 1 ). The conventional process for ADA synthesis takes two steps, oxidation of cyclohexane by air followed by nitration oxidation. This process is characterised by capital- and energy-intensive downstream processes as well as an NO x emission problem. In contrast, the direct route starts from cyclohexene and uses hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. Whereas the direct synthesis suffered in a batch process protocol from a long reaction time and increased safety issues, these drawbacks were overcome by micro-flow processing. The reaction rate of the two-phase reaction of cyclohexene oxidation by H 2 O 2 was increased by an improved mass transfer and a higher temperature. By means of a comparative LCA using the CML 2002 LCIA methodology, the authors could demonstrate that the direct micro-flow route has advantages for the environment as well, but also disadvantages for impact categories such as Land Use, Human Toxicity Potential (HTP) or CED compared to the conventional route. This was reasoned by the high environmental burden of hydrogen peroxide supply.

Savings in environmental impacts could be obtained for the laboratory scale syntheses as well as for the newly implemented industrial scale process. On the laboratory scale, the advantages mainly consisted of savings in energy consumption, a reduction of the solvent amount and the increase of the reaction yield achieved by the micro-scale setup. On the industrial scale, the avoidance of a cryogenic system by increasing the reaction temperature was the most important benefit. Compared to these saving potentials (being in the range of 10–40% depending on the environmental impact category investigated), the fabrication of the reactors and of the peripheral equipment played a minor role.

From Soup: 139 The performance of the micromixing structures was significantly influenced by the process parameters chosen, especially by the utilisation of ionic liquids such as [C 18 MIM]Br, [MIM][BuSO 3 ] or [BMIM]Br as phase transfer catalysts. The ionic liquids showed strongly positive results on the yield of the esterification reaction compared to non-catalysed syntheses. Despite the high environmental burden of these compounds resulting from their material and energy demanding synthesis, the overall environmental balance was improved even when the ionic liquids were used only once without recycling. Sensitivity analyses were performed by varying relevant process parameters including the amount of solvent, the yield and flow rates. Based on this, the work-up step was found to be a major bottleneck for the green process design, independently from the decision for batch or flow processing. Another critical element was the higher energy demand of the flow processing plant including pumps and process control systems compared to the batch system. As a result, substantial savings up to 70% for the microreaction process were forecasted only under the constraint that the high electricity demand of the peripheral equipment can be reduced in an optimised production process.

From Soup: 141 Some years ago, Hessel introduced the concept of Novel Process Windows (NPW) in flow chemistry using microreaction technology. 105 He argued that these smart devices allow the exploitation and intensification of chemistry under harsh process conditions. In the meantime, a broad range of experimental investigations in this area has been performed. 106 Some of them were accompanied by comparative LCA studies in order to answer the question, whether NPW conditions will also result in a more environmentally efficient processing.

Process design alternatives and several solvent concepts were critically compared by means of a Simplified LCA in order to develop a green process ( Fig. 14 ). 30 In addition, the application of microwave irradiation instead of oil bath heating was tested in order to increase the energy efficiency of the process. As active media, hydrogen carbonate containing water or ionic liquids, supercritical CO 2 as well as Dimcarb, a liquid dimethylamine : CO 2 (1.8 : 1) adduct, were investigated under different reaction conditions ( e.g. , temperature, pressure, concentration and molar ratio).

From Soup: 145 The design accompanying a Simplified LCA using the LCIA methods CML 2002 and CED pointed out several hot spots for process design improvements compared to the reference, a batch process utilising aqueous KHCO 3 at a reaction temperature of 100 °C under normal pressure. The application of supercritical carbon dioxide had an adverse impact on the reaction performance, but aqueous [EMIM][HCO 3 ] or [BMIM][HCO 3 ] led to significantly increased yields. Nevertheless, a greener process using these active solvents can only be realised in combination with an efficient recycling of these compounds. 108 The authors explained this outcome with the high environmental impacts caused by the supply chain of the ionic liquids. All in all, the evaluation pointed out that the environmental balance of the Kolbe–Schmitt synthesis benefits from efficient work-up strategies and the utilisation of recyclable ionic liquids as active solvents rather than from harsh synthesis conditions or alternative forms of energy supply.

From Soup: 147 Kralisch and colleagues performed a process design accompanying LCA and the LCC study analysing the NPW concept for the re-design of an existing production process of epoxidised soybean oil. 29 Based on experimental data and process simulation results for syntheses under high temperature ( T > 150 °C) conditions, an environmental screening to identify the best suited flow process conditions was done in a first attempt. In contrast to the last two examples, a real case industrial production of epoxidised soybean oil was used as a benchmark. The results showed that the expected innovations by microreaction technology and chemical intensification under NPW conditions depended on the fluid–fluid and fluid–wall interactions, which were mostly unknown factors when starting the investigations. Thus, the hydrogen peroxide demand was found to be a critical factor, if solid–liquid interactions with the large internal steel surfaces of the microchannels lead to considerably enhanced decomposition rates. Consequently, the LCA results pointed out that this aspect was one of the key criteria for the success of the whole flow process design. Nevertheless, parameter configurations were found, which allow for an improvement of the overall environmental balance compared to the industrial reference fed-batch process. However, due to the dominance of the upstream process of agricultural soybean oil generation in the overall environmental impact of the process, the optimisation potential was estimated to be 5–16% maximum depending on the environmental impact categories considered, again applying the CML 2002 method. Such information, gathered at an early stage of the process design, can be of great value for further decision making. In the specific case described here, the company decided against an investigation into the new technology.

From Soup: 150 Three LCA studies were performed evaluating this topic in detail. In all cases, the same LCIA method, namely CML 2002, was used. This allows a good comparability of the results and provides the opportunity to build upon each other. At first, Morais et al. reported about the potential environmental impacts of different process design alternatives for biodiesel production from waste vegetable oils. 109 The process design alternatives considered in this study included an alkali-catalysed process with a free fatty acid pre-treatment, an acid-catalysed process and a supercritical methanol process using propane as co-solvent. These processes were simulated using the process simulator ASPEN Plus®. The outcome of the study already proposed a supercritical processing of waste oil, using methanol as well as propane as co-solvents. The authors argued that although the supercritical methanol process is highly energy intensive, the downstream operation of methanol recovery and the product purification are much simpler, enabling a decrease in the overall energy consumption compared to the process alternatives with moderate reaction temperatures below 100 °C and normal pressure. An LCA study of Sawangkeaw and colleagues, 110 again supported by process simulation, confirmed that supercritical processing under high temperature conditions of 400 °C can be beneficial also in the case of fresh vegetable oil (here: palm oil).

The development of the novel biodiesel production alternative was accompanied by process simulation, LCA, cost and risk analyses nearly from the beginning using an iterative evaluation procedure. They pointed out favorable process parameter combinations in parallel to experimental optimisation. The transesterification of waste oil via supercritical processing at a temperature of 380 °C and a pressure of 200 bar in intensifying continuous flow reactors was found to be the most favourable option out of eighteen and was transferred to a newly developed mini-plant design. It allows a reduction of the overall GWP up to 70% referred to the industrial established benchmark, utilising fresh vegetable oil under moderate process conditions, as well as a safe processing despite supercritical process conditions.

From Soup: 154 Recently, Patel et al. presented an early-stage sustainability assessment framework to analyse new bio-based process alternatives. 112 The assessment relied on a multi-criteria approach, integrating the performance of chemical conversions based on five indicators into an index value. The indicators encompassed economics, environmental impact, hazards and risks, techno-economics and LCA. For each bio-based process, two R&D stages (current laboratory and expected future) were assessed against a comparable conventional process. The multi-criteria assessment in combination with an uncertainty and scenario analysis showed that the chemical production processes using biomass as a feedstock can provide potential sustainability benefits over conventional alternatives, but requires further development, especially in the case of biomass gasification and pyrolysis processes for fuel production.

From Soup: 156 They argued that with a classical LCA approach, changes in process configuration or design conditions, effects of process integration, future installation size and technology evolution are often not considered or cannot be evaluated. Thus, typically only a few scenarios based on average technologies are discussed. The results of the study showed a non-correspondence of the thermodynamic optimum with the environmental optima, determined by means of the Eco-Indicator 99 16 method ( Fig. 15 ). The energy service substitution and therefore the increase in energy efficiency were key points for the reduction of environmental impacts, especially in the case of a process producing multiple energy services. The results of the multi-objective optimisation further highlighted the importance of the impact caused by logistics, auxiliary materials and off-site emissions associated with the process operation which are usually not accounted in a process design considering only thermo-economic objectives.

From Soup: 157 The optimal design and operation of a hydrocarbon bio-refinery via fast pyrolysis, hydrotreating and hydrocracking for crude bio-oil production was investigated by Gebreslassie and colleagues. 64 The authors applied a model that seeks to maximise the economic performance measured by the net present value (NPV) and to minimise the environmental impacts, described by means of the LCIA category GWP in a gate-to-gate analysis. The Pareto curve in Fig. 16 shows the optimal trade-off of several designs of the hydrocarbon bio-refinery. Each Pareto point represents an optimal design strategy for the hydro-carbon bio-refinery with a trade-off between the economic and environmental criteria NPV and GWP. As shown in Fig. 16 , relative to the maximum NPV design (point C), the global GWP can be reduced to 63% at the expense of decreasing the NPV by 43%. In the other direction, the NPV is increased if GWP is increased as well. At the trade-off point B, the best compromise between these contradictory objectives was found. The study was complemented by an extended model of the bio-refinery including a number of major processing stages, such as drying of the cellulosic biomass feedstocks, the air separation unit, gasification, syngas conditioning, the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, hydroprocessing, power generation, and diesel and gasoline production. 68

Process emissions from the pharmaceutical manufacturing plant itself were less of a concern. The LCIA results found by applying several LCIA methods such as CED, GWP, Eco-Indicator 99, UBP-97 and ReCiPe in parallel are in line with the considerable efforts required for the complex synthesis and the complexity of the pharmaceutical production, as compared to a basic chemical production. Thus, a difference of up to, and sometimes over, two orders of magnitude between basic chemical and pharmaceutical production impacts was forecasted based on the results of this study. The difference was explained by the greater complexity of API molecules, the higher demands of the complex synthesis processes, and the shorter development times of APIs, allowing less time for optimisation of the processes.

The synthetic routes of the reactants, the process energy inputs, the equipment infrastructure and the resulting emissions were considered to determine the environmental impacts of the MWNTs. The results clearly show the high impact of the energy demand for furnace electricity in the process as well as that the infrastructure required at today's state of development causes high environmental impacts. Thus, the excellent performance of MWNTs in application as well as a significant increase in the overall processing efficiency during the scale-up of the MWNT generation are required in order to justify their application compared to alternative materials.

But, due to the unknown nature of carbon emissions from the pyrolysis process, they decided to compare the production methods not by means of typical LCIA categories, but by calculating the embodied energy (the total of all direct and indirect energy inputs) of alternative fullerene production pathways. The results point out that the embodied energy mainly depends on how the carbon precursor is transformed into the desired fullerenes. Four synthesis methods were analysed: pyrolysis with either tetralin (1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene) or toluene as a feedstock and radio frequency or arc plasma with graphite as a feedstock. The resulting carbon emissions depended on the specific process conditions, in particular from the temperature profile in the reactor, the precursor used, and the amount of oxygen. The pyrolysis of 1,4-tetrahydronaphthalene revealed itself to be the method with the lowest embodied energy (12.7 GJ kg −1 C60). Furthermore, the pyrolysis methods investigated had a much lower energy impact than the plasma methods by nearly one order of magnitude due to the lower amount of electricity required. Depending on the necessary purification level, the embodied energy for separation was found to additionally increased by at least a factor of 5 for high purity fullerenes (>98% by wt). In conclusion, the life-cycle based study provided valuable hints concerning key factors for improvement of this energy-intensive process, although no established LCIA indicators were used.

From Soup: 175 Walser et al. 122 performed a cradle-to-grave LCA of the production of nanosilver, its application on textiles (T-shirts) via flame spray pyrolysis and plasma polymerisation with silver co-sputtering, the use phase (including 100 washings) and final disposal, considering the LCIA categories GWP, FETP and METP. The results in this study show significant differences in the environmental burdens between different nanoparticle production technologies: whereas the cradle-to-gate assessment of producing nano-enabled T-shirts by flame spray pyrolysis causes 2.70 kg of CO 2 -equiv., the method of plasma sputtering resulted in 7.67–166 kg of CO 2 -equivalents. In contrast, the production of conventional T-shirts with and without a finishing with the biocide triclosan resulted in emissions of 2.55 kg of CO 2 -equivalents, whereas the share of triclosan in the resulting environmental impact was marginal. Nevertheless, the use phase of the nanosilver T-shirts, identified as the most relevant life cycle stage, can decrease the GWP as compared to conventional (with and without biocidal treatment) clothing, depending on the consumer behaviour: an increased awareness of its biocidal functionality and benefits, and a subsequent change of washing procedures ( e.g. , changing frequency). Thus, higher environmental impacts during the nanoparticle production must not result a priori in a more environmental problematic alternative. Furthermore, the authors described that data on workplace exposure or chronic inhalation toxicity of silver nanoparticles and accompanied potential nano-specific effects are rather scarce. They stated that the development of LCA methodologies for nanomaterials requires the specific assessment of toxic impacts of nanomaterial emissions in the environmental compartments (within all life cycle stages) and suitable metrics for LCI and LCIA ( i.e. , quantification of output, assessment of its impact) to facilitate the performance of a nanomaterial focused LCA, 122 also reported in, e.g. , ref. 118, 119 and 123 .

From Soup: 177 Hischier et al. further pointed out that in many case studies the use phase of engineered nanomaterials is claimed as the “stationary phase”, i.e. , having no influence on the material or energy consumption in this stage. 118 Though, these life cycle stages can have a significant effect on the overall environmental performance as shown above. As an example, Hischier et al. compared the difference in the CED value of carbon nanofibers, polypropylene and steel during material production, composite production and use phase in cars, thus performing a comparison based on functionality issues. The data basis were life cycle studies performed by Khanna and his co-workers, dealing with the life cycle energy consumption and environmental impact from carbon nanofiber and carbon nanofiber composites production as a possible replacement for steel in automobile body panels. 124,125 From a material and composite production point of view, the LCA results indicated (partially significantly) higher life cycle energy intensities and environmental impacts of carbon nanofibers compared to conventional materials such as aluminium and steel. This assessment was based on a kilogram scale (see Fig. 20 ). 124 However, by substituting steel by nanocomposite materials in the automobile body panels, the environmental burdens resulting from upstream processes can be significantly reduced due to, e.g. , weight reduction, and thus reduced fossil energy consumption. 125

By comparing these techniques with conventional anaerobic treatment they found out that by applying electrolysis cells environmental efficiency could be significantly increased, not the least due to the formation of hydrogen peroxide as a valuable by-product in a cost-effective way. 129

In addition, the impact assessment methods need to be extended by further human and ecosystem health indicators to avoid problem shifting. Specific materials such as pathogens, pharmaceuticals or nanomaterials have not been integrated in databases yet. Thus, LCA methodologies need to be adapted to these new compounds, and ideally combined with tools like chemical and microbial risk analyses to provide a holistic analysis and decision-making for stakeholders in this sector. 126,132

From Soup: 186 Depending on the specific questions to be answered by the analysis, different life-cycle approaches (ranging from gate-to-gate to cradle-to-crave) and impact assessment methods were applied. Independent of the LCA software tool, the ecoinvent database 6 was used in most case studies to model LCI data of up- and downstream processes caused by the chemical synthesis under investigation. CML 2002 was found to be the most preferential LCIA method among the users in green chemical process design, whereas the follow-up method ReCiPe was applied so far only in a few studies. The use of this method in future studies is highly recommended (in combination with the latest ecoinvent dataset) in order to improve the actuality, comparability and consistency of LCA studies. The assessment of energy-intensive chemical processes further strongly benefits from the consideration of energy-related impact categories such as CEENE.

LCIA assessment has to be extended by impact factors for a wider range of chemical and pharmaceutical compounds.

Thus, standardised methods for data gap or uncertainty handling as well as common rules for sensitivity analyses are urgently required. Those measures would significantly improve the comparability and reliability of the wide range of studies dealing with chemical product or process design and implementation.
