From cou.: 1 The sedimentation of an initially inhomogeneous distribution of hard-sphere colloids confined in a slit is simulated using the multi-particle collision dynamics scheme which takes into account hydrodynamic interactions mediated by the solvent. This system is an example for soft matter driven out of equilibrium where various length and time scales are involved. The initial laterally homogeneous density profiles exhibit a hydrodynamic Rayleigh–Taylor-like instability. Solvent backflow effects lead to an intricate non-linear behaviour which is analyzed via the solvent flow field and the colloidal velocity correlation function. Our simulation data are in good agreement with real-space microscopy experiments.

From cou.: 2 Mesoscopic colloidal dispersions embedded in a molecular solvent are soft matter systems which need multiscale modelling. For structural equilibrium correlations, this is mainly a problem of different length scales which has been widely addressed and is by now well-understood, e.g. by using the concept of effective interactions.1 For dynamical correlations and non-equilibrium situations, widely different time scales require careful multiscale modelling. The dynamics of a molecular solvent takes place on the picosecond level, while the time a colloid needs to diffuse over its own radius, is in the second time scale for micron-sized colloids. The hydrodynamic interactions2 between the colloidal particles are mediated by the solvent flow on an intermediate time scale and are long-ranged and of many-body nature. It is only at very low colloidal volume fractions that hydrodynamic interactions can be neglected. Recently, various computational schemes have been developed to tackle hydrodynamic interactions ranging from the lattice Boltzmann technique,3 fluidized particle methods4 to multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD)5–7 where the solvent flow is modelled as ideal gas particles which exchange momentum locally by stochastic rotation of the relative velocities.

From cou.: 4 The motion of a colloid is characterised by the Peclet number Pe = τD/τS, which is the ratio between the time τD it takes a particle to diffuse its own radius and the time τS it takes to sediment the same distance. A Peclet number of order unity is the dividing line between colloidal (Pe ≤ 1) and granular systems (Pe ≫ 1), i.e.Pe measures the importance of Brownian motion. The classical Rayleigh–Taylor instability, which occurs if a heavy, immiscible fluid layer is placed on top of a lighter one has been intensively studied for the case of a simple Newtonian fluid both by theory,8 simulation9 and experiment, and is observed in granular matter,10–12 in surface-tension dominated colloid–polymer mixtures13 and in a suspension of dielectric particles exposed to an ac electric field gradient.14 However, except for ref. 15, this instability was never simulated on the particle scale in the context of colloidal sedimentation in confinement including hydrodynamic interactions. Here we present simulation data using the MPCD method. The instability is resolved on the colloidal particle scale and good agreement with real-space experiments is observed. We further show that the instability is accompanied by significant solvent backflow effects. Finally, correlations of the colloidal velocities are calculated which reveal strong lateral correlations and anticorrelations which are time-dependent.

From cou.: 7 The first term on the right hand side is the constant driving force of strength FS directed perpendicular to the walls in the x-direction and the second one represents the force due to the interaction with other colloids (Rij = |Ri − Rj| is the interparticle distance). The third term is a repulsive wall–colloid force. To avoid overlap the colloids interact via a screened Coulomb potential which diverges at Rij = σ, here the reduced inverse screening length is κσ = 40. A similar potential is used for the colloid–wall interaction. We integrate the equation of motion using a velocity Verlet algorithm with a time step δt. Simultaneously, the solvent particles with space position ri and velocity vi move ballistically also within the same time step δt, i.e.

From cou.: 8 To enforce no-slip boundary conditions on the colloid surface a stochastic reflection method16,17 is applied.

Then the new velocity of the solvent particle i after collision with the colloid j reads as

From Soup: 39 At the wall surfaces we also enforce no-slip boundary conditions using a stochastic reflection method but additionally we fill the wall cells with n s a 3 − N ξ “ghost” particles during the collision step ( n s a 3 is the average number of solvent particles in the collision cell ), because due to the random shift partially occupied boundary collision cells occur. 20 The velocities of the “ghost” particles are drawn from a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution with zero mean and variance k B T .

From cou.: 40 This thermostat acts locally and is unbiased with respect to the flow field and hence does not destroy the hydrodynamic behaviour, see ref. 18.
From Soup: 40 We employed the parameters Δ t = 0.2 τ , α = 3π/4, n s a 3 = 5 with . With these parameters the total solvent kinematic viscosity is ν = η / ρ ≈ 0.5 a 2 / τ ( ρ = mn s is the mass density and η the dynamic viscosity). 21 For the colloids we use M = 167 m , hard core diameter σ = 4 a and δ t = Δ t /4. We calculate the diffusion constant in a bulk simulation from the integral of the velocity autocorrelation function and obtain D = 0.013 a 2 / t 0. 17 With these parameters we achieve the hierarchy of time scales for a colloidal particle Δ t = 0.2 τ < τ c = 1.5 τ < τ B = 2.2 τ < τ ν = 8 τ < τ D = 307 τ , see ref. 22 . Here τ c is the time a sound wave needs to propagate over one colloidal radius (the speed of sound is ), τ B is the time the velocity of a colloid is correlated and τ ν is the time over which the solvent momentum diffuses over one colloidal radius. We performed simulations up to Pe max = 4.8 which correspond to a maximal Reynolds number of Re max = D / νPe max ≈ 0.125 < 1, such that inertial effects are negligible. To avoid compressibility effects we also ensure that the Mach number is smaller than unity, Ma max = 2 D /( σc ) Pe max = 0.024 ≪ 1. With these values of the hydrodynamic numbers and the hierarchy of time scales we are sure that a comparison with a real physical system is reasonable.

From Soup: 41 The system we consider contains N = 15 048 hard sphere particles and N s = 14 274 843 solvent particles in a box of L / σ = 18 and L y / σ = L z / σ = 54. We start our simulation with a fully equilibrated system under the influence of a constant force in the x -direction, i.e. particles have collected and settled at the top of the box. Then at time t = 0 we instantaneously reverse the direction of the force and monitor the evolution of the system until all particles have sedimented to the bottom.

From cou.: 42 At the wall surfaces we also enforce no-slip boundary conditions using a stochastic reflection method but additionally we fill the wall cells with nsa3 − Nξ “ghost” particles during the collision step (nsa3 is the average number of solvent particles in the collision cell), because due to the random shift partially occupied boundary collision cells occur.20 The velocities of the “ghost” particles are drawn from a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution with zero mean and variance kBT.
From Soup: 42 We compare our simulation to single-particle level confocal microscopy experiments with sterically stabilised polymethylmethacrylate colloids. The value of the Peclet number can be adjusted by variation of the density mismatch between colloid and solvent mass density. Prior equilibration was achieved by placing the suspension overnight such that it sedimented across a thin (typically 50 µm) capillary. The capillary was then inverted, and the evolution under sedimentation was followed. More details of the experiment are described in ref. 23,24 .

We calculate the diffusion constant in a bulk simulation from the integral of the velocity autocorrelation function and obtain D = 0.013a2/t0.17 With these parameters we achieve the hierarchy of time scales for a colloidal particle Δt = 0.2τ < τc = 1.5τ < τB = 2.2τ < τν = 8τ < τD = 307τ, see ref. 22.

From Soup: 43 A situation where a layer of a heavy fluid is on top of a lighter one is clearly mechanically unstable, i.e. the system is inclined to invert. During this process the initially flat interface starts to develop perturbations with a characteristic wavelength λ = 2π/ k , where k is a wave number.

From Soup: 44 We present snapshots of the time evolution of the system, in Fig. 1b–e from computer simulation, and in Fig. 1f–i from confocal microscopy . The similarity is remarkable, and we note that, at the very least, our simulation qualitatively reproduces the experiment. The time evolution in the development of the instability with a characteristic wavelength is clear. While snapshots in the gravity plane ( Fig. 1b, c, d, f, g, and h ) illustrate the overall process of sedimentation, snapshots in the horizontal yz plane show the transient pattern or network-like structure that results from the instability ( Fig. 1e and i ). At later times, the network structure decays and a laterally homogenous density profile develops where the colloids start to form a layer at the bottom of the cell which becomes more compact with time. In the initial regime of the instability, more precisely in a regime where the amplitude of an undulation is smaller than the corresponding wave length, the experimental and the simulation data are in line with the results of a linear stability analysis. A detailed comparison is presented in ref. 23 revealing a fastest growing mode with a wave number k max . †

From Soup: 45 Let us now study the solvent flow accompanying the colloidal instability. In Fig. 2 a , the solvent velocity field in the yz plane perpendicular to the driving force is shown at an intermediate height x = L /2. Inhomogeneities are revealed on the same length scale λ max as in the colloidal density profile. Actually there is a backflow effect associated with colloid-rich regions moving downwards and with solvent-rich regions of upward motion. This is clearly revealed in Fig. 2 b where a region rich in colloidal particles is shown as a dense Voronoi tesselation and clearly correlates with a downwards solvent velocity and vice versa . Again, the structures exhibit the characteristic length scale λ max = 2π/ k max , the fastest growing wavelength in the linear regime.

From cou.: 46 A situation where a layer of a heavy fluid is on top of a lighter one is clearly mechanically unstable, i.e. the system is inclined to invert. During this process the initially flat interface starts to develop perturbations with a characteristic wavelength λ = 2π/k, where k is a wave number.
From Soup: 46 We finally consider the spatial correlations of colloid-velocity fluctuations in the gravity direction in the plane perpendicular to gravity C x ( x , r , t ) = 〈δ V x ( x ,0, t )δ V x ( x , r , t )〉, where δ V x ( x , r , t ) = 〈 v x ( x , t )〉 − v x ( x , r , t ) are the deviations from the mean velocity in the yz plane at height x from distance r in this plane. We anticipate both positive correlations at short distances (within the same ‘branch’ of the network) and negative correlations at slightly longer length scales. At longer length scales again, the lack of long-ranged order in the network leads to a loss of correlation and a decay lim r → ∞ C x ( x , r , t ) = 0. In Fig. 3 a–c the chronological development of the logarithm of the absolute value of C x ( x , r , t ) is shown at the height x = L /2 for Pe = 0.8, 1.6, 4.8, respectively. The maximum in anticorrelation of C x ( x , r , t ) is found at r ≈ λ max /2, see Fig. 3 d , in other words the length scale of the network structure corresponds very closely to the fastest growing wavelength predicted by the linear stability analysis. The velocity correlations become more pronounced in the non-linear mixing regime which is an indication of fully developed swirls of solvent and particle-rich regions. For Pe = 0.8 ( Fig. 3 a ) and for Pe = 1.6 ( Fig. 3 b,d ) the correlation length slightly increases in time, while for Pe = 4.8 ( Fig. 3 c ) it is markedly non-monotonic in time revealing a non-trivial interplay between sedimentation, hydrodynamics and confinement.

From Soup: 47 Using the MPCD simulation technique, we have presented an analysis of a hydrodynamic instability in a colloidal system confined in a slit of micrometre dimensions. Our results show good agreement between experiment and simulation, showing that the latter accurately describes the fundamentally and practically important phenomena caused by hydrodynamic instabilities.

From cou.: 48 Let us now study the solvent flow accompanying the colloidal instability. In Fig. 2 a, the solvent velocity field in the yz plane perpendicular to the driving force is shown at an intermediate height x = L/2.

Again, the structures exhibit the characteristic length scale λmax = 2π/kmax, the fastest growing wavelength in the linear regime.
From Soup: 48 Let us finally discuss some possible extensions of the present work: here we started with a sedimentation density distribution, typical for an experimental situation before turning over the cell . A sharp initial interface as often encountered after flow junctions in microfluidics as well as a linear density gradient, as often found in systems with source–drain stabilized electrolyte concentrations could also be addressed in principle by simulation. We would expect that the instability is most pronounced for high initial density gradients.
 ###### 
From cou.: 49 We finally consider the spatial correlations of colloid-velocity fluctuations in the gravity direction in the plane perpendicular to gravity Cx(x,r,t) = 〈δVx(x,0,t)δVx(x,r,t)〉, where δVx(x,r,t) = 〈vx(x,t)〉 − vx(x,r,t) are the deviations from the mean velocity in the yz plane at height x from distance r in this plane. We anticipate both positive correlations at short distances (within the same ‘branch’ of the network) and negative correlations at slightly longer length scales. At longer length scales again, the lack of long-ranged order in the network leads to a loss of correlation and a decay limr → ∞Cx(x,r,t) = 0. In Fig. 3 a–c the chronological development of the logarithm of the absolute value of Cx(x, r, t) is shown at the height x = L/2 for Pe = 0.8, 1.6, 4.8, respectively. The maximum in anticorrelation of Cx(x, r, t) is found at r ≈ λmax/2, see Fig. 3 d, in other words the length scale of the network structure corresponds very closely to the fastest growing wavelength predicted by the linear stability analysis. The velocity correlations become more pronounced in the non-linear mixing regime which is an indication of fully developed swirls of solvent and particle-rich regions. For Pe = 0.8 (Fig. 3 a) and for Pe = 1.6 (Fig. 3 b,d) the correlation length slightly increases in time, while for Pe = 4.8 (Fig. 3 c) it is markedly non-monotonic in time revealing a non-trivial interplay between sedimentation, hydrodynamics and confinement.
From Soup: 49 Finally, it is tempting to consider more complex interactions between the colloidal particles as realized, for example, for colloid- polymer mixtures where strong attractions can be realized. ‡ One would then expect a Rayleigh–Taylor-like instability with surface tension. 27 Also binary systems will establish a playground for sedimentation instabilities where separation and mixing could be tuned by the strength of the drive. External drives which are oscillatory in time could lead to segregation effects in the axial direction 28 and might be interesting for further study. If the initial density profile is crystalline in the lateral direction, 23 surface melting behaviour in non-equilibrium becomes relevant. 29 The recrystallization at the bottom of the cell 30 might be a complex process, in particular for attractive interactions and binary systems.

After all collisions within δ are completed, the new velocity of the colloid is updated as and the new angular velocity is where is the set of particles colliding with colloid in the time interval [ , + δ ] and = 2/5 ( /2) is the moment of inertia of the spherical colloids. where ( ) is the stochastic rotation matrix and is a thermostat operator (see below). ( ) is equal for all particles within the same but uncorrelated between different and in time. Due to this operation the particles exchange momentum in the while the total kinetic energy and the total momentum in the are conserved. It was shown that (2) and (6) lead in equilibrium to a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of the velocities and that Navier–Stokes-hydrodynamics is generated.
