From cou.: 1 The crystallisation, crystal structures, and crystal packing analyses of [Fe(phen)3]I14 and [Fe(phen)3]I18 are reported (phen⊕=⊕1,10-phenanthroline). [Ni(phen)3]I18 and [Fe(phen)3]I18 are isomorphous. These three compounds crystallise from iodine-rich solutions, and as crystals are relatively stable to loss of I2 over periods of weeks. Crystalline [Fe(phen)3]I14 contains parallel fourfold aryl embracing (P4AE) pairs of [Fe(phen)3]2+ complexes, while in [Fe(phen)3]I18 all embraces between metal complexes are disrupted. The filled aryl box motif (FAB) that occurs in [Fe(phen)3]I14 is comprised of four phen ligands from two complexes forming a four-sided orthogonal box, through which an approximately linear I6 chain is threaded. The extended polyiodide nets in each crystal demonstrate the continuum of I–I distances characteristic of a flat energy potential, and it is concluded that the dimensions of the polyiodide nets are influenced strongly by their association with the [Fe(phen)3]2+ complexes, and should not be otherwise deconstructed. Polyiodide sequences wrap the phen ligands, closely and effectively, running along their faces, in the grooves between them, and around their peripheries. The approximately linear C–H⋯I motif recurs at the edges of the ligand planes, and is evidently significant. The polyiodide U-clamp on a phen ligand is a prevalent motif. These structures demonstrate well the complementary orthogonality of the ligands in [M(phen)3] complexes with the angles and dihedral angles in extended polyiodide nets.

From cou.: 2 We are investigating the crystal supramolecular motifs adopted by coordination complexes such as [M(phen)n]z+ (phen⊕=⊕1,10-phenanthroline),1,2 and the supramolecularity of the relatively strong intermolecular forces between iodinous units (coordinated and uncoordinated iodide, iodine, and polyiodides) in inorganic crystals. Combination of these two systems, as cations [M(phen)n]z+ with polyiodide anions, provides a rich if slightly perplexing crystallisation milieu, and a remarkable collection of crystal structures.3 In other papers we describe the trimorphs of [Fe(phen)3]I12,4 the dimorphs of [CuI(phen)2]I3,5 the crystal structures of [M(phen)3]I7 (M⊕=⊕Mn, Fe),6 and the crystal structures of [M(phen)3]I8 (M⊕=⊕Mn, Fe).7

From cou.: 3 One reason for this richness is the complementarity of the metrical orthogonality of the cations and anions.4 The phen ligand planes in octahedral [M(phen)3]z+ complexes are planar and orthogonal, and sequences of iodine atoms in polyiodide anions also tend to have linear segments connected with approximately orthogonal bond angles and dihedral angles.8–12 This allows efficient entwining of cation and anion: polyiodide ions can lie along the faces of the phen ligands, or around their peripheries.3,4

 ###### 
From cou.: 4 Complexes [M(phen)3]z+ commonly adopt the parallel fourfold aryl embrace (P4AE), in which two complexes around a centre of inversion use two phen ligands each to form one offset-face-to-face (OFF) and two edge-to-face (EF) local motifs.1,2,4 In complexes with anions of relatively low volume these P4AEs are unimpeded, and can associate further in chains or layers. However, increased volume of the anions progressively disrupts the P4AEs. Here we describe and analyse in detail the crystal structures of two iodine-rich compounds, [Fe(phen)3]I14 and [Fe(phen)3]I18, where this disruption of cation embraces is pronounced and eventually becomes complete. We interpret the balance in these crystals of the influences of [Fe(phen)3]2+⋯[Fe(phen)3]2+ motifs, polyiodide association patterns, and various [Fe(phen)3]2+⋯polyiodide motifs, and conclude that details of the polyiodide nets are determined by the association with [Fe(phen)3]2+, and should not be interpreted otherwise.

From cou.: 13 Crystals of [Fe(phen)3]I14 and [Fe(phen)3]I18 were obtained from near saturated solutions of [Fe(phen)3]I2 in acetonitrile containing excess I2. Similar solutions on other occasions yielded other compounds in the series [Fe(phen)3]Ix, particularly [Fe(phen)3]I12, and in the results obtained so far there is no recognisable correlation between the molar composition of the solution and the composition of the crystals formed. We have already described some of the variability in crystallisation of [Fe(phen)3]Ix compounds,4 and it is evident that more subtle factors are affecting crystallisation. A series of [Ni(phen)3]Ix compounds can also be crystallised from acetonitrile solution, and [Ni(phen)3]I18 has been obtained from a solution with a high I2/[Ni(phen)3]I2 mole ratio of 50.

From cou.: 15 The crystal structures of [Fe(phen)3]I14 and [Fe(phen)3]I18 have been determined, and will be described. [Ni(phen)3]I18 is isostructural with [Fe(phen)3]I18. The molecular structures of [Fe(phen)3]2+ are normal in both compounds. The interest is in the crystal packing, the polyiodide network and its segmentation, possible supramolecular motifs between [Fe(phen)3]2+ cations, and the [Fe(phen)3]2+⋯Ix interactions. We will describe these features in turn for [Fe(phen)3]I14 and [Fe(phen)3]I18, after first outlining our approach to the analysis of the crystal structures of polyiodides.

From cou.: 16 The crystal supramolecularity of polyiodides is unconventional, in that there is not a clear differentiation of intramolecular bond distances and intermolecular interatomic distances. Over the full set of iodinous crystals in the Cambridge Structural Database the I⋯I distance spectrum in crystals is unusually continuous.12,13 This implies that there is a relatively flat energy potential for I⋯I separations in the range 3 to 4 Å, and this is supported by density functional calculations. In systems containing I2 and in polyiodides there is not a conventional intermolecular energy well for I⋯I interactions, distinct from the I–I bonding well, and the concept of a van der Waals surface representing the onset of intermolecular repulsion is hardly valid.13 This alternative paradigm does not apply to organoiodides.

From cou.: 19 In describing and analysing the crystal packing we first locate the [Fe(phen)3]2+ ions in the cell and describe their embraces, then describe and decipher the polyiodide net, and finally describe the relationships between the polyiodide and [Fe(phen)3]2+ motifs. Pairs of [Fe(phen)3]2+ ions form a good P4AE motif (Fe⋯Fe⊕=⊕9.13 Å), and these P4AE pairs are associated in zig-zag chains, illustrated in Fig. 1(a). These chains are well separated in the lattice, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Within the zig-zag chain, the longer juxtaposition of cations at Fe⋯Fe⊕=⊕10.75 Å is not a multiple aryl embrace, but instead an instance of an aryl box motif in which two [M(phen)3] complexes bring four phen ligands together to form four faces of an approximately cubic box. In [Fe(phen)3]I14 a linear section of the polyiodide chain threads through the box, as described below.

From cou.: 20 Examination of all I–I distances shows that there are many contacts in the range 2.7–3.6 Å, with the next largest I···I separation at 3.93 Å. Our calculations of the I···I potential indicate that distances up to 3.6 Å correspond to bond energies at least half of that of I2, and so the distances up to 3.6 Å are interpreted as polyiodide bonding. Fig. 2 shows the sequence of connected I atoms and the polyiodide net, the atom labelling, and the unique I–I distances up to 3.60 Å. This is a two-dimensional polyiodide net. Deconstruction of this net, focussing on its longest I–I distances of 3.52 and 3.60 Å (see bottom left of Fig. 2) would yield an I7 sequence, I1 to I7, and a centrosymmetric I14 sequence, I8 to I14–I14 to I8. In this interpretation the polyiodide formulation for [Fe(phen)3] I14 is described as I7− plus 0.5 (I142−). Further deconstruction would focus on the I14–I14′ distance of 3.42 Å, which if separated converts the I142− to two I7−. The I–I distance of 3.42 is flanked by shorter distances of 2.75 Å, but our calculations indicate that this I–I2 arrangement is within 8 kcal mol−1 of the energy of symmetrical I3,13 and therefore that this deconstruction is not valid. In essence, this structure is comprised of a zig-zag I7− (I1 to I7), and an I142− formed by centrosymmetric dimerisation of a V-shaped I7− (I8 to I14). These zig-zag and V-shaped I7− structures are distinct from the pyramidal I7− previously reported.11,12,14Fig. 3 illustrates the stereochemistry of the network of I7− and I142− ions.

From cou.: 21 We now describe the amalgamation of the polyiodide net and the array of [Fe(phen)3]2+ ions, to construct the complete lattice. First, the aryl box formed by two [Fe(phen)3]2+ ions (Fe⋯Fe 10.75 Å) is threaded by the approximately linear I6 section of the polyiodide net, I12···I13···I14···I14′···I13′···I12′. The resulting filled aryl box (FAB) motif is illustrated in detail in Fig. 4. The alternation of this I6-threaded FAB and the P4AE in zig-zag sequences ⋯P4AE⋯FAB⋯P4AE⋯FAB⋯ (see Fig. 1) are shown in space-filling representation in Fig. 5.

From cou.: 22 Next we describe the remainder of the association of polyiodide nets and the [Fe(phen)3]2+ motifs. Polyiodide sequences closely surround each P4AE pair of [Fe(phen)3]2+. Details are shown in Fig. 6, which is constructed around two P4AE pairs of [Fe(phen)3]2+ complexes, not in the same zig-zag chain but related by the 21 screw axis parallel to b (refer to Fig. 1). In the four parts of Fig. 6, segments of different polyiodide nets (indicated by different colours) are added in the sequence (a) to (d). Observe how each segment of the polyiodide nets is positioned parallel to the face of a phen ligand, and/or peripheral to the CH edge of a phen ligand: this is especially obvious for the orange polyiodide net in Fig. 6(b). The purple chain added in Fig. 6(c) shows clearly the linear I6 segment running through the groove of half of the FAB motif. There is a remarkably efficient arrangement of polyiodide chains in these facial and peripheral motifs around phen ligands, and the portrayal of the crystal structure in Fig. 6 illustrates very well the complementary orthogonality of the phen ligand planes and the twisting polyiodide chains.

From cou.: 23 Fig. 7 shows two perpendicular projections through the crystal lattice. It demonstrates the general linearity and orthogonality of sequences in the polyiodide matrix, and the orthogonality of the phen ligand planes in the [Fe(phen)3]2+ complexes and in the P4AE, and the strong correlation of these lines and angles in both the polyiodide net and the metal complexes. This crystal lattice is an excellent demonstration of the principle of complementary orthogonality for polyiodide nets and [M(phen)3] complexes.

From cou.: 24 Our conclusions about the crystal supramolecularity and determining factors for this crystal lattice are that the P4AE and its entourage of polyiodide segments is a primary influence in the crystal packing, and that the details of I–I distances along the chains are secondary. Therefore, the subdivision of the network of I atoms as I7− units would be of secondary significance, and this is consistent with our calculations of the distance–energy relationship in polyiodide chains.13

From cou.: 26 There are no embrace motifs between [Fe(phen)3]2+ complexes in this crystal. There is a general parallel plus orthogonal demeanour in the crystal packing, as is evident in projection down the c axis of the almost orthogonal lattice, Fig. 8. Each cation is fully surrounded by I atoms. Therefore we first analyse the polyiodide network, and then look at the interactions between this network and the [Fe(phen)3]2+ complexes. The distribution of I⋯I distances in this structure, presented in Fig. 9, shows that there are seven I–I units (1–2, 4–5, 6–7, 11–12, 13–14, 15–16, 17–18) with distances ≤2.8 Å, close to that (2.71 Å) in I2. There is a range of distances from 3.0 to 3.8, with the majority ≤3.6 Å, again consistent with the energy–distance potential. The I⋯I distances up to 3.6 Å in [Fe(phen)3]I18 generate the network shown in Fig. 10, comprised of a chain of I13 cycles, connected by I2 segments, and with two short appendages, I1–I2 and I16. Four different networks of this type pass through the unit cell.

From cou.: 27 Deconstruction of the polyiodide network would assign atom I3 to take more I− character because it is surrounded at distances of 3.17 to 3.49 Å by four of the shorter I2 units already identified. Further, the I6–I7–I8–I9–I10 sequence (distances ca. 2.8, 3.0, 3.0, 2.8 Å) is very similar to the bent I5− ion observed in many other structures.

From cou.: 28 The complete enclosure of the [Fe(phen)3]2+ by the polyiodide net and notable features of the association between [Fe(phen)3]2+ and polyiodide sequences are illustrated in Figs. 11 and 12. The polyiodide chains wrap around the faces of the phen ligands, in some cases as U-shaped clamps, and also participate in C–H⋯I motifs around the peripheries of phen ligands. The details of the close association of angular segments of the polyiodide net with the faces of phen ligands is clearly evident in Fig. 11, which includes a centrosymmetric pair of cations in order to reveal all of the associations. The chains of iodine atoms along the faces of the phen ligands are remarkable. Fig. 12 shows how segments of the polyiodide net wrap around the phen ligands, parallel to their faces and around their CH peripheries. Fig. 12 also shows the large number of C–H⋯I motifs formed approximately in the planes of the phen ligands, and with C–H⋯I approximately linear.

 ###### 
From cou.: 30 2+
From Soup: 30 The high proportion of iodine in the crystal has fully separated the [Fe(phen) 3 ] 2+ complexes and disrupted the embraces that form between them in all other [Fe(phen) 3 ]I x structures with lesser iodine content. 3,4
 ###### 
From cou.: 31 x
From Soup: 31 The polyiodide net is efficiently and tightly wrapped around the faces and edges of all of the phen ligands, allowing the I atoms to be located over the heteroaromatic faces of the ligands and to form C–H⋯I motifs in the ligand planes.

From Soup: 33 The compounds [Fe(phen) 3 ]I 14 and [Fe(phen) 3 ]I 18 have the highest proportion of iodine per complex amongst the 13 [Fe(phen) 3 ]I x complexes we have crystallised and characterised. 3 In fact, the number of iodine atoms per negative charge (9) in the stoichiometry of [Fe(phen) 3 ]I 18 is unusually high, and is just exceeded by the most iodine-rich polyiodide [(η 5 -Cp 2 ) 2 Fe] 3 I 29 15 where the ratio is 9.7.

From Soup: 34 The iodine-richness of [Fe(phen) 3 ]I 14 and [Fe(phen) 3 ]I 18 has disrupted the normal association of [Fe(phen) 3 ] 2+ complexes in crystals, allowing only the P4AE embrace in [Fe(phen) 3 ]I 14 . The complete absence of phen embraces in [Fe(phen) 3 ]I 18 is unusual. In other crystals containing [M(phen) 3 ] z complexes a favourable extended embrace is the one-dimensional strand in which each complex forms P4AEs with two neighbours, i.e. (···P4AE···) ∞ , 1,2 and this occurs in the trimorph C of [Fe(phen) 3 ]I 12 . 4 In [Fe(phen) 3 ]I 14 this one-dimensional motif has been modified by a threading of polyiodide chain between alternate pairs of complexes, generating the filled aryl box (FAB) motif, and a ⋯P4AE⋯FAB⋯P4AE⋯FAB·· strand. We observe the FAB motif in other crystal structures of [M(phen) 3 ] z complexes. Three different degrees of [Fe(phen) 3 ] 2+ ⋯[Fe(phen) 3 ] 2+ association occur in the trimorphs of [Fe(phen) 3 ]I 12 —1D P4AE chain, isolated P4AE, and OFF 4 —and in broad terms the four different structures for [Fe(phen) 3 ]I 12 and [Fe(phen) 3 ]I 14 are similar in terms of the extent of cation⋯cation embrace motifs. The previous conclusion for the trimorphs of [Fe(phen) 3 ]I 12 was that the [Fe(phen) 3 ] 2+ ⋯[Fe(phen) 3 ] 2+ , [Fe(phen) 3 ] 2+ ⋯I x , and I x ⋯I x interaction energies are closely balanced, 4 and that is reinforced by our interpretations of the structures of [Fe(phen) 3 ]I 14 and [Fe(phen) 3 ]I 18 .

From Soup: 38 Finally, the results reported in this paper (and in the other papers in this series 4–7 ) approach our goal of full analysis and interpretation of crystal packing and crystal supramolecularity, involving examination of every intermolecular locality in the lattice. The object is to identify and understand the supramolecular motifs which together determine crystal packing. A further stage, in progress, is to calculate and incorporate the supramolecular energies which are the ultimate arbiters in crystal packing.
