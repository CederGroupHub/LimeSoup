From cou.: 1 The electrooxidation of short synthetic 20-nucleotides DNA sequences with various amount of guanine molecules has been studied in a wide temperature range by square wave voltammetry and the results were compared with UV–vis and CD spectra. A twofold increase of dsDNA voltammetric peak, related to an increase in the number of electrons transfered in the guanine electrooxidation process was found to begin at a temperature lower by circa 20 °C compared to the well known increase of the dsDNA absorbance upon denaturation. Since the dsDNA voltammetric peaks are related directly to the electrooxidation of guanine and adenine, early conformational changes in dsDNA are responsible for this effect. An increase in percentage of guanine in the DNA chains caused a delay in the conformational, predenaturation changes. An exception to this behavior was found for polyguanine (100% guanine). Interestingly, two distinct ranges of change in ellipticity in the CD spectra correlate well with the changes obtained by voltammetry. We have also checked the influence of OH radicals and UV irradiation on the dsDNA oxidation.

From cou.: 2 DNA is a nucleic acid that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms and some viruses. The main role of DNA molecules is the long-term storage of information.1,2 In the living cells, DNA exists as a double-helix strand (ds)—two strands are twisted together around the common axis. Two single strands match each other if the corresponding bases in the stands are complementary. The binding is done through hydrogen bonds between the purine- and pyrimidine bases. Moreover, in the nuclei of living cells, during the replication-, transcription- and repair processes, DNA exists also as single-stranded (ss) species. The break-up of the ds species into two single strands is called denaturation. This process in living organisms is controlled by enzymes and involves, among others, the dissociation of the hydrogen bonds between the bases in the duplex. A disruption of the native DNA structure may appear as a result of modification of the bases or the sugar backbone induced by chemicals or light. In living cells such changes are reversed by specialized enzymes responsible for preventing a loss of genetic information.3 The complete denaturation process in isolated DNA can be induced by exposure to elevated temperatures,4 alkali or acids,5,6 aprotic or nonpolar solvents,7,8 or some drugs.9

From cou.: 3 There is a variety of ways to investigate the DNA denaturation process. The most common and also the oldest method is UV absorption spectroscopy.10 The amount of UV light (260 nm) absorbed by DNA is known to be proportional to the fraction of unbound base pairs in the chain. The unstacking of the DNA base pairs can be monitored by applying: dielectric spectroscopy, single molecule force spectroscopy, electron microscopy, Fourier transform IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism (CD), NMR, fluorescence emission, temperature gradient gel electrophoresis and electrochemistry.11–17

From cou.: 4 The main aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the amount of guanine (percentage of guanine in DNA bases) affects the electrooxidation of DNA chain and the denaturation process. It seems that the greater susceptibility to electrooxidation of guanine under given conditions should go together with an easier guanine chemical oxidation which is known to have biological consequences. The observation of the changes in the electrooxidation process of guanine, supported by spectroscopic measurements (UV–vis, CD), allowed us also to deduce the impact of the bases sequence on the dsDNA interactions with drugs. This observation may be relevant for understanding the mechanisms of DNA oxidation in the telomere regions and in studying the repair and remodeling of DNA. Of particular interest should be the places rich in guanine (e.g.guanine triplets). We have also performed the experiments to demonstrate how the amount of guanine in DNA chains influences the susceptibility of DNA to damage by OH radicals or ultraviolet irradiation. To realize the paper aim, appropriate synthetic oligonucleotides were employed.

From cou.: 24 Square wave voltammetry (SWV) was performed using an Autolab, EcoChemie potentiostat, controlled via the producer's software and a special cell with thermal circulation. The measurements were accomplishment in a temperature range 5 ÷ 100 °C (±0.5 °C) and were repeated five to seven times. All electrochemical measurements were carried out using the three-electrode system. Two platinum wires worked as the counter and quasi-reference electrodes. A regular reference electrode with a classical salt bridge was not used to prevent accumulation of DNA in the bridge frits. A glassy carbon disk electrode (GCDE, nLab, Poland) of 3 mm in diameter was used as the working electrode. Each time before use the working disk electrode was briefly polished with 0.05 and 0.3 μm Al2O3 powders on a wet pad. After polishing, to remove alumina oxide completely from the surface, the electrode was rinsed with a direct stream of ultrapure water (Mili-Q, Milipore, conductivity of 0.056 μS cm−1). The electrode surface was inspected optically with an Olympus, model PME 3, inverted metallurgical microscope. The solutions before measurements were degassed with pure argon.

The electrode was washed with water and exposed to a freshly prepared Fenton solution for 5 seconds; this exposure was repeated so finally the overall exposure time reached 150 sec.

From cou.: 29 To determine the convenient length of the DNA chain for the examination of the trends in DNA denaturation process the voltammetric and spectroscopic measurements of 36.2 μM dsDNA in 0.02 M PBS buffer solution (pH 7.4) were done at room temperature. These measurements were done for 20-, 40-, 60- and 80-nucleotides long DNA sequences; the percentage of guanine was 50%. We did not observe a substantial change in the height of the current peak for oxidation of guanine with an increase in the length of the chain. Partially is must be related to a decrease in the diffusion coefficient of the chains as the chain length increases. Another reason for the lack of the appropriate current increase is a possibility of curling up of the longer chains. Finally it can be assumed that the electrooxidation of all guanine molecules in the longer chains is not possible. We have decided to work with twenty-nucleotides long DNA sequences in our studies. Typical voltammograms and spectrograms obtained for the chains of different length are presented in Fig. 1S and 2S in the Supplementary Material.†

From cou.: 31 First the UV spectroscopic measurements of 30 μM dsDNA in 0.02 M PBS buffer solution (pH 7.4) were done at a temperature range 10 ÷ 100 °C (±0.5 °C). Typical UV spectra obtained at room temperature for dsDNA sequences differing in the amount of guanine are presented in Fig. 2A. After each temperature increment, before taking a spectrum, the solution was stabilized for circa 10 minutes. The absorbance value needed for monitoring the denaturation process was measured at λ = 260 nm; no bato- or hipso-chromic effect was observed during the temperature increase. However, there was an increase in the absorbance peak of dsDNA compared to 20 °C. The total relative increase was circa 32, 26, 24 and 32% for DNA 1, DNA 2, DNA 3 and DNA 4, respectively. The changes of absorbance of dsDNA sequences vs. temperature are presented in Fig. 2B. The absorbance data were normalized vs. their values obtained at 10 °C. Such increase in absorbance is commonly related to the dsDNA melting or complete denaturation (transformation into two single strands). Additionally, with an increase in amount of guanine in the dsDNA chain the melting temperature also increased. It is known that the stacking energies are bigger for the G:C-rich regions compared to those for the A:T-rich regions. Thus, a sequence rich in G:C pairs is expected to melt in a slightly higher temperature. Surprisingly, for DNA 4 (100% of guanine), there is a pre-wave in the absorbance plot that starts at a temperature of circa 25 °C.

From cou.: 33 The measurement of ellipticity (Ψ) is widely used to monitor the conformational changes of dsDNA caused by various experimental factors.18–22 It is used in this paper to detect differences in the conformations of dsDNA molecules containing different amounts of guanine. The CD spectra obtained for each studied oligonucleotide sequence are presented in Fig. 1A. It can be seen that all DNA samples are of right-handed form (A and B); strictly speaking DNA 1 (25% of guanine) and DNA 3 (75% of guanine) are of dsDNA B conformation, and DNA 2 (50% of guanine) and DNA 3 (100% of guanine) are of dsDNA A conformation. At all CD spectra the negative and positive bands can be seen. The negative band corresponds to the hydrogen binding between the nucleic bases, while the positive band describes the base stacking interactions.22

From cou.: 34 The dependencies of intensities of both bands on temperature are presented in Fig. 1B and C. A substantial increase in the value of Ψ in the negative regions of the CD plots (see Fig. 1B) has started at different temperatures for the studied DNA types. With increasing amount of guanine in the dsDNA chain the value of temperature where the hydrogen bonds between the nucleic bases break increased. In general, the stacking energies are smaller for the A:T-rich regions. Thus, the sequence TATATA would be expected to melt quite readily compared to the G:C-rich regions.

From cou.: 38 The square wave voltammograms of dsDNA strings with different amounts of guanine are presented in Fig. 2A–D. All plots have the same scale to make the comparison easier. Only at the voltammograms obtained for DNA 1 (25% of guanine) more than one peak can be seen (at 0.72 and 0.92 V), see inset in Fig. 2A. By comparing these potentials to those corresponding to the peaks of free dissolved bases and to those of preadsorbed dsDNA, it looks as if the first peak corresponds to the oxidation of guanine (G) and the second one to adenine (A).23–25 For the other DNA sequences only the peak of guanine appeared. The adenine signal is affected by the adsorption processes of the products of electrooxidation of guanine. With increasing amounts of guanine in the dsDNA chains it is more difficult to record the adenine signal. The oxidation peaks of thymine (T) and cytosine (C) cannot be seen, since, as it is well known, at a potential higher than 1 V the oxidation of water proceeds, and the signal from cytosine and thymine is effectively covered by the water/oxygen signal. The current increased linearly with increasing amount of guanine in the chain up to 50%, see Fig. 3. The points related to 75 and 100% guanine chains depart down from the linearity which means that not all guanine molecules are oxidized in rich-in-guanine short strands.

The oxidation peaks of thymine (T) and cytosine (C) cannot be seen, since, as it is well known, at a potential higher than 1 V the oxidation of water proceeds, and the signal from cytosine and thymine is effectively covered by the water/oxygen signal. The current increased linearly with increasing amount of guanine in the chain up to 50%, see Fig. 3 . The points related to 75 and 100% guanine chains depart down from the linearity which means that not all guanine molecules are oxidized in rich-in- guanine short strands.

From cou.: 39 The change in the voltammetric peak current (oxidation of guanine) is plotted vs. temperature in Fig. 4 for different sequences of dsDNA. The mean relative standard deviation of the measured currents equalled 5.3%. The currents in the plots were normalized similarly as absorbance, vs. their values at 10 °C for all types of examined dsDNA. In a temperatures range from 15 °C to 70 °C, the SWV signal of electrooxidation of guanine grew to almost a 2, 2.4 and 2.7 times higher value for DNA 1 and DNA 2, DNA 3 and DNA 4, respectively. Above 50- (DNA 1), 60- (DNA 2) and 70 °C (DNA 3 and DNA 4) the guanine voltammetric peak height stabilized.

From cou.: 40 The reported above increase in current might indicate that the number of electrons in the electrooxidation process is increased. It is known that guanine can be oxidized at room temperature in two two-electron steps.26 In the first step 8-oxoG is formed. So, in our work, due to the fact that in all cases the current of oxidation of guanine increased circa two times, we have done experiments to determine the number of electrons transferred. 7-μl dsDNA samples with 50% G–C pairs in concentration 67.75 μM were placed on the GC electrode surface and left for complete drying. After that the voltammetric examination was done. The charges under the voltammetric peaks (22.2, 27.2 and 45.8 μC at 10, 36 and 70 °C, respectively) indicate that the number of electrons transferred increased with temperature from 1.92 to 3.89. These numbers are very close to 2 and 4, which means that at increased temperature the electrooxidation process of guanine changes from 2-electron to 4-electron. This change is responsible for the increase in current in the temperature range just before the denaturation process.

From cou.: 41 Also: the numbers illustrating the factor of current increase related to the 75- and 100% guanine chains are distinctly higher than 2, which indicates that complete electrooxidation of some guanine molecules in the 2-e process in the chains was not possible at lower temperatures. This is in agreement with the current plot in Fig. 3, where a deviation from linearity is seen for guanine rich nucleotides.

From cou.: 42 Contrary, the increase in absorbance started only at circa 40 °C and reached the maximum at a distinctly higher temperature. Only for polyguanine DNA sequence (DNA 4) the absorbance started to change at the same temperature as that for the current. Regarding the current change in the temperature range below 36 °C the conformation changes of the deoxyribose are responsible. This difference between voltammetry and spectroscopy is a result of higher sensitivity of voltammetry to small changes in the dsDNA helix structure.

From cou.: 43 A comparison of melting temperatures of studied oligonucleotide sequences, and conformation-change temperatures, calculated from UV and SWV data, is presented in Table 1. It is worth noting here that an increase in the guanine percentage leads to an increase in the melting temperature (the stability of the helisa increases), and the pre-melting conformation-change temperatures are lower by circa 20 °C compared to the melting temperatures.

From cou.: 44 The hydroxyl radical is the most reactive oxygen species (ROS). It reacts, among others, with lipids, proteins, sugars and DNA.27 When the number of ROS-induced damages in the DNA chain reaches a significant value then the so-called SOS system is activated which repairs DNA fast, but often inaccurately. SOS reproduces the structure of DNA, makes the DNA replication possible, however, the nucleotide sequence may be incorrect. This usually leads to mutations. The reaction of hydroxyl radicals with DNA can cause damage to nucleic bases and sugar residues, or can break the phosphodiester bonds connecting deoxynucleotides.28,29Oxidation of nucleic bases in DNA chain can occur in several places. The best known DNA modifications involve the oxidation of guanine in position C8.29,30 The main product of this process is 8-oxyguanine.

From cou.: 45 We have investigated the DNA damage caused by OH radicals using DNA preconcentrated at the electrode surface. In the tests performed, a DNA-modified electrode was immersed in the Fenton solution. After an appropriate time of immersion in the Fenton solution the electrode was rinsed with pure water and immersed in 0.02 M PBS buffer (pH 7.4). Square wave voltammetry was quickly carried out to evaluate the current response. Then, the electrode was polished, another droplet containing DNA was placed on the electrode surface and, after drying, the freshly prepared electrode was exposed to OH radicals for appropriately longer time. As it is seen in Fig. 5, the subsequent, longer exposures to OH radicals cause considerable damage to DNA manifested by a substantial decrease in the current signal of the electrooxidation of guanine. The final extent of DNA damage, measured as:

From Soup: 52 UV irradiation leads to the deformation of the sugar-phosphate backbone in DNA, which is a result of formation of pyrimidine dimers (C–C, T–T, C–T). 31 T–T couple is the most frequently appearing dimer; it is formed between two neighbor thymine molecules (in the same chain) linked by bonds between atoms C5 and C6 of participating bases. Other dimers are formed between thymine and cytosine , and rarely the dimers are formed between two cytosine molecules.

From Soup: 53 The extent of the DNA damage caused by UV irradiation was calculated in the same way as for OH radicals, see eqn. (1) . For the DNA 2-, DNA 3- and DNA 4 sequences a strong effect was observed, see Fig. 6A . For up to 40 min of irradiation the fastest growth of the oxidation current was obtained for the 50% guanine sequence. For DNA 1 the final increase was only circa 20%. In this DNA sequence the most probable dimer is T–T, the formation of which cannot expose better the guanine bases. Partial unwinding of DNA double helix, can also lead to a greater accessibility of the guanine redox centers and finally to easier electrooxidation of guanine .

Other dimers are formed between thymine and cytosine, and rarely the dimers are formed between two cytosine molecules.
From Soup: 54 In DNA 1 there is a sequence of T–T–C, so the formation of T–T dimers is possible. Cytosine that forms a triple hydrogen bond with guanine has no neighbor pirimidine-type base and can not form a dimer. In this situation the availability of guanine for oxidation does not change significantly and the current increases by 20% only. The situation is different in DNA 2. Along the chain there are, one after the other, molecules of thymine , cytosine and guanine . The highest probability of formation is assigned to the dimer T–C. In consequence guanine is exposed and is easier oxidized. For other two DNA sequences only the C–C dimers can be formed and this is done not so easily compared to T–C. Correspondingly the guanine oxidation currents grow at a moderate rate.

From Soup: 55 The above conclusions are supported by the CD spectra shown in Fig. 7 . As we can see, the biggest changes caused by UV irradiation take place in the wavelength range corresponding to the positive band in the CD spectra which reflect the π–π interactions between the nucleic bases. A decrease in the intensity of this band indicates the occurrence of conformation changes which can be related to the formation of the dimers between DNA-bases in particular chains. 31 Contrary, only small changes were observed in the negative band, which indicates that the extent of the strand unwinding is very limited.

From Soup: 56 In Fig. 6B the UV–vis data have been presented. The changes in absorbance caused by irradiation are rather minor compared to the changes in the electrooxidation current of guanine .

From Soup: 57 We have found an apparent influence of the percentage of guanine in the synthesized DNA strands on the change in guanine current. First of all, the current increased linearly with the guanine percentage up to 50%. This, together with experiments with well known amounts of the strands adsorbed on the GC surface, indicate that the entire amount of guanine in the low-guanine short strands can be oxidized. Second, the plots of the guanine normalized current vs. temperature indicated that small conformational changes of DNA preceding the denaturation process trigger an increase in the number of electrons transferred during the guanine electrooxidation process and correspondingly the current intensity. This increase was well correlated with the ellipticity change in the CD spectra obtained. An unexpected behavior here was made by polyguanine (100% guanine ): the current increase in the I (guanine) vs. T dependence was split into two parts with the first rise located at surprisingly low temperature (below 30 °C).

From Soup: 59 Contrary to UV irradiation, the exposure of dsDNA strands to OH radicals led to the diminishing of the guanine oxidation current, since guanine is oxidised directly by the radicals. Chemically oxidixed guanine could not be further electrooxidized. This decrease was the strongest (by 75%) in the case of 100%-guanine strands.
