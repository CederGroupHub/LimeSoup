From cou.: 1 Digital simulations are a commonly used tool in electrochemical and electroanalytical research. However, even though the employed computational methods often feature significant complexity, testing routines are rarely specified or discussed in literature. In this work, we address this topic and describe approaches towards testing electrochemical simulation software. While focussing on simple systems featuring Nernstian reactions in 1:1 stoichiometries, we guide through rigorous testing processes of one- and two dimensional simulations with regard to applications in cyclic voltammetry. To this end, we compile expressions for the calculation of key values as references, discuss the conduction of convergence studies, and suggest approaches to automated software testing.

From cou.: 2 Recent decades have seen fast advances in a number of different fields of electroanalytical and electrochemical research including microelectrodes,1,2 nanoelectrodes,3,4 fast-scan cyclic voltammetry methods,5 and generator-collector or redox-cycling systems.6,7 In addition to progresses in experimental methods, these developments have often been facilitated by a detailed theoretical understanding of the respective systems, which was obtained from a mathematical or computational modelling. Digital electrochemical simulations are hence a widely used tool in today's electroanalytical research. With the increasing availability of and continuous advances in computational power, we have observed a growing number of publications on electrochemical simulations using either in-house-developed or widely-available commercial8 software. Such digital simulations can now be commonly found in literature while applications include diffusion-controlled electrode processes,9,10 nano-impact experiments,11–13 the modelling of single-molecule detection,14 electrochemical noise characteristics,15,16 and nano-scale effects like hydrodynamic adsorption.17 A number of different approaches have further been discussed in great detail in the textbooks18,19 by Compton and Britz.

From cou.: 3 Alongside the growing number of publications in this field, an increasing complexity of employed methods can be observed. This complexity may, for instance, arise from the application of sophisticated solvers, the coupling of large numbers of reactions or diffusion processes, the modelling of complex geometries, or the use of parallel computing on CPUs or GPUs. Additionally, simulations may include several thousand lines of code, which may reduce the facility of easy inspection. Hence, the definition and performance of rigorous testing processes is crucial in the development of such simulations.

From cou.: 4 In the following, we present a number of different tests for electrochemical simulations that are either generally applicable or that can specifically be used to assess one- or two-dimensional simulations. We provide expressions for theoretical reference values, discuss the conduction of convergence studies, and suggest a method for automated software testing. The pass of each test is a necessary requirement for successful modelling, even though it alone can never provide a sufficient validation. The results discussed deliver rather a number of strong indicators that can be used to evaluate if a software works correctly. Aside from the theoretical discussion, we additionally present the application of some testing procedures to an example simulation, which employs a finite difference approach to model cyclic voltammetry at a macro electrode. The methods presented, however, are equally applicable to simulations based on any other modelling approach, such as finite elements8 or random walks.9,10

From cou.: 6 In order to illustrate the testing process, we apply the proposed approach to a simple electrochemical simulation software that solves the one-dimensional diffusion equations of two species subject to a Nernstian boundary at x = 0. The modelled space is defined through the two boundaries 0 < x < xmax, where xmax is chosen to be greater than with D representing the diffusion coefficient of the faster-diffusing species and tmax the duration of the experiment. The simulated space is discretised via an expanding grid that is parametrised through the initial grid spacing Δx(x = 0) and the grid expansion factor ω. The location of the ith grid point is calculated as follows:

From cou.: 9 As it is common practise in electrochemical simulations and for reasons of practicability, results are computed in dimensionless coordinates and then transformed into SI units (a detailed discussion can be found in18). Even though test procedures can equally be used in any system of units, it is advantageous to include the transformations into the finally used unit system in the testing process in order to cover all possible sources of errors. A list of all employed variables and their transformations can be found in Tables 1 and 2.

From Soup: 32 Tests monitoring the total number of molecules in a system are generally applicable to all electrochemical systems involving two active species, independent of the respective reaction kinetics. Since electrode reactions can only occur according to certain stoichiometries (here mA + ne − ⇄ qB ), the total numbers n A and n B of molecules of the species A and B must fulfil: at any time. In the case of continuous concentrations, this expression can be rewritten in the integral form: where we integrate over all simulated space.

The total number of molecules ( K n = const.) can be used as a test in all electrochemical simulations, while the point-wise summation of concentrations ( K c = const.) can be additionally applied if both species feature equal diffusion coefficients. In the case of reversible reactions, the peak separation Δ E pp can be used as a measure and the peak height I p can be compared to theoretical values for both micro- and macroelectrodes. Furthermore, mid-point potentials E mid and half-wave potentials E 1/2 can be controlled in the one- and two-dimensional cases, respectively.

From Soup: 56 The above-discussed methods provide a number of tests and theory values that can be applied to or compared with simulation results. However, since simulation approaches such as finite differences or random walks are numerical methods, the simulation results obtained will never exactly match theory values but converge to them. Convergence then depends on a number of different parameters that may either be intrinsic parameters of the simulation method or the employed computational means. For instance, results may converge with a decreasing grid spacing in a finite difference simulation or with the a decrease in the spatial displacement in a random walk, while they may additionally converge with increasing bit depth of the floating-point variables used in the computation. It is hence crucial to identify all simulation parameters (or sets of interdependent parameters) that impact the accuracy of the simulation results and to perform rigorous convergence studies on them.

From Soup: 57 Once all relevant parameters are identified, they can be are varied while the accuracy of computed results is monitored. As the computational workload is usually a function of these parameters, convergence studies often result in trade-off situations between the accuracy of simulation results and the required computation time, which must be solved through an exact definition of the necessary accuracy.

To this end, we define four measured quantities Q i that we monitor as a function of Δ x ( x = 0):
 ###### 
From cou.: 59 Table 3 presents an overview of applicable tests for a number of different simulation types. The total number of molecules (Kn = const.) can be used as a test in all electrochemical simulations, while the point-wise summation of concentrations (Kc = const.) can be additionally applied if both species feature equal diffusion coefficients. In the case of reversible reactions, the peak separation ΔEpp can be used as a measure and the peak height Ip can be compared to theoretical values for both micro- and macroelectrodes. Furthermore, mid-point potentials Emid and half-wave potentials E1/2 can be controlled in the one- and two-dimensional cases, respectively. Chronoamperograms at large overpotentials can further be compared to the Cottrell equation for macro-electrodes and to the Shoup–Szabo equation for micro-disk electrodes.
From Soup: 59 Fig. 2 presents the results of all quantities Q i for Δ X ( X = 0) being varied in a range of seven orders of magnitude from 10 −3 to 10 −10 . Given the required accuracy of the simulation, the respective minimum value for Δ X ( X = 0) can be found in the plot as the highest value of Δ X ( X = 0) that satisfies all accuracy targets.
 ###### 
From cou.: 60 The above-discussed methods provide a number of tests and theory values that can be applied to or compared with simulation results. However, since simulation approaches such as finite differences or random walks are numerical methods, the simulation results obtained will never exactly match theory values but converge to them. Convergence then depends on a number of different parameters that may either be intrinsic parameters of the simulation method or the employed computational means. For instance, results may converge with a decreasing grid spacing in a finite difference simulation or with the a decrease in the spatial displacement in a random walk, while they may additionally converge with increasing bit depth of the floating-point variables used in the computation. It is hence crucial to identify all simulation parameters (or sets of interdependent parameters) that impact the accuracy of the simulation results and to perform rigorous convergence studies on them.
From Soup: 60 As it was illustrated in the previous section, a rigorous analysis of simulation software requires the use of a number of testing methods that must be each repeatedly applied in convergence studies. For instance, in the here-described case of a 1 : 1 stoichiometry and Nernstian boundary conditions, we find six different testing methods (in both the one- and two dimensions case) that are subject to three convergence studies with respect to the initial grid spacing Δ x ( x = 0), the grid expansion factor ω , and the potential step width Δ θ . Since Δ x ( x = 0) and ω are interdependent parameters, convergence must be simultaneously probed with respect to both parameters. Hence, a large number of simulations is run and analysed.
 ###### 
From cou.: 61 Once all relevant parameters are identified, they can be are varied while the accuracy of computed results is monitored. As the computational workload is usually a function of these parameters, convergence studies often result in trade-off situations between the accuracy of simulation results and the required computation time, which must be solved through an exact definition of the necessary accuracy.
From Soup: 61 In order to minimise the testing effort, it can be helpful to automatise validation procedures as sketched in Fig. 3 : In a first step, all parameters that impact the accuracy of the simulation are identified and all convergence studies are scheduled. Second, measurable quantities Q i are defined that reflect the accuracy of the simulation (see eqn (19) for an example). Third, simulations are automatically performed as scheduled, while after each simulation all Q i are computed and saved. In a last step, the computed Q i are combined to a common convergence analysis and a suitable set of parameters can be found.
 ###### 
From cou.: 62 In order to give an example, we perform a convergence study with respect to the initial grid spacing Δx (x = 0) of the above-described finite difference simulation and simultaneously use four different tests. To this end, we define four measured quantities Qi that we monitor as a function of Δx (x = 0):
From Soup: 62 With this work, we aim to points out the difficulty as well as the necessity of rigorous software testing and provide a general guide to testing electrochemical simulation software as well as a tool set to validate simulations of common models. To this end, we discuss the testing process of electrochemical simulation software for the modelling of electrochemically-reversible two-species systems with respect to the one- and two-dimensional cases of a macro- and a micro-disk electrode, respectively.
 ###### 
From cou.: 63 Fig. 2 presents the results of all quantities Qi for ΔX(X = 0) being varied in a range of seven orders of magnitude from 10−3 to 10−10. Given the required accuracy of the simulation, the respective minimum value for ΔX(X = 0) can be found in the plot as the highest value of ΔX(X = 0) that satisfies all accuracy targets.
From Soup: 63 We provide a list of expressions for reference values and propose a testing method based on convergence studies for the comparison to simulation results. We suggest to initially identify all independent simulation parameters that impact the simulation accuracy and to define measurable quantities for the achieved accuracy based on reference values. Convergence studies can then be performed on all measurable quantities and results can be combined in a common analysis. In order to minimise the required effort, we additionally propose an automatised approach to software testing.

From Soup: 89 where and , represent the reaction rate constants and the transfer coefficients, respectively. In the limits → ∞ and if transfer coefficients are equal, = = 0.5, this expression turns into Nernst equation and, hence, describes reactions in the reversible limit. In the case of boundary conditions based on Marcus theory, the reversible limit can be tested by application of the limits of an infinite reorganisation energy, → ∞, and → ∞. However, the validation of simulations using Butler–Volmer or Marcus kinetics in the above mentioned limits merely represents a necessary requirement for successful modelling for all values of , , and , but is not a sufficient requirement.
