From cou.: 1 We introduced a minimal model of the donor–acceptor interface encountered in organic solar cells to explain the efficient generation of free charges in these systems and we investigated the nature of charge transfer states formed by a delocalized exciton in the donor component. Contrarily to the generally accepted view excitons do not generate strongly bound hole-electron pairs, but relatively delocalized charge transfer states with energy very close to the energy of free holes and electrons. These states are kinetically more accessible from the exciton state and very close in structure to the free hole and electron states. The most relevant molecular parameter that affects the rate of exciton dissociation is the electronic coupling between donor orbitals and acceptor orbitals, i.e. the band widths of the donor and acceptor materials. Moreover, and to some surprise, we find that the process of charge separation is mostly a purely electronic process and a very similar physics can be described neglecting the role of nuclear degrees of freedom altogether.

From cou.: 2 The great technological interest in the development of organic solar cells has generated a good number of new problems of fundamental nature related to the charge and exciton generation and transport in these devices.1–5 In organic solar cells an electron donor (D) and an acceptor (A) organic material with suitable energy levels are put in contact. The absorption of solar radiation typically generates excitons in the electron donor. The exciton can dissociate at the interface between the donor and acceptor to generate free holes (in the donor) and electrons (in the acceptor), but the actual mechanism for the formation of free charges is not truly understood. Conventionally it is believed that, before dissociating, the exciton migrates near the interface where a bound charge transfer (CT) state is formed (see Fig. 1a). This state should subsequently generate free holes and electrons, but obviously this process is kinetically unfavourable and a bound CT state seems more likely to be destroyed by hole-electron recombination.6,7 The idea that a bound CT state is the intermediate between exciton and free charges seems not reconcilable with the experiments showing that most excitons generate free charges in good solar cells.8,9

From cou.: 3 A number of proposals have been put forward to explain the efficient generation of free charges. It was proposed, but a quantitative theory is still missing, that the excess energy generated when the bound CT state is formed from the exciton is not immediately dissipated in heat but it is used to promote the dissociation into free charges.10 Considering that some interfaces can develop an intrinsic interface dipole moment it was suggested that this is exploited to facilitate the charge separation process.11,12 Many authors have reached the conclusion that the delocalization of the charges in the CT state may reduce the barrier for generating free charges.13–16 Most importantly, device modelling seems to agree with electrical measurements if one could assume that exciton dissociation leads to relatively delocalized holes and electrons.17,18

From cou.: 4 To make progress with this problem one needs to identify what the nature of the CT state generated by the exciton is and, possibly, one should express the rate for the generation of such a CT state in terms of a few key system parameters. We have recently proposed a model for long range exciton separation in organic solar cell interfaces where we computed the likelihood that an exciton far from the interface can generate directly quasi-free electrons and holes without an intermediate state at the interface.19 In that work we made a number of assumptions on the nature of the disorder in the system that, while realistic, hide some of the interesting physics of the process. In this paper we study instead the absolute minimal Hamiltonian model that explains the efficient process of charge generation in organic solar cells.

From cou.: 5 The key elements of our model are the explicit inclusion of the hole-electron interaction and the description in terms of multi-electron states instead of one-electron states (Fig. 1b). To introduce the main idea of this paper through an intuitive example, we can consider a system composed by a donor and two acceptor fragments (DAA). The initial state can be thought of as a state where the excitation resides on the donor (D*AA). There are two possible charge transfer states which are two linear combinations of states (D+A−A) and (D+AA−) where the charge is localized on the two different acceptors. Since the two CT states have rather different energies it is expected that one of the CT state will have a strong (D+A−A) character and the other CT state will have a strong (D+AA−) character. It is not possible to tell without a model which of the two states will be more likely to be formed because (D+A−A) is more strongly coupled to the initial state, but (D+AA−) is energetically closer to the initial state. The naïve picture that the exciton at the interface generates a bound hole-electron pair may be very misleading and we will see in this paper that the formation of CT states with larger hole-electron separation is often the most kinetically favoured product.

From cou.: 6 We consider in this paper the highly idealized situation of two perfectly crystalline donor and acceptor materials sharing a defect-less interface. We consider the materials to be molecular materials so that the initial state is a Frenkel exciton in the donor (delocalized because there are no defects). We consider finite size clusters (of different sizes) in the absence of information on the actual delocalization length of the exciton. Apart from some simplifications introduced to limit the number of parameters, the model is representative of junctions realized from gas phase deposition,20 although it is more common that one of the phases is amorphous. Most of the conclusions of this paper, however, are immediately generalizable to more complicated and common interfaces.

From Soup: 68 To derive a plausible form for the coupling between Frenkel and CT excitons we consider again the theory of configuration interaction and assume that the Frenkel excited states | ij 〉 are described by an excited configuration from the HOMO to the LUMO of the molecule in site ( i , j ). If we consider that the Fock matrix elements between non-neighbouring sites are negligible, the only non-zero matrix elements between states | ij 〉 and | ij , kl 〉 involve the Fock matrix element of the LUMO of the donor in site ( i ,1) ( i.e. at the interface) and the LUMO of the acceptor in site ( k = i ,1) ( i.e. also at the interface).

From Soup: 79 Fig. 3a represents the density of states (DOS), for models with various values of V D , and Fig. 3c shows the charge distribution for a few selected states for V D = 0.08 eV. At very low energy there are few states corresponding to a tightly bound hole and electron near the interface. The energy of these states is close to the Coulombic interaction (− C ) between charges in neighbouring lattice sites. The comparison of Fig. 3a and 3c shows that, as the energy increases between −1.0 and −0.2 eV, the DOS increases and the CT states become more delocalized over the donor and acceptor clusters. The peak of the DOS corresponds to fairly delocalized states. The energy of these very delocalized states is slightly negative because of the relatively small Coulombic attraction between the holes and electrons. In the highest energy CT state, the charges are separated away from the interface. Having chosen V D = V A , the charge distribution is symmetrical with respect to the interface.

From Soup: 100 Fig. 3b also shows that CT excitons are more bound (more localized) for small coupling V D . If we consider that these states are originating from the interaction between quasi free hole and electron in the donor and acceptor material, larger coupling is associated with lighter effective masses and less localization. Several papers have successfully described the CT interface exciton in this way 10,29,30 focusing mostly on the lowest energy CT states. Our task however is to describe the generation of any CT state from Frenkel excitons.
 ###### 
From cou.: 101 P
From Soup: 101 If we indicate with k ( n )→( m ) the rate constant for the process from Ψ ( n ) FE to Ψ ( m ) CT , the total rate for the process of generating any CT state can be expressed as: Where , with k B T being the thermal energy. The Boltzmann factor implies that we are assuming equilibrium among the FE electronic states. The initial and final states are very weakly coupled (see below for a justification) and the rate constant can be evaluated from the theory of non-adiabatic electron transfer reactions. 31 The electron transfer is accompanied by a deformation in the equilibrium geometry of the molecule which is quantified by the parameter λ , known as the reorganization energy. If the nuclear modes can be treated classically the rate of charge transfer can be expressed by the Marcus equation: 31 where V nm is the electronic coupling between the initial and final states. In writing eqn (13) we have noted that the reorganization energy λ m depends on the final state states m (depending on the localization of the charge the reorganization energy may change). The combination of the two factors containing the term λ m are normally referred to as the Franck–Condon factor. When the reorganization energy in the molecular crystals is decomposed according to the nuclear modes that contribute to it, 32 it turns out that more than half of the reorganization energy is due to high frequency modes that cannot be treated classically. A more general expression taking into account the quantum nature of nuclear modes can be used but, as we will see in the result session, this is not really needed.

From Soup: 102 The coupling V nm can be obtained from eqn (6)–(8) :
 ###### 
From cou.: 103 E
From Soup: 103 Except when we have very small clusters of 1–4 sites, or when we consider very localized states, we have generally , i.e. the coupling V nm is always sufficiently small enough to allow the use of a perturbative expression, such as eqn (13) . It is evident from eqn (13)–(14) that the parameter V DA will only modulate the final rate (through its square) but has otherwise no effect on the physics that we wish to describe. For this reason V DA was set to the physically plausible value of 0.08 eV and left unchanged.
 ###### 
From cou.: 104 Fig. 3b also shows that CT excitons are more bound (more localized) for small coupling VD. If we consider that these states are originating from the interaction between quasi free hole and electron in the donor and acceptor material, larger coupling is associated with lighter effective masses and less localization. Several papers have successfully described the CT interface exciton in this way10,29,30 focusing mostly on the lowest energy CT states. Our task however is to describe the generation of any CT state from Frenkel excitons.
From Soup: 104 The reorganization energy is smaller for more delocalized states and it is approximately inversely proportional to the size of the system. 33 This has been verified computationally for polymers of different lengths, 34 for polyacenes of different sizes 35 and for a large set of conjugated molecules. 33 To incorporate this effect in the model we assumed that, for the computation of the rate k ( n )→( m ) , λ m decreases with the increase of delocalization of the charge in the CT state as λ m = λ 0 / P ( m ) , where P ( m ) is the number of molecules that share a positive or a negative charge as defined in eqn (10) and λ 0 is the reorganization energy for a system with only one donor and one acceptor molecule. λ 0 was set to 0.25 eV, based on calculations of organic donor–acceptor pairs reported in literature. 32 We discuss the (modest) effect of changing λ 0 within a plausible range 0.15–0.40 eV in the results section. This scaling of the reorganization energy with the localization length is valid as long as the system does not form small polarons, a situation that is likely for the most common high mobility materials. 23,27

If the nuclear modes can be treated classically the rate of charge transfer can be expressed by the Marcus equation:31where Vnm is the electronic coupling between the initial and final states. In writing eqn (13) we have noted that the reorganization energy λm depends on the final state states m (depending on the localization of the charge the reorganization energy may change). The combination of the two factors containing the term λm are normally referred to as the Franck–Condon factor. When the reorganization energy in the molecular crystals is decomposed according to the nuclear modes that contribute to it,32 it turns out that more than half of the reorganization energy is due to high frequency modes that cannot be treated classically. A more general expression taking into account the quantum nature of nuclear modes can be used but, as we will see in the result session, this is not really needed.
From Soup: 105 Table 1 summarizes the parameters used in the model, or their range when a range was used. The bottom of the excitonic band for a large cluster will be at E ex − 4| J | and this value should be greater than zero (the energy of separated D + and A − ) in order to have charge separation thermodynamically favoured for any choice of the other parameters. We have therefore set J = 0.06 eV, based on a typical excitonic coupling between organic crystals 36 and E ex = 0.25 eV. We have also considered narrower ( E ex = 0.13 eV, J = 0.03 eV) and broader ( E ex = 0.37 eV, J = 0.09 eV) excitonic bands above E = 0 as reported in the results section. Instead, it is probably not useful to consider excitonic bands at much higher energy (as in real devices that would dissipate too much energy and would probably involve further excited states of the acceptor).
 ###### 
From cou.: 106 The coupling Vnm can be obtained from eqn (6)–(8):
From Soup: 106 Considering the plausible range of parameters suitable for organic solar cell interfaces, it is already evident that the reaction that brings a Frenkel exciton at the bottom of the excitonic band ( E ( n ) FE ∼ [0.01 − 0.1] eV) into a strongly bound charge transfer state ( E ( m ) CT ∼ −1 eV) is always occurring in the Marcus inverted region, i.e. where E ( m ) CT − E ( m ) FE + λ m < 0. This fact is essentially determined by the size of typical organic molecules (setting boundaries to both the reorganization energy and the Coulombic interaction) and the low dielectric constant of the medium. In the Marcus inverted region the reaction is faster for smaller values of E ( m ) FE − E ( m ) CT , i.e. it is to be expected that the Frenkel exciton will not dissociate to form the most stable CT state, but a CT state closer in energy to the initial Frenkel state.
 ###### 
From cou.: 107 Except when we have very small clusters of 1–4 sites, or when we consider very localized states, we have generally , i.e. the coupling Vnm is always sufficiently small enough to allow the use of a perturbative expression, such as eqn (13). It is evident from eqn (13)–(14) that the parameter VDA will only modulate the final rate (through its square) but has otherwise no effect on the physics that we wish to describe. For this reason VDA was set to the physically plausible value of 0.08 eV and left unchanged.
From Soup: 107 Before studying the charge separation rate for different system parameters it is convenient to consider in detail the process of charge separation from the lowest energy FE state, which we can denote as Ψ (1) FE . The total rate of charge separation from this state is and the probability that the system is found in state Ψ ( m ) FE after the charge separation has taken place is k (1)→( m ) / k (1)→ All . Therefore, the probability of having a given electronic energy after the charge separation process can be computed as:
 ###### 
From cou.: 108 The reorganization energy is smaller for more delocalized states and it is approximately inversely proportional to the size of the system.33 This has been verified computationally for polymers of different lengths,34 for polyacenes of different sizes35 and for a large set of conjugated molecules.33 To incorporate this effect in the model we assumed that, for the computation of the rate k(n)→(m), λm decreases with the increase of delocalization of the charge in the CT state as λm = λ0/P(m), where P(m) is the number of molecules that share a positive or a negative charge as defined in eqn (10) and λ0 is the reorganization energy for a system with only one donor and one acceptor molecule. λ0 was set to 0.25 eV, based on calculations of organic donor–acceptor pairs reported in literature.32 We discuss the (modest) effect of changing λ0 within a plausible range 0.15–0.40 eV in the results section. This scaling of the reorganization energy with the localization length is valid as long as the system does not form small polarons, a situation that is likely for the most common high mobility materials.23,27
From Soup: 108 Fig. 4a compares the function P ( E ) with DOS CT ( E ) for the CT states. The key observation from this comparison is that the charge separation process selects states around E ∼ 0 and is not correlated at all with the DOS of the CT states. The rate (see eqn (13) and below) is determined by two terms: the coupling | V mn | 2 , which roughly decreases with increasing the energy, and the Franck–Condon factor, that has a maximum for E ( m ) CT − E (1) FE + λ m ∼ 0.

From cou.: 109 Table 1 summarizes the parameters used in the model, or their range when a range was used. The bottom of the excitonic band for a large cluster will be at Eex − 4|J| and this value should be greater than zero (the energy of separated D+ and A−) in order to have charge separation thermodynamically favoured for any choice of the other parameters. We have therefore set J = 0.06 eV, based on a typical excitonic coupling between organic crystals36 and Eex = 0.25 eV.

From cou.: 110 Considering the plausible range of parameters suitable for organic solar cell interfaces, it is already evident that the reaction that brings a Frenkel exciton at the bottom of the excitonic band (E(n)FE ∼ [0.01 − 0.1] eV) into a strongly bound charge transfer state (E(m)CT ∼ −1 eV) is always occurring in the Marcus inverted region, i.e. where E(m)CT − E(m)FE + λm < 0. This fact is essentially determined by the size of typical organic molecules (setting boundaries to both the reorganization energy and the Coulombic interaction) and the low dielectric constant of the medium. In the Marcus inverted region the reaction is faster for smaller values of E(m)FE − E(m)CT, i.e. it is to be expected that the Frenkel exciton will not dissociate to form the most stable CT state, but a CT state closer in energy to the initial Frenkel state.
From Soup: 110 This coupling decreases with increasing energy because low energy states are near the interface and therefore strongly coupled with the CT state (see Fig. 3c and eqn (14) ). Fig. 4b shows that this decrease is approximately exponential at sufficiently large energies.

From Soup: 118 The Franck–Condon energy dependence dominates over the energy dependence of the effective coupling and the majority of the CT states are formed closer to the maximum of the Franck–Condon factor (shifted to lower energies because of the exponential decrease of the coupling). Essentially all the results presented in this section can be understood in terms of the contrasting energy dependence of the two functions V 2 ( E ) and F ( E ) that contribute to the charge separation rate.
 ###### 
From cou.: 119 P
From Soup: 119 In Fig. 3a we have seen that the effect of the coupling V D (= V A ) was to broaden the DOS CT . However, this effect is not particularly important for the computation of the k (1)→All rate of charge separation. More important is that CT states at the energy where the charge transfer takes place are more delocalized for larger V D , and, therefore, the coupling between these states and the Frenkel exciton is larger. Fig. 4b shows that for E > −0.2 eV (where the CT actually takes place) the average square coupling V 2 ( E ) increases with increasing the coupling V D . Consequently the rate of charge separation increases for increased values of V D , as reported in Fig. 5 . The interesting result is therefore that the donor and acceptor materials with broader bands (smaller effective masses) will facilitate not only the transport of holes and electrons, but also the formation of charge separated states.
 ###### 
From cou.: 120 E
From Soup: 120 Another interesting point is that the charge separation process does not involve low energy bound CT states at the interface. The fact that these bound CT states can be more or less delocalized depending on the value of V D 10 is not of direct relevance for the problem of charge separation. In realistic situations, if the band widths of the donor or acceptor are too small, the charge separation rate can be too slow and the exciton will more likely relax to the ground state without generating charges.

From cou.: 121 The Franck–Condon energy dependence dominates over the energy dependence of the effective coupling and the majority of the CT states are formed closer to the maximum of the Franck–Condon factor (shifted to lower energies because of the exponential decrease of the coupling). Essentially all the results presented in this section can be understood in terms of the contrasting energy dependence of the two functions V2(E) and F(E) that contribute to the charge separation rate.
From Soup: 121 Fig. 5 presents a comparison of the rates k TOT and k (1)→All for different values of V D to show that the two rates are only marginally different. This happens because the charge separation occurs from states at the bottom of the excitonic band. Consequently, the width of the excitonic band (associated to the exciton effective mass and the parameter J ) is not expected to be a crucial parameter. To verify this fact we report in the same figure the total rate for V D = 0.06 eV and with excitonic bands 50% broader or narrower: the total rate is essentially unaffected by the exciton band-width.
 ###### 
From cou.: 122 In Fig. 3a we have seen that the effect of the coupling VD (=VA) was to broaden the DOSCT. However, this effect is not particularly important for the computation of the k(1)→All rate of charge separation. More important is that CT states at the energy where the charge transfer takes place are more delocalized for larger VD, and, therefore, the coupling between these states and the Frenkel exciton is larger. Fig. 4b shows that for E > −0.2 eV (where the CT actually takes place) the average square coupling V2(E) increases with increasing the coupling VD. Consequently the rate of charge separation increases for increased values of VD, as reported in Fig. 5. The interesting result is therefore that the donor and acceptor materials with broader bands (smaller effective masses) will facilitate not only the transport of holes and electrons, but also the formation of charge separated states.
From Soup: 122 Slightly more important is the energy position of the lowest excitonic band edge, which determines the initial state energy. Consistent with the charge separation occurring in the inverted Marcus region, the charge separation rate (square symbol in Fig. 5 ) decreases when the exciton band energy is shifted upwards. However, as we noted above, these parameters cannot be set freely as an excitation energy too low will make the charge separation process thermodynamically unfavourable and an excitation energy too high will make the charge separation process too energy wasteful.
 ###### 
From cou.: 123 Another interesting point is that the charge separation process does not involve low energy bound CT states at the interface. The fact that these bound CT states can be more or less delocalized depending on the value of VD10 is not of direct relevance for the problem of charge separation. In realistic situations, if the band widths of the donor or acceptor are too small, the charge separation rate can be too slow and the exciton will more likely relax to the ground state without generating charges.
From Soup: 123 It is illustrative to compute the total rate of charge separation k TOT for different shapes of the donor–acceptor cluster ( Fig. 6 ). We considered for example clusters with n x = 4 and n z varying from 1 to 12 (see inset in the same figure). For thin interfaces (1 < n z < 3) k TOT increases with the increase of the cluster size. This is because the cluster is too thin to develop high energy delocalized CT states and the rate is decreased by an unfavourable Franck–Condon factor. When the clusters are thicker than n z = 4, k TOT does not change much but decreases as the size of the cluster increases. This is because, for larger clusters, the delocalized exciton is less coupled with the CT state (it is more “diluted”). It is remarkable that this decrease is so slow, i.e. if the exciton is delocalized, the formation of charge separated states may happen when the “centre” of the exciton is many layers away from the interface. This is in strong contrast with the view that an exciton should be localized at the interface to be split into free charges. Of course, in practice, an exciton cannot be unlimitedly delocalized, but delocalization over tens or hundreds of molecules seems to be the most consistent with the available spectroscopic data. 37,38

From cou.: 124 Fig. 5 presents a comparison of the rates kTOT and k(1)→All for different values of VD to show that the two rates are only marginally different. This happens because the charge separation occurs from states at the bottom of the excitonic band. Consequently, the width of the excitonic band (associated to the exciton effective mass and the parameter J) is not expected to be a crucial parameter. To verify this fact we report in the same figure the total rate for VD = 0.06 eV and with excitonic bands 50% broader or narrower: the total rate is essentially unaffected by the exciton band-width.
From Soup: 124 Similar calculations repeated with fixed small n z and variable n x give qualitatively similar results (not shown), i.e. what promotes efficient charge separation is the availability of CT states at the right energy and it is equivalent if the hole and electrons in these states are separated along the z or the x direction. In more realistic systems the bandwidth along the x and z direction is different and one can think that broader bands in the z directions are the most favourable to prevent charge recombination. Very interesting, these ideas begin to be explored experimentally, for example with time-resolved two- photon photoemission. 39

 ###### 
From cou.: 126 It is illustrative to compute the total rate of charge separation kTOT for different shapes of the donor–acceptor cluster (Fig. 6). We considered for example clusters with nx = 4 and nz varying from 1 to 12 (see inset in the same figure). For thin interfaces (1 < nz < 3) kTOT increases with the increase of the cluster size. This is because the cluster is too thin to develop high energy delocalized CT states and the rate is decreased by an unfavourable Franck–Condon factor. When the clusters are thicker than nz = 4, kTOT does not change much but decreases as the size of the cluster increases. This is because, for larger clusters, the delocalized exciton is less coupled with the CT state (it is more “diluted”). It is remarkable that this decrease is so slow, i.e. if the exciton is delocalized, the formation of charge separated states may happen when the “centre” of the exciton is many layers away from the interface.

From Soup: 126 The expression on the right hand side is just a Fermi Golden rule expression that would describe the charge separation if this were an entirely electronic process with no contribution from the nuclear degrees of freedom. The 8 × 8(×2) cluster that was used to illustrate the results in this paper is already very close to this minimum. Fig. 7 shows the rate computed for a range of values of λ 0 , including the limit λ 0 → 0 (until numerical errors becomes important). Maybe surprisingly, the reorganization energy that dramatically affects the charge transfer rate in single pairs of donor and acceptor is of modest importance for the system containing a cluster of donor and acceptor molecules: the charge separation rate in the limit λ 0 → 0 is only half of that computed with the reference value used in this paper ( λ 0 = 0.25 eV). This fact suggests that, although the process of charge separation in these interfaces has been principally considered a “chemical” process involving nuclear reorganization, it is to a large extent a purely electronic process and can be described to a good degree of accuracy by a purely electronic Hamiltonian. Also for this reason we did not present the results where eqn (13) is improved to take into account the quantum nature of some vibrations.

From Soup: 128 (1) Excitons do not generate strongly bound hole-electron pairs, but relatively delocalized charge transfer states with energy very close to the energy of free holes and electrons.

From Soup: 129 (2) The most relevant molecular parameter that affects the rate of exciton dissociation is the electronic coupling between donor orbitals and acceptor orbitals, i.e. the band widths of the donor and acceptor materials. These parameters are important, not because they generate more delocalized CT states at the interface (which do not play any role in the charge separation process), but because they increase the effective coupling between the initial Frenkel exciton state and the final charge transfer (delocalized) state.

From Soup: 130 (3) The process of charge separation is, to a large extent, an electronic process and a very similar physics can be described neglecting the role of nuclear motions altogether. This happens because the delocalization of hole and electron dramatically decreases the coupling with the nuclear degrees of freedom.

From cou.: 131 (1) Excitons do not generate strongly bound hole-electron pairs, but relatively delocalized charge transfer states with energy very close to the energy of free holes and electrons. These states are kinetically more accessible from the exciton state and very close in structure to the free hole and electron states.
From Soup: 131 Setting aside the many idealizations present in our model, whose relevance will be investigated in future works, the key difference between the presented description and the commonly accepted picture is that we did not use a single electron approximation to describe the charge separation process. It is customary in solid state physics to consider all charge transfer processes as occurring by electron transfer from one orbital to another, with the energy difference of the process given by the energy difference between the initial and final orbital energy. This single electron picture ( e.g. in Fig. 1a ) is accurate if we can assume that the energy of an electron is not affected by the occupation of the other orbitals, but this is clearly not true for the charge transfer state where the hole and electron wavefunctions generated by a single Frenkel exciton are entangled. The band diagram of holes and electrons is not at all representative of the process of charge separation which needs to be described in term of states . Once we have described the process as a mostly electronic process involving two sets of states ( Fig. 1b ) we made considerable progress and realized that there is no real kinetic barrier for the generation of free changes. Crucially, we have considered all charge transfer states, not just the ones that are generally assumed to be important and this is the main departure from other state-based models. The scheme of Fig. 1b remains valid if we move from the idealized situation described in this paper to a more realistic interface, involving disorder and more localized states, a situation that was investigated in ref. 19 . The problem of explaining the efficient generation of free carriers in organic solar cells seems now really manageable if the few steps above are taken.
 ###### 
From cou.: 132 (2) The most relevant molecular parameter that affects the rate of exciton dissociation is the electronic coupling between donor orbitals and acceptor orbitals, i.e. the band widths of the donor and acceptor materials. These parameters are important, not because they generate more delocalized CT states at the interface (which do not play any role in the charge separation process), but because they increase the effective coupling between the initial Frenkel exciton state and the final charge transfer (delocalized) state.
From Soup: 132 A number of recent experimental evidences seem to support the view of charge separation proposed in this paper. The necessity of a sufficiently large cluster of acceptors to promote charge separation was proposed by the Eindhoven group 40 and the importance of highly crystalline interfaces to promote delocalization has been highlighted a few times for polymer solar cells. 8,41 The temperature independent generation of CT states measured by many authors 15,42,43 is also fully consistent with the picture proposed in this paper, where the role of nuclear motions becomes marginal and the charge transfer happens by population transfer between quasi degenerate Frenkel and CT states.
 ###### 
From cou.: 133 (3) The process of charge separation is, to a large extent, an electronic process and a very similar physics can be described neglecting the role of nuclear motions altogether. This happens because the delocalization of hole and electron dramatically decreases the coupling with the nuclear degrees of freedom.
From Soup: 133 There are two directions of further investigation suggested by this work. First, one should relax some of the approximations made to reduce the number of parameters of the model ( e.g. V D = V A , square lattice arrangement, identical coupling along the x or y direction) and substitute these with realistic evaluations for systems with known morphology at the interface. Secondly, having realized that there is a strong coupling between exciton delocalization and charge separation dynamics, it becomes even more important to look again at the source of exciton localization in molecular crystals (and other organic semiconductors). While it was traditionally thought that the exciton migration and exciton dissociation process in organic photovoltaics can be considered independently, this and other works 19 suggest that the dynamics of the exciton and its dissociation into hole and electron are not really separable.
