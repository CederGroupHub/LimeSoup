From cou.: 1 Immunomagnetic isolation and magnetophoresis in microfluidics have emerged as viable techniques for the separation, fractionation, and enrichment of rare cells. Here we present the development and characterization of a microfluidic system that incorporates an angled permanent magnet for the lateral magnetophoresis of superparamagnetic beads and labeled cell–bead complexes. A numerical model, based on the relevant transport processes, is developed as a design tool for the demonstration and prediction of magnetophoretic displacement. We employ a dimensionless magnetophoresis parameter to efficiently investigate the design space, gain insight into the physics of the system, and compare results across the vast spectrum of magnetophoretic microfluidic systems. The numerical model and theoretical analysis are experimentally validated by the lateral magnetophoretic deflection of superparamagnetic beads and magnetically labeled breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells in a microfluidic device that incorporates a permanent magnet angled relative to the flow. Through the dimensionless magnetophoresis parameter, the transition between regimes of magnetophoretic action, from hydrodynamically dominated (magnetic deflection) to magnetically dominated (magnetic capture), is experimentally identified. This powerful tool and theoretical framework enables efficient device and experiment design of biologically relevant systems, taking into account their inherent variability and labeling distributions. This analysis identifies the necessary beads, magnet configuration (orientation), magnet type (permanent, ferromagnetic, electromagnet), flow rate, channel geometry, and buffer to achieve the desired level of magnetophoretic deflection or capture.

From cou.: 4 Here, we consider the competition between drag and magnetic forces on superparamagnetic beads and labeled target cells in a lateral displacement microfluidic system. A permanent magnet, angled relative to the flow direction is incorporated as a step toward the use of multiple magnets at different angles for directed separation of multiple targets to multiple outlets. A theoretical framework and numerical model, based on the relevant transport processes, is developed for the demonstration and prediction of magnetophoretic capture and displacement at various flow rates, magnet angles and distances, bead and cell sizes, and channel geometries. We first consider the lateral magnetophoretic displacement of superparamagnetic beads. This analysis is expanded to include the relevant case of magnetically labeled target cells. In an effort to efficiently investigate the design space and gain insight into the physics of the system, dimensionless parameters describing the magnetophoretic bead displacement are introduced. The use of dimensionless parameters enables results to be compared across the vast spectrum of magnetophoretic microfluidic systems. Similar dimensionless parameters have been introduced in the literature to characterize the deflection or capture of solo beads in their respective systems.28,29,32 Here, we expand on these parameters to encompass a more general geometry and incorporate cell-bead complexes. Investigating and characterizing biologically relevant systems is a crucial step, due to the inherent variability and distributions in the extent of labeling, i.e., distributions in antigen expression and beads-per-cell. These dimensionless parameters are used to provide design guidelines for the mode of operation, i.e., deflection or capture, as well as the magnitude of deflection for cell-bead complexes. Following a numerical characterization of the magnetophoretic system, an experimental validation is completed with both superparamagnetic beads and magnetically-labeled breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells.

From cou.: 5 We first introduce the theoretical framework and numerical model, based on the relevant transport processes, for prediction of magnetophoretic separation. The numerical model considers the competition between drag and magnetic forces on superparamagnetic beads and labeled target cells. The ratio of these forces is a function of the cell type (i.e., size) and extent of magnetic tagging, i.e., number of bound superparamagnetic beads. Magnetically tagged cells are modeled as spheres with an “effective” drag radius and magnetic susceptibility proportional to the number of bound beads. We consider a permanent magnet, angled relative to the flow direction, which applies a transverse force on superparamagnetic beads and magnetically tagged cells. This lateral force enables magnetic beads to cross parallel streamlines (Fig. 1). In this model, we consider dilute samples of beads and cells, in which cells are approximated as rigid microspheres and bead-bead interactions are neglected. For mammalian cells and superparamagnetic beads with diameters on the order of microns, our microfluidic system is characterized by a large Péclet number (ul/D), where the diffusion and sedimentation timescales are much longer than other relevant processes (advection and magnetophoresis) and are therefore neglected. We also neglect the cell-bead binding kinetics, which are assumed to happen upstream of the magnetophoretic separation. All nomenclature used here are defined in the text and listed in ESI.†

From cou.: 19 This system of equations is solved in MATLAB39 using a Runge–Kutta method with the following initial conditions for the particle position and velocity: X(0) = 0; Z(0) = 0; up,X(0) = U, where U is the average linear velocity; and up,Z(0) = 0. The system of equations is solved considering the buffer fluid as water with viscosity, η = 0.001 N s m−2, and density, ρf = 1000 kg m−3. Superparamagnetic beads of various diameters are considered, all with density, ρb = 1800 kg m−3 and effective susceptibility, χeff = 1.4.31 For the representative numerical simulations demonstrated here, a 1.5 mm wide microfluidic channel is considered. It should be noted that the numerical model and theoretical framework are not bound by flow through a microfluidic channel. For an infinite magnet and domain, deflection is only a function of the relative forces. The permanent magnet is assigned width and height of 1.60 mm and 12.65 mm, respectively. Baseline values for the distance between the microfluidic channel centerline and magnet edge, average linear velocity (U), superparamagnetic bead radius (Rb), and magnet angle (θ) are 1.5 mm, 0.02 m s−1, 3.5 μm, and 15°, respectively. The boundary conditions at the channel wall allow for particle slip, up,X|wall ≠ 0, but not penetration, up,Z|wall = 0. Fig. 2(a) demonstrates a top-down view of the pathline, or particle trajectory, in the microfluidic channel for a few representative cases given the above system parameters. The flow streamlines are all parallel, flowing from left to right in this arrangement. The external magnetic force on the superparamagnetic beads enables them to cross these streamlines and separate across the microfluidic channel. Fig. 2(a) shows the magnet retarding the progression of the superparamagnetic beads and laterally deflecting them across the channel for a number of flow rates.

From cou.: 20 Fig. 2(b) and 2(c) show the simulated net lateral displacement across the microfluidic channel, taken at X(t) = 20 mm, as a function of system parameters. As intuitively expected and from previous magnetophoretic separations, the lateral displacement decreases as the magnet is moved further away (Figure S3(a)), the flow rate is increased (Fig. 2(b)), or the angle is increased (Figure S3(b)). Similarly, as expected, the lateral displacement of superparamagnetic beads increases as the bead diameter increases (Fig. 2(c)). The analysis of superparamagnetic bead deflection is useful as an initial investigation with the numerical model as well as for considering magnetophoretic separations of small molecules and cells such as RNA, proteins, small bacteria, and viruses. In these cases, the size of the superparamagnetic beads is much larger and the effects of the bound molecule or cell are negligible. However, in the case of enrichment of rare mammalian cells, the cell size is significant and multiple micron sized superparamagnetic beads can bind to a single cell (diameters ≈ 10 μm to 100 μm). In the next section, we expand the analysis to consider cell-bead complexes.

From cou.: 21 To develop sufficient magnetic deflection for cell separations in a realizable microfluidic device, a wide range of magnetic tagging may be required depending on the system. The extent of labeling will be a function of the target antigen expression by the cell and can be used in a properly engineered system to control capture and/or separation of the target cell (i.e., discrimination between the target cell with high expression and false positives exhibiting low expression). The variability and distributions in cell labeling must be considered for biological systems. The governing equations, (eqn (1) to (4)) can be expanded to consider cell-bead complexes. This becomes relevant to the magnetic force as individual cells bind with multiple superparamagnetic beads and as the size of the beads affects the effective drag radius of the complex. Corrections for total complex mass, mT, and effective Stokes drag radius, Rdrag, are incorporated for cell-bead complexes (details in the supplementary information, Equations (S9) and (S10)). It is assumed that the magnetic force acts on N individual superparamagnetic beads, while the drag force acts on a complex with effective drag radius, Rdrag. For cell-bead complexes, the model is in essence considering an “effective” spherical particle instead of an actual cell with attached superparamagnetic bead. An increase in the number of bound beads can be thought of as an increase in the effective magnetic susceptibility of this representative particle. In addition, increases in the number of cells or beads in each complex can be thought of as a variation in the effective drag radius of the representative particle. We can now investigate cell deflection and separation as a function of the microfluidic magnetophoresis system parameters.

From cou.: 22 As we expand the analysis to consider immunomagnetic labeling of cells, specifically mammalian cells, distributions in cell size and extent of labeling, as well as the possibility for multiplexed separations with multiple bead sizes, increases the system complexity. We demonstrate these aspects by simulating various cell and superparamagnetic bead sizes (Fig. 3 and S5). From eqn (2), we see that the magnetic force on a particle scales as its volume, and this is observed in the simulation for complexes by the increased deflection for cells bound by larger beads (Fig. 3) (i.e., a cell must bind with fewer large beads to achieve an equivalent deflection). Similarly, as the cell size increases, the drag force increases, and more bound beads are required for equivalent deflections. We also simulate displacement as a function of cell size for cells bound by a single 3.5 μm superparamagnetic bead (Figure S5(a)) and deflection of a large, 12 μm superparamagnetic bead, bound by multiple cells (Figure S5(b)). If we consider a system for the enrichment of rare cells, e.g., circulating tumor cells from whole blood, the level of potential interactions, distributions in cell radii, and extent of labeling drastically increases the system complexity. For example, Rao et al. measured an 86% coefficient of variation (CV) in EpCAM expression of CTCs for patients with ≥2 CTCs per milliliter of blood,40 and there have been numerous studies demonstrating the variability in cell size of individual cell lines,41,42 which doesn't even consider the possible variability in size between cancer types. In the next section, we simplify the system by introducing dimensionless parameters that govern the microfluidic magnetophoresis system.

From cou.: 23 For complex fluidic systems with large distributions of possible interactions, i.e., interactions ranging from small cells with high antigen expression (and therefore higher levels of tagging) to large cells with low expression, and competing forces, i.e., drag versus magnetic, it is useful to introduce dimensionless parameters that incorporate all of the system variables. This enables efficient design of system variables for desired applications and allows direct comparison between widely different devices and configurations, i.e., various microfluidic magnetophoresis systems. We consider the magnetic displacement of superparamagnetic beads, cells bound by multiple beads, and beads bound by multiple cells. The appropriate characteristic scales for the magnetic and drag forces can be determined by non-dimensionalizing the governing equation for particle motion (eqn (1)) and normalizing the velocity and magnetic field by the average linear velocity, U, and characteristic magnetic field, μoMsVmag/4πd3, where Vmag and Ms are the volume and saturation magnetization of the permanent NdFeB magnet, and d is the distance from channel centerline to magnet center. The magnetophoretic system is defined by a balance of the magnetic and drag forces, resulting in the following dimensionless parameter (derivation in the ESI†),

From cou.: 24 This term encompasses all the relevant magnetophoresis system variables into a single dimensionless parameter. The scaling analysis identifies two regimes of magnetophoretic operation. In the first regime, hydrodynamic forces dominate, Fdrag ≫ Fmag or Πmag ≪ 1, and the magnetic force has minimal effect on particles (superparamagnetic beads or magnetically labeled cells) flowing past the magnet. In the limit of this regime, Πmag → 0, the magnetic particles flow through unperturbed. In the second regime, magnetic forces dominate, Fdrag ≪ Fmagor Πmag ≫ 1, and fluid flow has minimal effect on particle motion. Similarly, in the limit of this regime, Πmag → ∞, the relative magnetic force is sufficiently strong to capture all magnetic particles. The focus of magnetophoretic separation in microfluidic systems is near the transition of these two regimes, where both hydrodynamic and magnetic forces are competing, Fdrag ≈ Fmag (Πmag ≈ 1).

From cou.: 25 Πmag is an expansion on the dimensionless parameters developed in the literature for other magnetophoresis systems.28,29,32 The most obvious differences in parameters are due to differences in configurations, i.e., angle of the magnet and the magnets used. Incorporating angled magnets and/or arrays of ferromagnetic wires/strips, instead of channel-flanking magnets, is growing in popularity and enables the use of multiple angles for directed separation of multiple targets to multiple outlets.17,26 In addition, the parameters found in the literature only consider the straightforward case for solo beads. While investigating solo beads is very instructional to the device design, the immunomagnetic labeling of cells introduces a unique set of challenges due to the intrinsic variability of biological systems. For example, when targeting a specific cell type, the extent of labeling will result in a distribution of beads-per-cell, based on the distributions in antigen expression level, point in the cell life cycle, cell size, and mixing method. Here, we also expand this dimensionless term to include the effects of magnetically labeled cell complexes. Πmag is inherent to the system and can be used to define both the capture efficiency (ratio of particles retained to particles introduced) as demonstrated by Sinha et al.28 as well as particle deflection as demonstrated here and by Tsai et al. with the incorporation of an inverse aspect ratio.29 Here, Πmag is used to delineate the transition from deflection to capture. For the majority of magnetophoresis systems, the balance between magnetic and drag forces dominates the system (i.e., diffusion, sedimentation, particle interactions, etc. are negligible) and Πmag is sufficient to characterize the system design and optimization.

From Soup: 50 We find that the normalized particle displacement, displ , is a function of the dimensionless magnetophoresis number, Π mag , derived above ( eqn (5) ) and a dimensionless aspect ratio parameter, Π AR , that is a function of the magnet width and angle, and channel width. This result demonstrates that increases in the number of beads, bead size, effective magnetic susceptibility, magnet strength, and magnet volume will increase the bead or complex deflection. Similarly, increases in the fluid viscosity, effective drag radius, flow velocity, magnet angle, or magnet-channel separation will decrease the total displacement.

From Soup: 51 Plotting the simulated normalized displacement, displ , against the product of Π mag and Π AR , collapses all of the simulated data (see Fig. 2 , 3 , S3 and S5) into a single curve ( Fig. 4 ). The displacement can be expressed as a function of all of the independent variables of the system in the form of two dimensionless terms, demonstrating the power of dimensionless analysis. It is now possible to quickly and easily compare magnetophoretic displacement for various combinations of system parameters and configurations, as well as between individual superparamagnetic beads and various cell-bead complex combinations. From eqn (7) , we would expect a linear relationship between displ and the product Π mag Π AR for a system that experiences a constant magnetic field gradient. However, for the system configuration considered here, the magnetic field and gradient are spatially nonlinear (Figure S1(b)). As shown in Fig. 4 , this results in the slightly nonlinear relationship, displ ∝ [Π AR Π mag ] β , where β is found to be 1.17 by regression. With a powerful tool for the design and analysis of magnetophoretic systems, we next experimentally validate the model and scaling analysis.

From Soup: 52 The realized microfluidic device for validation of the numerical model is based on the schematic from Fig. 1 (image available in supplementary information, Figure S7). The confining flow microfluidic device is fabricated by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Dow Corning, Midland, MI, USA) ‡ molding and plasma bonded to a glass slide. Details of the fabrication techniques and materials, experimental equipment, and specifics of the superparamagnetic beads and cell lines can be found in the ESI. † The device incorporates alignment marks for the permanent magnet placement (±2°) and contains a 1.50 ± 0.05 mm wide and 120 ± 20 μm high microfluidic channel. Initial experiments are completed with 3.56 ± 0.42 μm radius (Corpuscular Inc., Cold Spring, NY, USA) and 2.07 ± 0.32 μm radius superparamagnetic beads (Discovery Scientific, Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada). The buffer stream forces the sample flow along the edge of the microfluidic channel upstream of the magnet region. As the bead suspension flows past the magnet region, beads are deflected laterally across streamlines based on the hydrodynamic, magnetic, and configuration parameters. Displacement across the channel is measured from bright field images of the microfluidic channel taken far downstream of the magnet region. Lateral deflection across the microfluidic channel is measured using the NIH ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). The uncertainty in each deflection measurement is approximately 50 μm. Magnetic beads are pulled toward the adjacent wall upstream of the magnet, effectively focusing them along the wall and minimizing the spread in starting position. This reduces any dependence in displacement on the sheath flow thickness. Deflections are measured as a function of the average free stream velocity for two magnet angles and two bead sizes (Figure S6). Each data point and associated error bars represent the average and standard deviation of 20 to 100 bead deflection measurements from 5 images. The average free stream velocity is calculated from the respective flow rates and channel cross-sectional area. The uncertainty in the average velocity, based on the uncertainty in the channel dimensions, is minimal and neglected. As expected, as the flow rate increases, the hydrodynamic force increases relative to the magnetic force and lateral deflection decreases. Similarly, as the magnet angle is increased from 15° to 20°, the relative magnetic force perpendicular to streamlines is decreased, which decreases the lateral deflection. From the data for both bead sizes, we find that the lateral deflection remained equivalent or actually increased for the decrease in bead size. This unexpected result can be attributed to a difference in the effective susceptibility, χ eff , of the two superparamagnetic bead populations. By comparing the experimental results to the numerical model, we can infer that the 2.1 μm radius beads have an effective magnetic susceptibility approximately three times that of the 3.5 μm radius beads.
 ###### 
From cou.: 53 Plotting the simulated normalized displacement, displ, against the product of Πmag and ΠAR, collapses all of the simulated data (see Fig. 2, 3, S3 and S5) into a single curve (Fig. 4). The displacement can be expressed as a function of all of the independent variables of the system in the form of two dimensionless terms, demonstrating the power of dimensionless analysis. It is now possible to quickly and easily compare magnetophoretic displacement for various combinations of system parameters and configurations, as well as between individual superparamagnetic beads and various cell-bead complex combinations. From eqn (7), we would expect a linear relationship between displ and the product ΠmagΠAR for a system that experiences a constant magnetic field gradient. However, for the system configuration considered here, the magnetic field and gradient are spatially nonlinear (Figure S1(b)). As shown in Fig. 4, this results in the slightly nonlinear relationship, displ ∝ [ΠARΠmag]β, where β is found to be 1.17 by regression. With a powerful tool for the design and analysis of magnetophoretic systems, we next experimentally validate the model and scaling analysis.
From Soup: 53 We next non-dimensionalize the experimental results and plot against the theoretical relationship developed in the previous section. Fig. 5 displays the numerical curve fit from simulated data ( Fig. 4 ) and the experimental solo bead data (Figure S6). The relative uncertainty in Π mag Π AR is approximately 10% and dominated by the distribution in bead radius and uncertainty in the linear flow rate. We can see from Fig. 5 that for low and mid range values of Π mag the experimental data collapses with good agreement onto the theoretical relationship for lateral magnetophoretic deflection. However, for high values of Π mag , the experimental data diverges from the theoretical relationship. In addition, it was observed that at high values of Π mag , as the spread of bead deflections increases, the number of beads imaged ( i.e. , throughput) decreases. For the experimental data being considered, the flow rate is the independent variable and increases in Π mag result from decreasing the flow rate. Imaging the magnet region, we find that as Π mag approaches ≈100 (vertical reference line in Fig. 5 ), a high percentage of the superparamagnetic beads are being “captured.” As predicted theoretically, this approximates the transition from a hydrodynamically dominated regime (deflection) to a magnetically dominated regime (capture). This partial capture causes local aberrations in the magnetic field that result in a decrease in bead throughput as well as spread in the deflection distribution and unpredictable time-varying lateral displacements. Due to a number of the simplifying assumptions incorporated into the numerical model, transition into the magnetic capture regime is not observed in the simulations. Specifically, the model is two- dimensional and ignores the vertical component of the magnetic force. Thus, the model does not apply in the capture regime and will begin to breakdown as Π mag approaches this transition.

From Soup: 54 Following the experimental characterization of solo superparamagnetic bead deflection, we investigate the magnetophoretic displacement of cell-bead complexes. As introduced above, 3.5 μm superparamagnetic beads are functionalized by incubation with biotinylated anti-EpCAM antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and mixed with breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells (American type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA), 9.9 ± 2.1 μm (radius), at ratios of 10 : 1 and 20 : 1. Due to the inherent variability in biological systems, e.g. , EpCAM expression levels, cell size, and the method for mixing , a distribution of cell-bead complexes results, from cells bound by a single bead up to cells bound by nine beads ( Fig. 6 ). Multiple flow rates and magnet angles are also investigated. Again, the ImageJ software is used to measure the cell radius, number of bound beads, and lateral deflection of each cell-bead complex in microscopic images. Fig. 6 displays the data for individual MCF-7 cells bound by superparamagnetic beads. The data are for a single mixing of MCF-7 and superparamagnetic beads (see ESI for details † ) and are grouped by the measured number of bound beads. The distribution in the number of beads per cell seen in Fig. 6 is due to the variability in antigen expression, cell size, and mixing method. The increase in deflection along the theoretical curve for increasing number of bound beads is clearly shown in Fig. 6(b) . As mentioned above, the uncertainty in the displacement measurements is approximately 50 μm and the uncertainty in Π AR Π mag is dominated by the error in the number of bound beads measurement. From each image of the microfluidic channel, the deflection of individual complexes is measured and the number of bound beads is visually counted. This measurement becomes increasingly difficult for higher numbers of beads, i.e. , bead groups may be blocking accurate visualization of additional beads. Due to this, we approximate that the measured number of beads may be up to 20% below the actual value. In Fig. 6(b) , the data points and error bars display the average and standard deviation, respectively, for data grouped by the number of bound beads. As seen with the solo beads, as Π mag approaches and passes ≈100, the transition to magnetic capture begins to cause the results to diverge from the theoretical trend for magnetophoretic deflection. Again, captured solo beads and bead-cell complexes are observed in the magnet region introducing non-uniform magnetic fields.
 ###### 
From cou.: 55 We next non-dimensionalize the experimental results and plot against the theoretical relationship developed in the previous section. Fig. 5 displays the numerical curve fit from simulated data (Fig. 4) and the experimental solo bead data (Figure S6). The relative uncertainty in ΠmagΠAR is approximately 10% and dominated by the distribution in bead radius and uncertainty in the linear flow rate. We can see from Fig. 5 that for low and mid range values of Πmag the experimental data collapses with good agreement onto the theoretical relationship for lateral magnetophoretic deflection. However, for high values of Πmag, the experimental data diverges from the theoretical relationship. In addition, it was observed that at high values of Πmag, as the spread of bead deflections increases, the number of beads imaged (i.e., throughput) decreases. For the experimental data being considered, the flow rate is the independent variable and increases in Πmag result from decreasing the flow rate. Imaging the magnet region, we find that as Πmag approaches ≈100 (vertical reference line in Fig. 5), a high percentage of the superparamagnetic beads are being “captured.” As predicted theoretically, this approximates the transition from a hydrodynamically dominated regime (deflection) to a magnetically dominated regime (capture). This partial capture causes local aberrations in the magnetic field that result in a decrease in bead throughput as well as spread in the deflection distribution and unpredictable time-varying lateral displacements. Due to a number of the simplifying assumptions incorporated into the numerical model, transition into the magnetic capture regime is not observed in the simulations. Specifically, the model is two- dimensional and ignores the vertical component of the magnetic force. Thus, the model does not apply in the capture regime and will begin to breakdown as Πmag approaches this transition.
From Soup: 55 To demonstrate the capture phenomena in terms of the theoretical scaling analysis derived above, the experimental results are plotted on a dimensional force regime map ( Fig. 7 ). Both MCF-7 cell-bead complex data and the solo bead data (plotted as open symbols) are included. The transition from hydrodynamically dominated (magnetic deflection) to magnetically dominated (magnetic capture) is found from the above experimental results to occur for Π AR Π mag ≈ 100. For the general analysis of microfluidic magnetophoresis systems, the regime map displays the overall magnetophoresis design space and provides an overall comparison between the drag and magnetic forces. Lines of constant Π mag radiate out from the origin, increasing with increasing slope. In addition, within each regime, the extent of lateral deflection or percent capture (capture efficiency) can be determined as a function of system and dimensionless parameters, as demonstrated here by the system's deflection curve ( Fig. 4–6 ). As displayed in Fig. 7 , within the magnetically dominated regime, increasing Π mag leads to increasing capture efficiency, 28,32 just as within the hydrodynamically dominated regime, decreasing Π mag leads to decreasing deflection. Therefore, the optimum design and operating conditions for magnetophoretic deflection systems will be high in the hydrodynamically dominated region, but away from the transition to capture ( i.e. , Π mag ≈ 50 to 75).

From Soup: 56 Here, we develop a numerical model for immunomagnetic separation in microfluidic magnetophoresis systems. The model considers the competition between drag and magnetic forces on superparamagnetic beads and more importantly, labeled target cells in a lateral displacement microfluidic system. Incorporating angled magnets and/or arrays of ferromagnetic wires/strips for lateral displacement microfluidics is a growing field. In contrast with channel-flanking magnets, this configuration enables multiplexed operation by the use of multiple angles for precise separation of multiple targets. We employ dimensionless parameters describing the magnetophoretic separation to efficiently investigate the design space and provide general guidelines for device design and optimal operation of the magnetophoresis system. We have numerically demonstrated that the magnetophoretic behavior of solo magnetic beads and various cell-bead complex combinations can all be described by the same set of dimensionless parameters. Expanding this analysis to cell-bead complexes is an important step, due to the distributions found in the extent of labeling for biologically relevant systems. There is inherent variability in the extent of labeling , due to distributions in antigen expression, point in the cell life cycle, cell size, and method of mixing . The scaling analysis and dimensionless parameters provide a regime map of the magnetophoresis system, describing the transition from magnetic deflection (hydrodynamically dominated regime) to magnetic capture (magnetically dominated regime). This powerful tool enables efficient experimental design by identifying the necessary beads, magnet configuration (orientation), magnet type (permanent, ferromagnetic, electromagnet), flow rate, channel geometry, and buffer , needed for a specified capture or deflection all in terms of a single dimensionless parameter. The numerical model and dimensionless parameter relationship are validated by experimental measurements of the magnetophoretic displacement of solo superparamagnetic beads and magnetically labeled breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells. The development of this design tool and the insight gained for the deflection of cell-bead complex distributions provide the foundation on which we will extend immunomagnetic separation and magnetophoretic streamline switching to enrich rare cells from heterogeneous samples, specifically, circulating tumor cells from whole blood. This framework will enable directed immunomagnetic separations established on an expression based spectrum of labeling , thus, facilitating dynamically tunable target purity by sweeping the flow rate.

From Soup: 100 where and χ are the bead volume and effective magnetic susceptibility, and is the permeability of free space. At low Reynolds numbers the inertial effects can be neglected and fully developed laminar flow is assumed. Therefore, Stokes' law is appropriate for determining the drag force on a sphere, as given by, Here, is the effective particle radius, is the fluid viscosity, and is the fluid velocity. Typically a parabolic profile across the channel height is assumed. However, for the low aspect ratio channels considered here, a uniform flow profile (average fluid velocity) across the channel is assumed in order to simplify the model to two-dimensions.
