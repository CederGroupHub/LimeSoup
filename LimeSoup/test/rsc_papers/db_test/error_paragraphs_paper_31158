From cou.: 1 Manganese(II), copper(II) and zinc(II) complexes of four polydentate tripodal ligands (tachpyr (N,N′,N′′-tris(2-pyridylmethyl)-cis,cis-1,3,5-triaminocyclohexane), trenpyr (tris[2-(2-pyridylmethyl)aminoethyl]amine, tach3pyr (N,N′,N′′-tris(3-pyridylmethyl)-cis,cis-1,3,5-triaminocyclohexane) and tren3pyr (tris[2-(2-pyridylmethyl)aminoethyl]amine)) were characterized in both solution and solid states. A combined evaluation of potentiometric, UV-VIS, NMR and EPR data allowed the conclusion of both thermodynamic and structural information about the complexes formed in solution. The four tailored polydentate tripodal ligands studied here exhibit a high thermodynamic stability, and a variety of coordination environments/geometries for the studied transition metal ions. Our data indicate that tachpyr is a more efficient zinc(II) chelator and a similar copper(II) chelator compared to trenpyr. Considering the higher number of N-donors and conformational flexibility of trenpyr, as well as the energy demanding switch to the triaxial conformation required for metal ion binding of tachpyr, the above observation is surprising and is very likely due to the encapsulating effect of the more rigid tachpyr skeleton. This relative binding preference of tachpyr for zinc(II) may be related to the observation that zinc(II) is one of the principal metals targeted by tachpyr in cells. In contrast, trenpyr is a considerably more efficient manganese(II) chelator, since it acts as a heptadentate ligand in the aqueous Mn(trenpyr) complex. The crystal structures of copper(II) and zinc(II) complexes of tachpyr indicated important differences in the ligand conformation, induced by the position of counter ions, as compared to earlier reports. The closely related new ligands, tach3pyr and tren3pyr, have been designed to form oligonuclear complexes. Indeed, we obtained a three dimensional polymer with a copper(II)/tren3pyr ratio of 11/6. Within this metal–organic framework, three distinctly different copper geometries can be identified: square pyramidal, trigonal bipyramidal and tetrahedral. Two square pyramidal and four trigonal bipyramidal copper centres create a hexanuclear subunit with a large inside cavity. These moieties are linked by tetrahedral copper(II) centres, constructing the three-dimensional polymer structure. The formation of such polynuclear complexes was not detected in solution. Both tach3pyr and tren3pyr form only mononuclear complexes with square pyramidal and trigonal bipyramidal geometries, respectively.

From cou.: 2 The favourable and preorganized spatial distribution of donor atoms in tripodal ligands has been for a long time recognised1 and applied to develop for example, structural/functional models of metalloproteins2–6 or supramolecular assemblies.7 Polydentate (n > 4) tripodal ligands are generally synthesized by the derivatization of (tri/tetra)dentate tripodal platforms, such as cis,cis-1,3,5-triaminocyclohexane (tach), tris-(2-aminoethyl)amine (tren) or nitrilotriacetic acid (nta). Such modifications may provide additional donor site(s), may influence the steric environment around the metal centre or may help introduce further metal binding site(s) in order to create polynuclear complexes. Accordingly, these polydentate tripodal ligands are efficient metal sequestering agents,8 artificial receptors,9 metal ion sensors10 or artificial enzymes.11,12

From cou.: 3 Tachpyr (N,N′,N′′-tris(2-pyridylmethyl)-cis,cis-1,3,5-triaminocyclohexane) and trenpyr (tris[2-(2-pyridylmethyl)aminoethyl]amine) are versatile polydentate tripodal ligands (Scheme 1). Tachpyr and trenpyr bind strongly to most transition metal ions.13–22 The Fe(II/III) and Mn(II/III) complexes of trenpyr are highly active SOD-mimicking compounds.13,14 Tachpyr and some of its derivatives are promising chelators of 64/67Cu for radiotherapeutic uses.23,24 Moreover, both tachpyr and trenpyr, as well as some of their methyl-substituted analogues, are cytotoxic metal chelators with potential anti-tumor activity.17,25–28 Tachpyr induces inhibition of ferritin synthesis,25 and triggers activation of CHK kinases, leading to cell-cycle arrest in G2, a radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle.26 The intracellular chelation of zinc as well as iron, but not copper, may play a fundamental role in the apoptosis induced by tachpyr and its derivatives. Accordingly, the apoptotic caspases 9 and 3 were blocked in cells pre-treated with either iron or zinc.27,28

From cou.: 4 Although both tachpyr and trenpyr have been designed for efficient metal ion binding, and a number of crystal structures are available for their metal complexes,13–22 thermodynamic data on the stability of these complexes are very scarce. To our knowledge, no solution equilibrium or detailed solution structural study is reported for tachpyr, and in the case of trenpyr stability constants are available only for the Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes at I = 1 M.20,21

From cou.: 5 Due to the favourable position of pyridine nitrogens of tachpyr and trenpyr, these ligands encapsulate the metal ions by fused chelate rings, which is probably one of the main reasons for their efficient metal binding ability. This encapsulating effect is not present in the case of 3-pyridylmethyl-substituted derivatives of tach and tren (tach3pyr and tren3pyr, see Scheme 1). Although the positions of pyridine nitrogens in these ligands are not appropriate for the coordination to metal ions already bound to the tripodal platform, it may be advantageous in the construction of oligonuclear complexes. Indeed, the position of the pyridine nitrogens in tach3pyr and tren3pyr may allow the formation of supramolecular structures or metal–organic frameworks. In addition, the steric and aromatic properties of pyridine rings of tach3pyr and tren3pyr can be also advantageous to develop enzyme mimics. The Cu(tach)(OH) complex is an efficient model of hydrolytic enzymes,29–32 but it readily transforms into the inactive dihydroxo-bridged [Cu2(tach)2(OH)2] dimer.29N-Alkylation of tach suppresses the formation of inactive dimer species, therefore these complexes efficiently promote the hydrolysis of both bis(4-nitrophenyl)phosphate (bnpp)33 and DNA.32 In the Cu(II)-tach3pyr system, the formation of the inactive dimer would be unfavourable, too, and the non-coordinating pyridine rings may enhance the substrate binding to the hydrolytically active species.

From cou.: 8 Tachpyr was prepared by a slight modification of the previously reported method.34 Tach(HBr)3 (1.032 g, 2.775 mmol) was dissolved in H2O (5 mL) with NaOH (0.333 g, 8.325 mmol) to form a clear solution. Benzene (100 mL) was added and the water was removed by azeotropic distillation with a Dean–Stark trap. Pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde (0.905 g, 8.45 mmol) was added during this process. After 24 h reflux the solvent was evaporated. The resulting white imine was dissolved in MeOH (40 mL) and NaBH4 (1.09 g, 29 mmol) was added in small portions. The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h, then the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The residue was dissolved in CHCl3 (40 mL) and stirred vigorously with a 40 mL 5% aqueous NaHCO3 solution. The layers were separated, and the CHCl3 solution was further washed with saturated NaCl solutions (2 × 40 mL), then dried over Na2SO4. After the filtration, the organic phase was treated with dry HCl gas to form the hydrochloric salt of the ligand (tachpyr·4HCl). The product was washed with CHCl3 (60 mL) and dry Et2O (60 mL), (1.37 g, 92%).

The EPR spectra were recorded in aqueous solution (or in 60% (w/w) dmso–water), and were simulated by a spectral decomposition algorithm.41 Since the copper(II) salt used to make the stock solution was a natural mixture of isotopes, the spectrum of each species was calculated as the sum of spectra containing 63Cu and 65Cu weighed by their natural abundance. The copper and ligand coupling constants are given in units of gauss (1 G = 10−4 T).
From Soup: 23 The reaction was performed in 60% (w/w) dmso–water ( I = 0.1 M NaCl, T = 298 K). The increase in the absorbance maximum at 405 nm of the p -nitrophenolate anion ( ε = 18 900 M −1 cm −1 ) was monitored in a buffered solution (20 mM CHES or HEPES). The p K of p -nitrophenol was determined independently for our conditions (p K = 7.50 ± 0.05). The initial concentration of bnpp varied from 0.5 mM to 6.5 mM. The initial slope method (∼4% conversion) was used to determine the pseudo first-order rate constants. The reported data are the average of triplicate measurements (reproducibility ∼10%).

From Soup: 30 For conformational comparison, the root mean square of the distances between the pair of atoms (RMSD) and maximum difference (max.D) was calculated by using the Mercury program. 49 The closest geometrical similarity is between 3 and CAFXEN (RMSD = 0.042 and max.D = 0.089), but high similarities are between 1 / 3 (RMSD = 0.124 and max.D = 0.220) and 2 /DOSVAI (RMSD = 0.172 and max.D = 0.267), too. Despite the conformational and cell similarities (cell similarity index 51,52 = 0.00566), the relatively low isostructurality index 51,52 (68.4%) suggests that the position of the complexes is slightly shifted in 3 as compared to CAFXEN. The cell similarity and isostructurality indices are somewhat higher for structures 1 / 3 (0.0072 and 82.1%, respectively). The calculation of these indices can be found in the legend of Fig. S3. †

From Soup: 31 For comparison, some selected bond lengths and angles together with angles between different ring planes are collected in Table 2 . The asymmetric pyridine arms resulted in three significantly different Zn–N pyr bond distances and N pyr –Zn–N pyr angles for [Zn(tachpyr)] in crystal 1 . Similarly, different angles can be measured between the ring planes ( Table 2 ) in this complex. The twist angle ( α ) ( Fig. 2 ) defined for the comparison of a [M(tachpyr)] coordination sphere 15,18 also shows significant difference in the conformation of the three arms. Though in crystal 2 and DOSVAI the [Zn(tachpyr)] complex has the same C 3 symmetry, the Zn–N pyr bond distance is significantly longer and the twist angle is smaller for 2 than for DOSVAI ( Table 2 and Fig. 1 ). The positions of the counter ions around the metal complexes are accounted for the conformational differences. In crystal 2 the perchlorate anions positioned exactly on the C 3 axis, above the pyridine rings of tachpyr, however in DOSVAI they localized aside of the pyridine rings (Fig. S4 and S5 † ). In crystals 1 , 3 and CAFXEN the perchlorate anions are in different hydrogen bond connections with the three pyridine arms (Fig. S5 † ).

From Soup: 33 In the solid state tren3pyr forms a 3D metal–organic framework (MOF) with copper( II ). This is the first published crystal structure with the novel tren3pyr ligand. The cubic structure is based on a distinct copper( II ) containing secondary building units (SBU) in the nodes and (3-pyridylmethyl)amino groups at the edges forming a high symmetry MOF. The formation of this MOF is explained by the strong metal binding ability of all nitrogens of tren3pyr, and by the position of pyridine nitrogens, which are not able to form chelate rings with the secondary/tertiary amines. In this way, all tren3pyr molecules are bound to four different copper( II ) ions ( Fig. 3a and 4b ). This structural feature results in the formation of an infinite (Cu 11 L 6 ) n polymer, in which each copper( II ) has a coordinated chloride, and the counter ions are also chlorides. Two of these polymers create an interpenetrated network in the crystal structure. Beside the rigid framework, more than 20% of the unit cell volume consists of separated voids (Fig. S6 † ). In these cavities the remaining electron density could be well modelled by chloride ions, solvent ethanol and water molecules hence the void volume of the unit cell is 1.7% and 326 Å 3 in the refined complete structure.

From Soup: 34 Within this metal–organic framework three distinctly different copper centres or SBUs can be identified. The first one has a slightly distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry ( τ = 0.885), and this type of copper is bound to all tren-like moieties ( Fig. 3a ). The second has a nearly perfect square pyramidal geometry ( τ = 0.053) with four pyridine nitrogens in its basal plane ( Fig. 3b ). The distance of the metal ion from the mean plane of the four nitrogens is 0.3 Å. All pyridine rings originated from different ligand molecules, i.e. this copper( II ) centre connects four type 1 SBUs, and is therefore responsible for the formation of the hexanuclear subunits with a large inside cavity ( Fig. 4 and Fig. S6 † ). The third type of copper centre has a distorted tetrahedral geometry ( Fig. 3c ) constituted by three pyridine nitrogens and a chloride ion. The distances between the metal ion and the centroid of the tetragon to the N3 plane are 0.4 and 0.7 Å, respectively. The three coordinated pyridine rings belong to three different hexanuclear subunits, consequently these copper centres create the 3D MOF. Two of these 3D polymers are interlaced and form an interpenetrated network with a special topology in the crystal structure (Fig. 6S † ).

Selected data for the coordination are shown in Table 3 , some of the values are equal because of the lattice symmetry. The shortest Cu⋯Cu distances are 6.796 Å.

From Soup: 38 Since an unusual sequence of protonation has been reported for the amine and pyridine nitrogens of trenpyr, 20 we supplemented our pH-potentiometric data by pH-dependent 1 H NMR studies. As the pH-dependence of the proton NMR signals of tachpyr, tach3pyr and tren3pyr clearly indicate (Fig. S1 and S2 in ESI † ), the secondary amino groups (p K NH ≥ 5) are in all cases more basic than the pyridine nitrogens. In fact, only one pyridine p K can be determined by pH-potentiometry for tachpyr and trenpyr ( Table 4 ), the others are deprotonated already at the beginning of potentiometric titrations (pH ∼ 1.8). Consequently, the average p K s of pyridine nitrogens are considerably higher for tach3pyr and tren3pyr than for the 2-pyridylmethyl-derivatives (Δp K > 1.5), which is probably related to the strong intramolecular H-bonds formed within tachpyr and trenpyr. As reflected by our 1 H NMR study (Fig. S2 † ), the tertiary nitrogen of tren3pyr is not protonated between pH 2–11, due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the three protonated legs.

From Soup: 40 The formation constants of Mn( II ), Cu( II ) and Zn( II ) complexes are listed in Table 5 . According to the presence of 6/7 nitrogen donors in tachpyr/trenpyr, the stability of their metal complexes is very high. In the copper( II ) containing systems the concentration of free (uncomplexed) metal ions is low even at the beginning of titrations (pH ∼ 1.7), therefore the acquisition of independent spectrophotometric data was necessary to determine the correct formation constants. The equilibrium study was further complicated by the slow kinetics in the copper( II )– and zinc( II )–tachpyr systems, which was found to be strongly pH dependent. In the zinc( II )–tachpyr system the equilibrium was attained within 10–20 minutes at any pH, but the formation and especially the dissociation of copper( II ) complexes (see e.g. Fig. 7 ) needed considerably more time above pH ∼ 1.5.

The estimated errors of the formation constants were increased ±0.2 due to the uncertainties induced by I > 0.1 M at the acidic end of the titration. The speciation of the Cu(Htachpyr) complex shows a maximum around pH 1.7, while Cu(tachpyr) is the sole species in the solution above pH 4 ( Fig. 6 ). The pH-dependent Vis/NIR and EPR spectra of the copper( II )–tachpyr system are depicted in Fig. 6 and 7 . In Cu(Htachpyz) one of the secondary amino groups is still protonated, i.e. the metal ion is either 4N or 5N coordinated. The Vis/NIR spectrum detected around pH 1.7 ( Fig. 5 ) shows a transition at 620 nm with a relatively strong low-energy shoulder at 840 nm, indicating a square pyramidal geometry with a strong apical coordination, similarly to the copper( II ) complexes of several related tach derivatives. 12,17,59

The basicity corrected formation constants of the Cu(Htachpyr) and Cu(Htach) complexes allow an approximate comparison of their stability (log β * = log β 111 − (log β 01(4/3) − log β 011 ) = 8.08 and 0.23 for tachpyr and tach, respectively, Table 5 ). Considering the nearly eight orders of magnitude difference, the Cu(Htachpyz) complex is very likely 5N coordinated.
 ###### 
From cou.: 43 The formation constants of the Cu(Htachpyr) and Cu(tachpyr) complexes (Table 5) were determined by pH-dependent spectrophotometric titration (Fig. 5), allowing 6 days for equilibration. The estimated errors of the formation constants were increased ±0.2 due to the uncertainties induced by I > 0.1 M at the acidic end of the titration. The speciation of the Cu(Htachpyr) complex shows a maximum around pH 1.7, while Cu(tachpyr) is the sole species in the solution above pH 4 (Fig. 6). The pH-dependent Vis/NIR and EPR spectra of the copper(II)–tachpyr system are depicted in Fig. 6 and 7. In Cu(Htachpyz) one of the secondary amino groups is still protonated, i.e. the metal ion is either 4N or 5N coordinated. The Vis/NIR spectrum detected around pH 1.7 (Fig. 5) shows a transition at 620 nm with a relatively strong low-energy shoulder at 840 nm, indicating a square pyramidal geometry with a strong apical coordination, similarly to the copper(II) complexes of several related tach derivatives.12,17,59
From Soup: 43 The formation of Cu(tachpyr) results in a red shift of d–d bands (620 nm → 650 nm, 840 nm → 940 nm), indicating an even stronger coordination along the z -axis. 60 This is also confirmed by the nearly 13 orders of magnitude difference in the basicity corrected formation constants of Cu(tachpyr) and Cu(tach) (log β * = log β 101 − log β 01(4/3) = −2.3 and −15.07 for tachpyr and tach, respectively, Table 5 ). The complex Cu(tachpyr) has higher g and smaller A values as compared to its protonated form ( Table 6 ), which also suggests stronger axial binding, i.e. 6N coordination in a distorted octahedral environment, as was observed in the crystal structure of complex 3 . The broad room temperature spectra of this complex ( Fig. 7A ) are probably due to the dynamic Jahn–Teller effect, which is known to operate in 6N-coordinated copper( II ) complexes. 61
 ###### 
From cou.: 44 The EPR spectrum recorded in acidic solution (Fig. 7, Table 6) is also consistent with a distorted square pyramidal structure. The basicity corrected formation constants of the Cu(Htachpyr) and Cu(Htach) complexes allow an approximate comparison of their stability (logβ* = logβ111 − (logβ01(4/3) − logβ011) = 8.08 and 0.23 for tachpyr and tach, respectively, Table 5). Considering the nearly eight orders of magnitude difference, the Cu(Htachpyz) complex is very likely 5N coordinated.
From Soup: 44 In the zinc( II )–tachpyr system two complexes can be identified too ( Fig. 6 ). The species Zn(Htachpyr) is only a minor complex around pH 3, and Zn(tachpyr) is a dominant one above pH 5, which indicates high thermodynamic stability. Indeed, its basicity corrected stability constant is 12 orders of magnitude higher than that of the corresponding Zn(tach) complex ( Tables 4 and 5 ). The ligand exchange process of Zn(tachpyr) is slow on the NMR time-scale ( Fig. 8 ). The important differences in the spin coupling pattern between the free and bound ligands (considerably decreased coupling constants between the CH and CH 2 protons of the cyclohexane ring, which results in a broad singlet and two doublets, respectively), clearly show the switch between the two chair conformations (triequatorial NH → triaxial NH). 62 Although the triaxial conformer is energetically unfavoured in the free ligand, it is the preferred one in metal complexes of all tach derivatives. 15–19,63 In accordance with earlier reports, 15 the single set of signals observed for this slow exchanging species indicate a C 3 symmetry, the chemical inequivalence of benzylic protons (∼4.16 ppm) shows conformational rigidity even within the 2-pyridylmethyl arms. All these facts, together with the significant chemical shift difference of protons close to the nitrogen atoms in the bound and unbound ligands ( Fig. 9 ) suggest tight 6N-coordination around zinc( II ), as seen in the crystal structures of 1 and 2 .

From Soup: 45 An earlier RP-HPLC study on the aqueous Mn( II )–tachpyr system indicated nearly complete dissociation at pH 5.5. 15 In agreement with this finding, our potentiometric data indicated that the formation of Mn(Htachpyr) and Mn(tachpyr) started at pH 4.6 (at metal ion and ligand concentrations of 2 mM), and the latter species is the sole complex only above pH 8 ( Fig. 6 ). Consequently, the Mn(tachpyr) complex is considerably less stable than the corresponding copper( II ) or zinc( II ) species (Δlog β 101 = 13.21 and 8.66, respectively). This is in accordance with the Irwing–Williams series, although the complete transformation of Mn( II )(aq) into Mn(tachpyr) at pH 8 in equimolar solution confirms the high metal ion sequestering ability of tachpyr.

From Soup: 46 The formation constants of copper( II )– and zinc( II )–trenpyr complexes have been already published for the 1 M KNO 3 background electrolyte. 20,21 In order to have comparable data with other formation constants reported in this work, we repeated the solution equilibrium study of these systems in 0.1 M NaCl solutions, and complemented it by pH-dependent Vis/NIR and 1 H NMR studies. The formation constants of the Cu(Htrenpyr) and Cu(trenpyr) complexes ( Table 5 ) were determined by pH-dependent spectrophotometric titration ( Fig. 9 ). Since slow kinetics, comparable with the Cu( II )-tachpyr system, was not observed, the stability of the Cu(trenpyr) complex was also determined by the ligand displacement method at pH 10 using diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (dtpa) (Fig. S7 † ). The formation constants determined by the two methods are in agreement with each other within ±0.1 log units ( Table 5 ).

From Soup: 47 In our background electrolyte, too, Cu(Htrenpyr) and Cu(trenpyr) are the unique species between pH 2–4 and 7–11, respectively ( Fig. 10 ). Taking into account the ionic strength difference, our formation constants ( Table 5 ) are in good agreement with those reported earlier. 21 The Vis/NIR spectrum of Cu(Htrenpyr) is close to that of Cu(Htachpyr), including the low energy transitions around 850 nm, indicating a square pyramidal geometry in both species. On the other hand, the spectrum of Cu(trenpyr) ( λ d–d max = 650 and 720 nm with nearly equal intensities, Fig. 9 ) is completely different from that of the 6N coordinated Cu(tachpyr), and indicates an intermediate geometry between square pyramidal and trigonal bipyramidal. 64,65
 ###### 
From cou.: 48 The formation constants of copper(II)– and zinc(II)–trenpyr complexes have been already published for the 1 M KNO3 background electrolyte.20,21 In order to have comparable data with other formation constants reported in this work, we repeated the solution equilibrium study of these systems in 0.1 M NaCl solutions, and complemented it by pH-dependent Vis/NIR and 1H NMR studies. The formation constants of the Cu(Htrenpyr) and Cu(trenpyr) complexes (Table 5) were determined by pH-dependent spectrophotometric titration (Fig. 9).

From Soup: 48 In the presence of zinc( II ), the formation of Zn(H 2 trenpyr), Zn(Htrenpyr) and Zn(trenpyr) was detected, similarly to the earlier report. 20 Zn(Htrenpyr) is a dominant species at pH 4, its deprotonation is complete at pH 7. The 1 H NMR data revealed a slow ligand exchange on the NMR time-scale for both Zn(Htrenpyr) and Zn(trenpyr) complexes ( Fig. 11 ). The proton signals, especially the methylene protons of Zn(Htrenpyr), are considerably broadened. Since the signals of the free ligand are sharp in the Zn( II )–trenpyr system at any pH, the observed broadening for Zn(Htrenpyr) is due to the conformational changes, likely induced by intramolecular proton-transfer processes, i.e. the proton ‘hops’ between the secondary nitrogens.
 ###### 
From cou.: 49 In our background electrolyte, too, Cu(Htrenpyr) and Cu(trenpyr) are the unique species between pH 2–4 and 7–11, respectively (Fig. 10). Taking into account the ionic strength difference, our formation constants (Table 5) are in good agreement with those reported earlier.21 The Vis/NIR spectrum of Cu(Htrenpyr) is close to that of Cu(Htachpyr), including the low energy transitions around 850 nm, indicating a square pyramidal geometry in both species.

From Soup: 49 The signals belonging to the Zn(trenpyr) complex are rather sharp ( Fig. 11 ). Since in the crystal structure of [Zn(trenpyr)](ClO 4 ) 2 one of the pyridine rings is not coordinated, and therefore the ligand is asymmetrically bound, 20 it is surprising that only one set of signals is present for the three ‘legs’ on the NMR spectrum of the slow exchanging Zn(trenpyr). This indicates C 3 symmetry of the complex, and either seven-coordinated {N tert ,3NH,3N pyr } or six-coordinated {3NH,3N pyr } type binding mode of trenpyr. In the case of zinc( II ) the latter is more likely, and this binding mode is present in the Zn( II ) complex of the closely related Schiff-base derivative of trenpyr. 66 Furthermore, the aromatic protons beside the pyridine N (C 6 H), despite the expectations, are considerably more upfield shifted (7.48 ppm) in Zn(Htrenpyr) than in Zn(trenpyr) (8.07 ppm), which indicates notable changes in the coordination environment of zinc( II ) during the deprotonation. All these facts may support the {3NH,3N pyr } type coordination in Zn(trenpyr).
 ###### 
From cou.: 50 In the presence of zinc(II), the formation of Zn(H2trenpyr), Zn(Htrenpyr) and Zn(trenpyr) was detected, similarly to the earlier report.20 Zn(Htrenpyr) is a dominant species at pH 4, its deprotonation is complete at pH 7. The 1H NMR data revealed a slow ligand exchange on the NMR time-scale for both Zn(Htrenpyr) and Zn(trenpyr) complexes (Fig. 11). The proton signals, especially the methylene protons of Zn(Htrenpyr), are considerably broadened.

From Soup: 50 In the presence of manganese( II ) only two species were detected ( Fig. 9 ). The complex Mn(Htrenpyr) is a minor complex around pH 5, its deprotonation results in Mn(trenpyr), which is the sole species above pH 7 (at metal ion and ligand concentrations of 2 mM).
 ###### 
From cou.: 51 The signals belonging to the Zn(trenpyr) complex are rather sharp (Fig. 11). Since in the crystal structure of [Zn(trenpyr)](ClO4)2 one of the pyridine rings is not coordinated, and therefore the ligand is asymmetrically bound,20 it is surprising that only one set of signals is present for the three ‘legs’ on the NMR spectrum of the slow exchanging Zn(trenpyr). This indicates C3 symmetry of the complex, and either seven-coordinated {Ntert,3NH,3Npyr} or six-coordinated {3NH,3Npyr} type binding mode of trenpyr. In the case of zinc(II) the latter is more likely, and this binding mode is present in the Zn(II) complex of the closely related Schiff-base derivative of trenpyr.66 Furthermore, the aromatic protons beside the pyridine N (C6H), despite the expectations, are considerably more upfield shifted (7.48 ppm) in Zn(Htrenpyr) than in Zn(trenpyr) (8.07 ppm), which indicates notable changes in the coordination environment of zinc(II) during the deprotonation. All these facts may support the {3NH,3Npyr} type coordination in Zn(trenpyr).
From Soup: 51 The significant differences between the deprotonation of CuHL/ZnHL complexes of tachpyr and trenpyr are noteworthy (compare Fig. 6 and 10 ), which, however, does not apply for the MnHL species. This is due to the different denticity of tachpyr and trenpyr, as well as the different coordination geometries of their metal complexes. In the case of tachpyr complexes, the deprotonation of the 5N coordinated MHL complexes results in the increase of coordinated nitrogen donors, i.e. the metal promoted deprotonation is favoured. In contrast, in the copper( II )– and zinc( II )–trenpyr complexes, the coordination number is unchanged during the MHL → ML deprotonation, therefore it is less favoured since the incoming secondary NH should displace an already bound nitrogen from the coordination sphere. On the other hand, our equilibrium data indicate that the process M(Htrenpyr) = M(trenpyr) + H + is more favoured for Mn( II ) than for Zn( II ) or Cu( II ) (p K = 5.08, 5.23 and 5.56, respectively), despite the striking differences in the stability of the corresponding M(trenpyr) complexes ( Table 5 ). Since manganese( II ) is the weakest Lewis-acid among these metal ions, the above order of p K s is unusual, and suggests that the coordination of the secondary NH-group induces some additional stabilization in the case of Mn( II ). In this respect, it is worth noting that in the crystal structure of [Mn(trenpyr)](PF 6 ) 2 the metal ion is seven coordinated. 14 The above mentioned additional stabilization is most likely provided by the chelate coordination of the third NH-group and pyridine nitrogen on the same ‘leg’, i.e. the complex Mn(trenpyr) is probably seven-coordinated ({N tert ,3NH,3N pyr }) in solution, too.

From Soup: 52 The basicity corrected formation constants allow an approximate comparison of M(tachpyr)/M(tach) or M(trenpyr)/M(tren) complexes, but it would provide erroneous results in the case of M(tachpyr)/M(trenpyr) pairs. It is more appropriate to calculate the conditional stability constants at a given pH ( K cond (pH) = ∑[MH x L]/([M 2+ ] free × (∑[H x L] free )) in order to compare their metal ion binding abilities. In the case of tachpyr log K cond (pH 7.4) = 18.9, 14.0 and 5.3 for copper( II ), zinc( II ) and manganese( II ), respectively. The analogous values for trenpyr are log K cond (pH 7.4) = 19.1, 13.4 and 8.4, respectively. These data indicate that tachpyr is a more efficient zinc( II ) chelator, a nearly similar copper( II ) chelator, and a less efficient manganese( II ) chelator than trenpyr. Considering the energy demanding switch between the (triequatorial NH → triaxial NH) conformations of tachpyr and the conformational flexibility of trenpyr, these data are somewhat surprising, and is very likely due to the encapsulating effect of the more rigid tachpyr skeleton. On the other hand, the observed relative binding preference of tachpyr for zinc( II ) is probably related to the observation that zinc( II ) is one of the principal metals targeted by tachpyr in cells. 27

From Soup: 54 The formation constants determined for the manganese( II ), copper( II ) and zinc( II ) complexes are listed in Table 4 . In aqueous solution precipitate formation was observed for the M( II )–tach3pyr systems at pH 6.5 (Cu( II )), 7.5 (Zn( II )) and 8.5 (Mn( II )). Up to these pH values only the M(Htach3pyr) and M(tach3pyr) complexes were detected, but none of them were dominant species before the precipitation occurred.

In a 60% (w/w) dmso–water mixed solvent the copper( II )–tach3pyr systems were clear up to pH 10. Although, in the presence of zinc( II ) a precipitate was observed, too, further investigations were performed in this medium.

From Soup: 57 As expected, the presence of 3-pyridylmethyl legs prevent the formation of the dihydroxo-bridged dicopper complex formed with tach, 29 and above pH 7 two mononuclear mixed hydroxo-complexes (Cu(tach3pyr)(OH) and Cu(tach3pyr)(OH) 2 ) are formed ( Fig. 12 ). The deprotonation of the coordinated water molecules (p K = 7.94 and 9.77) resulted in a slight blue-shift of the Vis/NIR (Cu(tach3pyr)(OH): 650 and ∼900 nm; Cu(tach3pyr)(OH) 2 : 640 and ∼900 nm) and EPR spectra ( Table 6 and Fig. S9 † ), suggesting that the square pyramidal geometry is retained in these species, too.

From Soup: 58 The relatively open coordination sphere of Cu(tach3pyr)(OH) species is favourable from the point of view of hydrolytic catalysis. Indeed, we observed a notable hydrolytic activity for the mono-hydroxo species against bis( p -nitrophenyl) phosphate (bnpp), an activated phosphodiester ( Fig. 12 ). The water molecule in the fifth position of copper( II ) can be easily replaced by the substrate, and the copper-bound hydroxide ion may act as an intramolecular nucleophile (Fig. S10 † ). The initial rate of hydrolysis as a function of bnpp concentration (Fig. S11 † ) shows saturation kinetics. The treatment of these data, using the Michaelis–Menten model, yielded the following parameters: k cat = (3.0 ± 0.4) × 10 −5 s −1 and K M = (4.2 ± 0.8) mM (Fig. S11 † ). It is rather difficult to compare these values with those of the related copper( II ) complex of N , N ′, N ′′-trimethyl- cis , cis -1,3,5-triaminocyclohexane, 33 due to the different temperature and solvent used, as well as the unlike mechanism. Although it seems that the Cu(tach3pyr)(OH) species is somewhat more active, the above K M value does not indicate a notable increase of substrate binding due to the expected π–π interaction between pyridyl and nitrophenyl rings. Therefore, further kinetic studies were not performed.

The deprotonation of the coordinated water molecules (pK = 7.94 and 9.77) resulted in a slight blue-shift of the Vis/NIR (Cu(tach3pyr)(OH): 650 and ∼900 nm; Cu(tach3pyr)(OH)2: 640 and ∼900 nm) and EPR spectra (Table 6 and Fig. S9†), suggesting that the square pyramidal geometry is retained in these species, too.
From Soup: 59 Tren3pyr forms more stable complexes with copper( II ) and zinc( II ) than tach3pyr ( Table 5 ), due to the four available nitrogens for metal ion binding of the tripodal platform. In the solution containing copper( II ) and tren3pyr only mononuclear complexes (Cu(H x tren3pyr), x = 3, 2, 1, 0, −1) have been observed ( Fig. 13 ). At twofold metal ion excess over tren3pyr, a precipitate was detected at pH 4–5, which prevented the equilibrium study. The precipitate was than recrystallized from ethanol to obtain complex 4 . In equimolar solutions, precipitation and formation of polymeric species were not observed at 298 K, only mononuclear complexes were detected (see the MS spectrum in Fig. S12 † ).

From cou.: 60 The relatively open coordination sphere of Cu(tach3pyr)(OH) species is favourable from the point of view of hydrolytic catalysis. Indeed, we observed a notable hydrolytic activity for the mono-hydroxo species against bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (bnpp), an activated phosphodiester (Fig. 12).

The treatment of these data, using the Michaelis–Menten model, yielded the following parameters: kcat = (3.0 ± 0.4) × 10−5 s−1 and KM = (4.2 ± 0.8) mM (Fig. S11†). It is rather difficult to compare these values with those of the related copper(II) complex of N,N′,N′′-trimethyl-cis,cis-1,3,5-triaminocyclohexane,33 due to the different temperature and solvent used, as well as the unlike mechanism. Although it seems that the Cu(tach3pyr)(OH) species is somewhat more active, the above KM value does not indicate a notable increase of substrate binding due to the expected π–π interaction between pyridyl and nitrophenyl rings. Therefore, further kinetic studies were not performed.
From Soup: 60 According to the relatively high stability of tren3pyr complexes, their formation start at pH 2 and after three overlapped deprotonations the Cu(tren3pyr) species formed, a dominant complex around pH 7 ( Fig. 13 ). During these processes, the Vis/NIR spectra show gradually increasing d–d bands at 870 nm with a shoulder at 700 nm ( Fig. 14 ). The calculated individual spectra of these complexes (Fig. S13 † ) indicate invariable band positions.
 ###### 
From cou.: 61 Tren3pyr forms more stable complexes with copper(II) and zinc(II) than tach3pyr (Table 5), due to the four available nitrogens for metal ion binding of the tripodal platform. In the solution containing copper(II) and tren3pyr only mononuclear complexes (Cu(Hxtren3pyr), x = 3, 2, 1, 0, −1) have been observed (Fig. 13). At twofold metal ion excess over tren3pyr, a precipitate was detected at pH 4–5, which prevented the equilibrium study. The precipitate was than recrystallized from ethanol to obtain complex 4. In equimolar solutions, precipitation and formation of polymeric species were not observed at 298 K, only mononuclear complexes were detected (see the MS spectrum in Fig. S12†).
From Soup: 61 The room temperature EPR spectra are also identical between pH 2–7 ( Table 6 , Fig. S14 † ). Although, the parameters of EPR spectra measured at 77 K ( Fig. 15 ) show some subtle variations with pH ( Table 6 ), they are essentially similar. Both the typical d–d bands and the ‘reversed’ order of g -values ( g z < g x ∼ g y ( Table 6 ), i.e. the complexes have a ground state with an unpaired electron in the d z 2 orbital 67 ) indicate a trigonal bipyramidal geometry in Cu(H x tren3pyr), x = 3, 2, 1, 0. It means that the metal ion is bound to the four nitrogens of the tren-like subunit already in Cu(H 3 tren3pyr), and the successive deprotonations are related to non-coordinating pyridine rings. Although, the p K values of these deprotonations (p K = 3.79, 4.17 and 4.76) are somewhat higher than those of the free ligand ( Table 4 ), this is due to the higher electron withdrawing effect of the protonated secondary amino nitrogens as compared to the neutral (and metal ion coordinated) ones.
 ###### 
From cou.: 62 According to the relatively high stability of tren3pyr complexes, their formation start at pH 2 and after three overlapped deprotonations the Cu(tren3pyr) species formed, a dominant complex around pH 7 (Fig. 13). During these processes, the Vis/NIR spectra show gradually increasing d–d bands at 870 nm with a shoulder at 700 nm (Fig. 14). The calculated individual spectra of these complexes (Fig. S13†) indicate invariable band positions.
From Soup: 62 The low temperature EPR spectra indicate the presence of two additional species, which appeared during the fast-freezing process. Between pH 2.5–3.2 a weak axial spectrum (d x 2 − y 2 ground state, g ⊥ > g ‖ , Table 6 ) can be detected which probably belongs to Cu(H 4 tren3pyr), undetectable at room temperature. The other appeared between pH 3.5–5 as a broad isotropic signal, due to a small amount (20%) of magnetically coupled copper( II ) centres. This is probably related to the polynuclear complex 4 , which became thermodynamically more stable at low temperature.

From cou.: 63 The room temperature EPR spectra are also identical between pH 2–7 (Table 6, Fig. S14†). Although, the parameters of EPR spectra measured at 77 K (Fig. 15) show some subtle variations with pH (Table 6), they are essentially similar. Both the typical d–d bands and the ‘reversed’ order of g-values (gz < gx ∼ gy (Table 6), i.e. the complexes have a ground state with an unpaired electron in the dz2 orbital67) indicate a trigonal bipyramidal geometry in Cu(Hxtren3pyr), x = 3, 2, 1, 0. It means that the metal ion is bound to the four nitrogens of the tren-like subunit already in Cu(H3tren3pyr), and the successive deprotonations are related to non-coordinating pyridine rings. Although, the pK values of these deprotonations (pK = 3.79, 4.17 and 4.76) are somewhat higher than those of the free ligand (Table 4), this is due to the higher electron withdrawing effect of the protonated secondary amino nitrogens as compared to the neutral (and metal ion coordinated) ones.
From Soup: 63 Above pH 7 a single deprotonation was observed which resulted in the formation of Cu(tren3pyr)(OH). Both Vis/NIR and EPR spectra ( Fig. 14 and 15 ) show considerable differences between Cu(tren3pyr) and Cu(tren3pyr)(OH), although the typical features of a trigonal bipyramidal geometry are retained. The low temperature EPR parameters ( Table 6 ) indicate the absence of rhombic distortion (a more symmetric coordination environment) in the xy -plane of the mixed hydroxo complex.

From cou.: 64 The low temperature EPR spectra indicate the presence of two additional species, which appeared during the fast-freezing process. Between pH 2.5–3.2 a weak axial spectrum (dx2−y2 ground state, g⊥ > g‖, Table 6) can be detected which probably belongs to Cu(H4tren3pyr), undetectable at room temperature. The other appeared between pH 3.5–5 as a broad isotropic signal, due to a small amount (20%) of magnetically coupled copper(II) centres. This is probably related to the polynuclear complex 4, which became thermodynamically more stable at low temperature.
From Soup: 64 In the presence of zinc( II ) two major species form, Zn(tren3pyr) between pH 6–8 and Zn(tren3pyr)(OH) above pH 8 (Fig. S15 † ). Both complexes have slow ligand exchange processes on the NMR timescale ( Fig. 16 ). In Zn(tren3pyr) the signals of ethylene protons are considerably broadened and those of the benzylic protons completely disappeared from the spectra. On the other hand, at higher pH the signals are narrowed, and the benzylic protons (∼4.1 ppm) are clearly visible on the spectrum of Zn(tren3pyr)(OH), indicating conformationally less labile pyridine rings in this species (see later). The signals of aromatic protons are less affected by such dynamic processes, implying that zinc( II ) is coordinated only by the four nitrogens of the tren-like subunit, similarly to the corresponding copper( II ) complexes.

From Soup: 65 It is interesting to compare the p K s of coordinated water deprotonation in tren (p K = 9.17 (Cu), 10.4 (Zn)) and tren3pyr (p K = 8.41 (Cu), 9.34 (Zn)) complexes. Although, several reasons may lead to the higher water acidity in the present systems, 68 the conformationally less labile pyridine rings in Zn(tren3pyr)(OH) (see above) may indicate a H-bonding network between the hydroxide ion and pyridine nitrogen(s), which stabilize the position of the ring(s) and facilitate the formation of a M − OH − moiety.

From Soup: 66 The comparative evaluation of our solution chemical data indicated that the four polydentate tripodal ligands studied here exhibit a high thermodynamic stability, and a variety of coordination environments/geometries for manganese( II ), copper( II ) and zinc( II ). Tachpyr is a more efficient zinc( II ) chelator and a similar copper( II ) chelator compared to trenpyr. Considering the higher number of N-donors and conformational flexibility of trenpyr, as well as the energy demanding switch to the triaxial conformation required for metal ion binding of tachpyr, the above observation is surprising and is very likely due to the encapsulating effect of the more rigid tachpyr skeleton. This relative binding preference of tachpyr for zinc( II ) may be related to the observation that zinc( II ) is one of the principal metals targeted by tachpyr in cells. In contrast, trenpyr is a considerably more efficient manganese( II ) chelator, since it acts as a heptadentate ligand in the aqueous Mn(trenpyr) complex. The crystal structures of copper( II ) and zinc( II ) complexes of tachpyr indicated important differences in the ligand conformation, induced by the position of counter ions, as compared to earlier reports.

From Soup: 67 The closely related new ligands, tach3pyr and tren3pyr, have been designed to form oligonuclear complexes. Indeed, we obtained a three dimensional polymer with a copper( II )/tren3pyr ratio of 11/6. Within this metal–organic framework three distinctly different copper geometries can be identified. Two square pyramidal and four trigonal bipyramidal copper centres create a hexanuclear subunit with a large inside cavity. These moieties are linked by tetrahedral copper( II ) centres, forming the three-dimensional polymer structure.

From Soup: 68 In solution, only mononuclear complexes are formed with tach3pyr and tren3pyr, and the formation of polynuclear complexes was not detected. According to its facial donor set tach3pyr forms square pyramidal complexes. The copper( II ) core in Cu(tach3pyr)(OH) surrounded by aromatic rings does not facilitate the binding of a bnpp substrate, i.e. this complex has a comparable hydrolytic activity to copper( II ) complexes of other tach-derivatives. The absence of pyridine nitrogens in chelatable positions allows the tren-subunit to enforce trigonal bipyramidal geometry in tren3pyr complexes.
