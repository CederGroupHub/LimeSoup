From cou.: 1 Borazino-doped nanographenes belong to a special class of flat heteroaromatic networks comprising one or more fully formed borazino (B3N3) units in their framework. These systems carry the same number of electrons and feature similar structural forms as pristine nanographenes; however, they are characterized by different optoelectronic properties. As their full carbon analogues, borazino-doped graphene molecules could serve as excellent candidate molecules for flexible organic electronic and optical devices. In this study, we provided the results of a systematic study dealing with the effect of borazino units on the quadratic microscopic nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of finite graphene sections. These symmetry-dependent quantities describe the nonlinear polarization (hyperpolarization) of the electron cloud of molecules in the presence of external electric fields and they are associated with fundamental processes of extreme technological interest in the realm of nonlinear optics. More precisely, we investigated the evolution of the first dipole hyperpolarizability in several, purposely chosen, borazino-doped graphene flakes and ribbons, relying on long-range corrected density functional methods. Our results indicate that the presence of inorganic benzene in the honeycomb structure of graphene finite sections gives rise to some impressive structure–property variations driven by local electron delocalization effects. The take home message of this study suggests that borazino doping can deliver a vast assortment of nanographene molecules bearing amplified octupolar and/or dipolar NLO responses that can be fine-tuned by applying minor modifications in the structure and morphology of their edges.

From cou.: 2 The prospect of optimizing the optoelectronic properties of conjugated and polyaromatic hydrocarbon by replacing CC bonds with BN units has pushed forward the developments in the field of BN-doped carbon-based systems in the past few years.1–7 Among the various heteroaromatic networks comprising one or more BN units reported to date, borazino (B3N3)-doped molecules, in which the B3N3 units are fully incorporated in the framework of graphene-like materials, have started to attract significant attention. Recently, Krieg et al.8 reported the first prototype of hexa-perihexabenzoborazinocoronene, a borazinophore nanographene molecule (B3N3@HBC) in which a B3N3 unit is fully incorporated in the core of hexa-peri-benzocoronene (HBC). Sánchez-Sánchez et al.9 fabricated, from the bottom to up, networks of B3N3@HBC monomers through a surface-assisted polymerization and subsequent cyclodehydrogenation. Their study indicates that borazino-doped nanographene monomers can be used as precursors to design graphene-like materials of nonzero tunable bandgaps.10–14 Furthermore, in two recent articles, Bonifazi and co-workers announced15 a wide assortment of polyphenylene molecules bearing B3N3 units at preselected positions and also reported16 the rational synthesis of a soluble version of B3N3@HBC. This breakthrough allowed the study of its optoelectronic properties via UV/vis absorption, emission and electro-chemical techniques. The obtained results confirmed earlier theoretical predictions17–19 about the band gaps and the linear optical properties of such systems. It is believed that further growth in this field will provide new ideas in the realization of graphene-based systems with nonzero band gaps and will deliver the right precursors needed to synthesize borazino-doped nanographenes suitable for optoelectronic and photonic applications,20–24 such as in photodetectors,25 optical modulators26,27 and mode-locked ultrafast lasers.28

From cou.: 3 In the framework of the above developments, our group has studied a large collection of graphene-based systems doped with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BnNn)29 sections. We have shown by theoretical means that the combination of these two-dimensional (2D) materials should deliver systems of amplified molecular quadratic second order nonlinear optical (NLO) responses.30 We have also established17 that these properties greatly depend on local features of the valence electrons, such as the aromaticity of the graphene host. In this context, we have demonstrated that there are fundamental differences19 in the linear optical properties between finite and periodic B3N3-doped graphenes stemming from local electron delocalization effects, which are more pronounced in finite graphene-like molecules due to quantum confinement effects.

From cou.: 5 Just as the electric dipole polarizability37–39 (α) describes the distortion of the electron cloud of a molecule that arises as a linear response to a homogeneous external electric field, the first-order molecular dipole hyperpolarizability, referred to using the second letter of the Greek alphabet β, furnishes information about the nonlinear field-induced response of the electron cloud. In practice, the first hyperpolarizability is a third rank tensor that shows how easily the valence electrons move within a molecule under the influence of an external electric field. It is a symmetry-dependent property that vanishes in centrosymmetric systems and is associated with fundamental processes that lie in the realm of nonlinear optics,40 such as the electro-optic Pockels effect or the second harmonic generation (SHG). In terms of the sum-over-states perturbative approach41 (SOS), large molecular first hyperpolarizabilities imply strong intramolecular charge transfer excitations defined by sizable dipole moment differences between the ground and low-lying excited states and/or large transition dipoles between interacting excited states.31,42,43

From cou.: 22 Unless stated otherwise, all static and dynamic first hyperpolarizabilities have been computed analytically via the coupled perturbed Hartree–Fock54 (Kohn–Sham) approach as implemented in the GAUSSIAN 0955 suite of programs. In most of the cases, we applied the double-ζ 6-31G(d) basis set, while for some, small enough, systems we used richer sets comprising an increasing number of diffuse polarization functions. Geometry optimizations were performed at the B3LYP level using the 6-31G(d) or 6-31G basis sets depending on the size of the system. The equilibrium geometry of the reference B3N3@HBC was determined at the B3LYP/6-311G(2d) level. We relied on hybrid density functional methods of long-range corrected exchange functionals as implemented in GAUSSIAN 09, namely the long-range corrected version of B3LYP using the Coulomb-attenuating method (CAM-B3LYP),56 the long-range corrected functional developed by Hirao and co-workers, namely LC-BLYP,57 and the wB97X58 functional developed by Head-Gordon and co-workers. In the CAM-B3LYP version used in this work, the exchange interactions comprise at short (long) range: 19% (54%) Hartree–Fock and 81% (46%) DFT (Becke 88). The range separating parameter, (hereafter referred to as μ), which defines the portion of long-/short-range interactions comprised in the standard error function, was set as 0.33 Bohr−1. In the wB97X functional, the long-range exchange interactions are treated entirely by Hartree–Fock and the short-range exchange comprises: 15.7706% Hartree–Fock and 84.2294% DFT (B97). The range separating parameter in the latter functional was set as 0.30 Bohr−1. These are the default parameters used in GAUSSIAN 09 for both CAM-B3LYP and wB97X. In the case of the LC-BLYP, in which the long-/short-range exchange interactions are treated entirely by Hartree–Fock (DFT/BLYP), we considered two values of the range separating parameter: one of 0.33 Bohr−1 as in CAM-B3LYP and the default value in GAUSSIAN 09 of 0.47 Bohr−1.

From cou.: 23 For interpretation purposes, we employed the Fractional Occupation Hirsfeld-Iterative (FOHI) scheme (see ref. 59 and references therein) combined with an algorithm developed by Otero and co-workers.59 This computational scheme allows the use of standard visualization techniques to plot the so-called mean intrinsic polarizability (MIP) densities in the form of surface and/or mapped representations. As explained elsewhere,18,59 the term “intrinsic polarizability” refers to the pure polarizability of each atom of a molecule, free of charge transfer interactions. Herein, we use MIP densities to trace changes in electron delocalization caused by edge modifications in some of the systems studied. Additionally, we relied on electron two-center delocalization indices, which represent a measure of “how many” electrons are delocalized over two atoms with respect to a null Fermi-hole density. These quantities were derived from the expansion of the first-order density matrix of the system into higher order ones through the property of idempotence. All the indices were obtained through a Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) scheme implementation via the Generalized Population Analysis (GPA)60 approach. The calculations required were performed with a home-made FORTRAN code based on the QTAIM implementation of Mandado and co-workers.61,62 FOHI partitioning of the electron densities was carried out with the BRABO package63 and the STOCK program.64 More details about the implementation and some applications can be found in the ESI of ref. 30 and in ref. 19, 59 and 65.

From Soup: 52 Among the vast assortment of graphene finite sections that could be used as doping substrates, we chose a graphene flake of high symmetry ( D 6h ), as shown in Fig. 1 . C 234 H 42 (hereafter C 234 ) is a large planar polycyclic hydrocarbon (2.8 nm in diameter) characterized by a closed-shell singlet ground state. 18 Unlike other large armchair graphene sections, 67,68 C 234 keeps a quasi-planar shape in its equilibrium geometry due to the existence of four HC CH units bridging the two middle aromatic sextets in each of its six edges. In terms of Clar's aromaticity, 69,70 C 234 should be considered as a large polycyclic hydrocarbon featuring a unique Clar formula. 71,72 Molecules bearing such an aromaticity pattern can be synthesized with atomic precision 73–75 and they are characterized by extra stability and rather wide bandgaps, which depend on their size and edge structures.

From Soup: 53 Using C 234 as a host, we built a set of 11 isoelectronic-doped flake-models in which the labeled 0, ±1…±5 carbon aromatic rings were replaced by a single borazino unit (see Fig. 1 ). Labels of opposite signs refer to isomers in which symmetry equivalent sextets chains have been replaced by B 3 N 3 units of inverse orientation. Doping in sites (−5) and (5) is independent of the orientation of the borazino unit, thus, the corresponding doped isomers are identical. As verified by harmonic frequency computations and careful wavefunction stability tests, 18,76 all the doped systems maintain the planar shape and the singlet-closed-shell electronic structure of their parent pristine flake, respectively.

From Soup: 54 In Fig. 2 , we have plotted the evolution of the modulus ‖ β ‖ of doped C 234 as a function of the distance between the geometrical centers of each borazino unit and the center of the central carbon ring of C 234 . As can be seen, the confinement of a single B 3 N 3 ring in the framework of C 234 not only effectively switches on the second order NLO activity of C 234 , but also delivers nonlinear responses of important sizes 77 varying from 5 × 10 3 to 10 4 a.u. depending on the functional used. The principal structure–property relation describing these results suggests that the closer the borazino unit is placed to the center of the flake, the larger its first hyperpolarizability becomes.

From Soup: 55 A representative fraction of the above computations at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level complemented with HOMO–LUMO gaps (HLG), mean dipole polarizabilities, vertical optical gaps defined as the energetic difference between the ground states and the first allowed by the symmetry excited state, λ max values, nonlinear optical anisotropies ( ψ ) and dipolar/octupolar ( Φ J =1 / Φ J =3 ) hyperpolarizability contributions is summarized in Table 1 . Starting from the computed dipole moments ( μ tot ) and nonlinear optical anisotropies ( ψ ), it is revealed that, although borazino doping creates a rather weak permanent polarization of the electron density, it delivers largely anisotropic nonlinearities ( ψ > 1), suggesting that the confined borazino ring furnishes a strong octupolar character ( Φ J =1 ≪ Φ J =3 ) in the doped flakes.

From cou.: 56 In Fig. 2, we have plotted the evolution of the modulus ‖β‖ of doped C234 as a function of the distance between the geometrical centers of each borazino unit and the center of the central carbon ring of C234. As can be seen, the confinement of a single B3N3 ring in the framework of C234 not only effectively switches on the second order NLO activity of C234, but also delivers nonlinear responses of important sizes77 varying from 5 × 103 to 104 a.u. depending on the functional used. The principal structure–property relation describing these results suggests that the closer the borazino unit is placed to the center of the flake, the larger its first hyperpolarizability becomes.
From Soup: 56 The interplay between the octupolar and dipolar contributions in doped C 234 depends either on the position of the borazino ring with respect to the center of the flake and/or on its orientation. The maximum Φ J =3 is obtained for isomer (0)-B 3 N 3 @C 234 due to its purely octupolar symmetry ( D 3h ). As the borazino units move toward the edges of the flakes there is a strong weakening of the octupolar contributions in favor of the dipolar ones. Also, the relative variation of Φ J =3 in all the isomers bearing lower symmetries than D 3h appears to be affected by the orientation of the borazino ring. For instance, while in isomer (−3)-B 3 N 3 @C 234 Φ J =3 reduces to 0.78, in (3)-B 3 N 3 @C 234 the octupolar contributions are found to be as high as 0.92. The reverse behavior is observed when borazino is placed at the doping sites (±4).

From cou.: 57 A representative fraction of the above computations at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level complemented with HOMO–LUMO gaps (HLG), mean dipole polarizabilities, vertical optical gaps defined as the energetic difference between the ground states and the first allowed by the symmetry excited state, λmax values, nonlinear optical anisotropies (ψ) and dipolar/octupolar (ΦJ=1/ΦJ=3) hyperpolarizability contributions is summarized in Table 1. Starting from the computed dipole moments (μtot) and nonlinear optical anisotropies (ψ), it is revealed that, although borazino doping creates a rather weak permanent polarization of the electron density, it delivers largely anisotropic nonlinearities (ψ > 1), suggesting that the confined borazino ring furnishes a strong octupolar character (ΦJ=1 ≪ ΦJ=3) in the doped flakes.
From Soup: 57 Turning our attention to the computed HLGs and mean dipole polarizabilities ( ), a rather surprising effect is revealed. While trivially follows the evolution of the corresponding inverse HLGs, this is not the case for the first hyperpolarizabilities. The largest ‖ β ‖ corresponds to flake (0)-B 3 N 3 @C 234 featuring the wider HLG and the smallest dipole mean polarizability. Conversely, the isomers (±3)-B 3 N 3 @C 234 bear the smallest ‖ β ‖ and the narrowest HLGs. The absence of correlation between the HLGs and dipole hyperpolarizabilities also extends to other theoretically determined spectroscopic properties, such as the vertical optical gap and λ max . Through the prism of the SOS approach, such a trend suggests that matrix elements, as transition dipoles or dipole moment differences between the ground and charge transfer excited states, 30,77–79 should play a dominant role in the relative sizes of the second order NLO responses in these species.

From cou.: 58 The interplay between the octupolar and dipolar contributions in doped C234 depends either on the position of the borazino ring with respect to the center of the flake and/or on its orientation. The maximum ΦJ=3 is obtained for isomer (0)-B3N3@C234 due to its purely octupolar symmetry (D3h). As the borazino units move toward the edges of the flakes there is a strong weakening of the octupolar contributions in favor of the dipolar ones. Also, the relative variation of ΦJ=3 in all the isomers bearing lower symmetries than D3h appears to be affected by the orientation of the borazino ring. For instance, while in isomer (−3)-B3N3@C234ΦJ=3 reduces to 0.78, in (3)-B3N3@C234 the octupolar contributions are found to be as high as 0.92. The reverse behavior is observed when borazino is placed at the doping sites (±4).
From Soup: 58 To demonstrate that the sizes of the NLO responses of the doped flakes are not simply a product of the occurring symmetry breaking from D 6h to D 3h , C 2v and C s but that they are provoked by the presence of B 3 N 3 in their framework, we performed the computational experiment depicted in Fig. 3 . By removing purposely chosen aromatic rings from C 234 we created two pristine graphene hosts of C 2v symmetry bearing nonvanishing second order NLO responses in their pristine forms. We computed their first hyperpolarizabilities and then compared the obtained results with the analog borazino-doped systems. The values presented in Fig. 3 confirm that the incorporation of a single borazino unit in the framework of both graphene NLO active hosts triggers an impressive hyperpolarizability enhancement. Once more, the respective increase occurs despite the obvious band gap opening of 0.2 and 0.3 eV, respectively.
 ###### 
From cou.: 59 Turning our attention to the computed HLGs and mean dipole polarizabilities (), a rather surprising effect is revealed. While trivially follows the evolution of the corresponding inverse HLGs, this is not the case for the first hyperpolarizabilities. The largest ‖β‖ corresponds to flake (0)-B3N3@C234 featuring the wider HLG and the smallest dipole mean polarizability. Conversely, the isomers (±3)-B3N3@C234 bear the smallest ‖β‖ and the narrowest HLGs. The absence of correlation between the HLGs and dipole hyperpolarizabilities also extends to other theoretically determined spectroscopic properties, such as the vertical optical gap and λmax. Through the prism of the SOS approach, such a trend suggests that matrix elements, as transition dipoles or dipole moment differences between the ground and charge transfer excited states,30,77–79 should play a dominant role in the relative sizes of the second order NLO responses in these species.
From Soup: 59 In Fig. 4 , we provide some useful trends about the dependence of the computed molecular NLO responses on the functional used. In plot Fig. 4a , we can see that CAM-B3LYP yields a rather non-systematic variation in β zzz between (−2)-B 3 N 3 @C 234 and (2)-B 3 N 3 @C 234 . On the other hand, both the LC-BLYP and wB97X methods predict a smoother transition. Plot Fig. 4b illustrates the effect of the long-range correction on the relative magnitudes of β zzz between these isomers for different values of μ , which defines the short- and long-range portions of the two-electron operator. For the sake of comparison, the BLYP and B3LYP outcomes have been comprised in the same plot. It is obvious that the latter functionals predict a different variation of β zzz as a function of the doping site, which drastically changes when the long-range correction is activated. Bearing in mind that in the LC-BLYP functional the long-range part of the exchange interactions is treated entirely by Hartree–Fock, our results show that when the latter part becomes dominant ( μ → 1), the LC-BLYP hyperpolarizabilities increase in size and are expected to converge to the HF values from below. To check the validity of the observed method ordering, we performed MP2 first hyperpolarizability computations on a smaller borazino-doped molecular graphene, namely B 3 N 3 @HBC, 8 with various standard basis sets, and CCSD(T) calculations with the minimal basis set MINI 80 from Huzinaga after the atomic basis set of each heavy atom/hydrogen was polarized with one d/p-type Gaussian function that maximizes the mean dipole polarizability of B 3 N 3 @HBC. The relevant exponents were derived following the work of Maroulis. 81–83 Note that as in doped C 234 , in B 3 N 3 @HBC the B 3 N 3 unit replaces an aromatic sextet. Plot Fig. 4c reveals that either of the ab initio correlated methods, MP2 and CCSD(T), return smaller hyperpolarizabilities than HF, confirming to some extent the relative HF/LC-DFT ordering in the prediction of ‖ β ‖. More information about the performance of the DFT methods in the prediction of the dipole hyperpolarizabilities of the extended molecules can be found in ref. 84–90 .

From cou.: 60 To demonstrate that the sizes of the NLO responses of the doped flakes are not simply a product of the occurring symmetry breaking from D6h to D3h, C2v and Cs but that they are provoked by the presence of B3N3 in their framework, we performed the computational experiment depicted in Fig. 3. By removing purposely chosen aromatic rings from C234 we created two pristine graphene hosts of C2v symmetry bearing nonvanishing second order NLO responses in their pristine forms. We computed their first hyperpolarizabilities and then compared the obtained results with the analog borazino-doped systems. The values presented in Fig. 3 confirm that the incorporation of a single borazino unit in the framework of both graphene NLO active hosts triggers an impressive hyperpolarizability enhancement. Once more, the respective increase occurs despite the obvious band gap opening of 0.2 and 0.3 eV, respectively.
From Soup: 60 To obtain a semi quantitative picture about the performance of the long-range corrected funtionals in the case of the latter reference molecule, we computed its modulus ‖ β ‖ at the CAM-B3LYP/MINI* level and we compared the respective outcomes with those obtained at the MP2 and CCSD(T) levels of theory. The computed CPKS CAM-B3LYP/MINI* ‖ β ‖ value of 686.8 a.u. was found to be lower than the corresponding finite field [HF, CCSD(T)]/MINI* values of 738.7 and 715.1 a.u., respectively. On the other hand, CAM-B3LYP/MINI* ‖ β ‖ reproduces the MP2/MINI* value of 686.5 a.u. Hence, for this reference borazino-doped molecular graphene, the MINI* basis set delivers the subsequent magnitude ordering: HF > CCSD(T) > MP2 ≅ CAM-B3LYP, which is consistent with the MP2 results obtained with the richer basis sets. Nonetheless, it should be emphasized that the latter results could serve only for qualitative purposes. This is because quantitatively accurate CCSD(T) results can be obtained only if one applies a considerably richer basis set than the minimal MINI*, which was chosen in this study to minimize the computational cost of the CCSD(T) computations.
 ###### 
From cou.: 61 In Fig. 4, we provide some useful trends about the dependence of the computed molecular NLO responses on the functional used. In plot Fig. 4a, we can see that CAM-B3LYP yields a rather non-systematic variation in βzzz between (−2)-B3N3@C234 and (2)-B3N3@C234. On the other hand, both the LC-BLYP and wB97X methods predict a smoother transition. Plot Fig. 4b illustrates the effect of the long-range correction on the relative magnitudes of βzzz between these isomers for different values of μ, which defines the short- and long-range portions of the two-electron operator. For the sake of comparison, the BLYP and B3LYP outcomes have been comprised in the same plot. It is obvious that the latter functionals predict a different variation of βzzz as a function of the doping site, which drastically changes when the long-range correction is activated. Bearing in mind that in the LC-BLYP functional the long-range part of the exchange interactions is treated entirely by Hartree–Fock, our results show that when the latter part becomes dominant (μ → 1), the LC-BLYP hyperpolarizabilities increase in size and are expected to converge to the HF values from below. To check the validity of the observed method ordering, we performed MP2 first hyperpolarizability computations on a smaller borazino-doped molecular graphene, namely B3N3@HBC,8 with various standard basis sets, and CCSD(T) calculations with the minimal basis set MINI80 from Huzinaga after the atomic basis set of each heavy atom/hydrogen was polarized with one d/p-type Gaussian function that maximizes the mean dipole polarizability of B3N3@HBC. The relevant exponents were derived following the work of Maroulis.81–83 Note that as in doped C234, in B3N3@HBC the B3N3 unit replaces an aromatic sextet. Plot Fig. 4c reveals that either of the ab initio correlated methods, MP2 and CCSD(T), return smaller hyperpolarizabilities than HF, confirming to some extent the relative HF/LC-DFT ordering in the prediction of ‖β‖. More information about the performance of the DFT methods in the prediction of the dipole hyperpolarizabilities of the extended molecules can be found in ref. 84–90.
From Soup: 61 Concerning the basis set effect on the properties of interest, the results shown in plot Fig. 4c clearly demonstrate a strong dependence of the first hyperpolarizability of B 3 N 3 -doped HBC at the HF level. As probably expected, the smallest ‖ β ‖ at the HF level was obtained with the MINI* basis set, while the larger hyperpolarizability value was obtained with 6-311+G(d), which comprises a set of diffuse sp gaussian type basis functions in each heavy atom. It has been well established that such a diffuse function plays an very important role in the (hyper)polarizabilities of small molecules. 81–83 Nevertheless, diffuse basis sets are nor practical in the case of extended molecules because they yield problems in the self-consistent field (SCF) convergence procedure due to the linear basis set dependencies. The size ordering of ‖ β ‖ with respect to the basis set choice obtained at the HF level was maintained at the MP2 level in the case of the three largest basis set considered for this reference molecule. Interestingly, the triple- ζ 6-311G(2d,2p) basis set returned the smallest ‖ β ‖ at the MP2 level of theory out of the four basis sets considered here. This result clearly suggests that more work is needed in terms of the basis set to make conclusions on the quantitatively accurate values of the nonlinear optical properties of such systems, a task that is beyond the scope of this work.

From Soup: 62 A complete investigation of the role of the host in the second NLO of the borazino-doped graphenes is not an easy task due to the numerous choices of graphene sections to be considered. Hence, to keep track of the effects to be met in our investigation in a systematic and controllable manner, we chose systems that one way or another are related to C 234 . More specifically, we started our investigation from the linear chains shown in Fig. 5 . These p -phenylene oligomers (hereafter referred to as OPP chains) match the central chain of C 234 . Our choice was based on the aromaticity pattern of C 234 , which suggests that graphene sections of such aromatic patterns can be viewed as networks of OPP chains joined by single bonds that hold all the benzene rings on the same plane. The second set of models comprised two families of short B 3 N 3 -doped ribbons of the same length but different edge structures. These systems can be viewed as fragments of flakes (±2, ±1, 0)-B 3 N 3 @C 234 and were built upon the set of planar linear chains we described, as shown in Fig. 6 . From another point of view, the basic difference between ribbons belonging to groups K and Π lies in the HC CH units bridging the armchair aromatic edges of the latter. As will be revealed, this seemingly minor structural difference is very crucial for the NLO responses of these species.

From Soup: 64 We performed hyperpolarizability computations in both planar and fully relaxed twisted nuclear geometries to address the impact of planarity on the magnitudes of the NLO responses of the doped OPP-chains. The results of these calculations, depicted in Fig. 7 , expose that the largest NLO responses are delivered when B 3 N 3 replaces the middle benzene ring. As we go from isomer 0 to isomers ±1, ±2 and ±3, the longitudinal hyperpolarizability component follows a decreasing pattern and reaches its minimum value at positions ±3. This trend is common for both planar and twisted linear chains and is supported by computations performed at the HF, MP2 and LC-DFT levels using basis sets of increasing size and different constructions, namely, 6-31G(d), 6-31G(2d) and cc-pVDZ.

From Soup: 65 The paramount importance of the inclusion of long-range corrections in the DFT functionals used for CPKS hyperpolarizability was once more verified by the results in Fig. 7 . It is obvious that conventional functionals, such as B3LYP, fail to reproduce the evolution of β zzz predicted by the other ab initio and DFT methods we applied. The poorest performance was observed in the case of the planar chains, which were also the most (hyper)polarizable ones and those bearing the smaller band gaps. Interestingly, B3LYP diverged considerably from the other methods for doping sites for ±3 and ±2 doping sites. On the other hand, for sites ±1, the latter functional seemed to reproduce the MP2 and CAM-B3LYP results. Finally, when the borazino ring replaced the central phenyl ring of the planar chains, B3LYP underestimated the first hyperpolarizability with respect to both the MP2 and CAM-B3LYP methods. For the twisted chains, B3LYP seemed to improve up to some point its performance in describing the type of β zzz evolution, though, overshooting the respective property.

From cou.: 66 We performed hyperpolarizability computations in both planar and fully relaxed twisted nuclear geometries to address the impact of planarity on the magnitudes of the NLO responses of the doped OPP-chains.

From Soup: 66 The impact of planarity on the second order NLO responses is very well depicted in the results listed in Table 2 . As seen, going from the twisted C 1 structures to the planar C 2v ones, the β zzz component significantly increases. Accordingly, the modulus ‖ β ‖ escalates by a factor of 2 to 3. The observed property enhancement could be attributed to two cooperative effects. The most influential should involve the drastic HLG decrease going from C 1 chains to C 2v , since the transition from linear twisted chains - C 1 to planar ones are followed by a HLG decrease ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 eV. The second should implicate the polarity of the planar structures, which as suggested by their scalar dipole moment values, are always stronger than in the twisted chains. The larger charge separation is expected to trigger an increase in the dipole moment differences between the ground and the charge transfer states involved in their polarization mechanism. 42 See, for instance, the results corresponding to chains (2)- C 2v and (3)- C 2v . The first, which is the most polarized out of the two, is the most hyperpolarizable one despite its wider HLG.

From Soup: 67 In Fig. 8 , we compare the hyperpolarizability evolution between the two linear OPP-chains and doped C 234 . Plot Fig. 8a reveals that doped chains share the same variation pattern in ‖ β ‖ with doped C 234 . The main difference is spotted in the sizes of the obtained NLO responses. C 234 -doped flakes are found always to be more hyperpolarizable than both types of linear chains. The observed differences in ‖ β ‖ stem from the off-diagonal Cartesian hyperpolarizability components, β yyz , which are at least one order of magnitude larger in the doped flakes than in the linear chains. On the other hand, the diagonal β zzz components, which describe the hyperpolarization along the C 2 symmetry axis, were found to be comparable to those of the linear planar OPP chains.

From cou.: 68 The impact of planarity on the second order NLO responses is very well depicted in the results listed in Table 2. As seen, going from the twisted C1 structures to the planar C2v ones, the βzzz component significantly increases. Accordingly, the modulus ‖β‖ escalates by a factor of 2 to 3.

The larger charge separation is expected to trigger an increase in the dipole moment differences between the ground and the charge transfer states involved in their polarization mechanism.42 See, for instance, the results corresponding to chains (2)-C2v and (3)-C2v. The first, which is the most polarized out of the two, is the most hyperpolarizable one despite its wider HLG.
From Soup: 68 The change in the character of the NLO responses as one goes form the doped flakes to the linear OPP chains is expressed by the calculated quantities Φ J =1 and Φ J =3 listed in Table 2 . As pointed out, there is a drastic reduction in the octupolar contributions in favor of the dipolar ones due to the weakening of the off-diagonal hyperpolarizability components. Nevertheless, both families of linear chains maintain a non-negligible octupolar character. As has been shown by Brasselet and Zyss, 50 in rod-like systems of C 2v the symmetry, ψ 2 is a steeply ascending function of the ratio . This dependence is responsible for the rather strong octupolar contributions in these linear molecules despite their weak off-diagonal β ijj hyperpolarizability components.

From Soup: 70 Up to this point we have seen that the behavior of the first hyperpolarizability in C 234 , with respect to the position of the aromatic doping site, matches the hyperpolarizability evolution observed in isolated planar and/or twisted borazine-doped linear phenyl chains. Now, we want to explore how these properties evolve as one goes from the linear chains to doped C 234 via the two ribbon families we considered (see Fig. 6 ).

From Soup: 71 The variations of ‖ β ‖ in ribbons belonging to the Π and K families, computed at the CAM/B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory, are illustrated in Fig. 9 . At first glance, it is revealed that while the systems in group K deliver hyperpolarizability variations like those observed in both doped OPP-chains and C 234 , the members of group Π follow precisely the inverse trend. In either case, the observed differences are caused by the longitudinal hyperpolarizability components of these species. In addition, impressively strong hyperpolarizability fluctuations are observed between the members of group K, as B 3 N 3 migrates from one aromatic sextet to the next. Thus, the hyperpolarizabilities obtained for those isomers in which the B 3 N 3 unit is placed in positions (±1,0) were found to be 3 to 4 times more sizable than in the rest of systems. On the other hand, in all the other studied cases the dependence of the hyperpolarizability magnitudes was much less pronounced.

From cou.: 72 Up to this point we have seen that the behavior of the first hyperpolarizability in C234, with respect to the position of the aromatic doping site, matches the hyperpolarizability evolution observed in isolated planar and/or twisted borazine-doped linear phenyl chains. Now, we want to explore how these properties evolve as one goes from the linear chains to doped C234via the two ribbon families we considered (see Fig. 6).
From Soup: 72 To understand the source of the above contradicting trends observed in finite ribbons, we employed first an SOS approach within the framework of time-dependent density functional theory. Our aim was to identify the dominant charge transfer exited states that contribute the most to the second order nonlinear optical responses of these hybrid ribbons. Unfortunately, the SOS series did not converge even when 200 excited states were considered. Therefore, we could not retrieve safe information about the underlying charge transfer mechanism as in the other cases. 30,78 For this reason, we examined the spatial distribution of Δ ρ F i and ρ (2) ii as defined in a previous section. The obtained results are presented in Fig. 10 in the form of projected contour maps. In all cases, the electric fields were applied along the elongated direction of the ribbons. One should bear in mind that the lengths of the three ribbons along the axis of the applied field are practically the same, allowing us to qualitatively compare directly the obtained density maps.

In either case, the observed differences are caused by the longitudinal hyperpolarizability components of these species.

On the other hand, in all the other studied cases the dependence of the hyperpolarizability magnitudes was much less pronounced.
From Soup: 73 Starting from plot Fig. 10a , which represents the movement of charge from the left side of the ribbons to the right, we see that the spatial distributions and the sign of Δ ρ F i ( ) show many similarities in both doped ribbons. Both the positive/negative Δ ρ F i ( ) areas, which point out the part of the ribbons in which the electron density increases/decreases after the application of the field, exhibit similar shapes and distributions. This suggests that the electron cloud in ribbons Π 1 “polarizes” in a similar manner as in ribbons K 1 in the presence of the same external dipole field. However, when one compares the spatial distributions of the second derivative of the electron density, ρ (2) ii , along the long direction ( z axis) of both ribbons, obvious and dramatic differences are exposed. Furthermore, when these densities are compared to those of the pristine ribbons, it is revealed that the dramatic deviations in ρ (2) ii are not a product of the borazino doping as might have been expected, but rather they have been inherited from the pristine ribbons Π 1 and K 1 .

Our aim was to identify the dominant charge transfer exited states that contribute the most to the second order nonlinear optical responses of these hybrid ribbons. Unfortunately, the SOS series did not converge even when 200 excited states were considered.

One should bear in mind that the lengths of the three ribbons along the axis of the applied field are practically the same, allowing us to qualitatively compare directly the obtained density maps.
From Soup: 74 Taking into account that ribbon K 1 can be obtained by “bridging” the external aromatic rings of Π 1 with HCCH units, it would be natural to speculate that the contradicting hyperpolarizability trends could be connected to this structural feature. This deduction fits to the findings of an earlier study reported by Martín-Martínez et al. 91 These authors showed that graphene ribbons bearing the structural characteristics of Π 1 and K 1 could be classified with respect to their aromaticity as systems of complete and incomplete Clar aromaticity, respectively. The first class of ribbons shows a metal-like behavior due to their small band gaps. On the other hand, ribbons bearing a complete Clar aromaticity pattern feature semiconductor-like band gaps. Nevertheless, this classification was only tested in one dimensional (1D) periodic ribbons and not in finite, zero dimensional (0D), ribbons of short lengths. Thus, to trace the differences in cyclic electron delocalization between these systems, we computed and compared the +MIP densities of the pristine Π 1 and K 1 ribbons ( Fig. 11 ).
 ###### 
From cou.: 75 Starting from plot Fig. 10a, which represents the movement of charge from the left side of the ribbons to the right, we see that the spatial distributions and the sign of ΔρFi() show many similarities in both doped ribbons. Both the positive/negative ΔρFi() areas, which point out the part of the ribbons in which the electron density increases/decreases after the application of the field, exhibit similar shapes and distributions. This suggests that the electron cloud in ribbons Π1 “polarizes” in a similar manner as in ribbons K1 in the presence of the same external dipole field. However, when one compares the spatial distributions of the second derivative of the electron density, ρ(2)ii, along the long direction (z axis) of both ribbons, obvious and dramatic differences are exposed. Furthermore, when these densities are compared to those of the pristine ribbons, it is revealed that the dramatic deviations in ρ(2)ii are not a product of the borazino doping as might have been expected, but rather they have been inherited from the pristine ribbons Π1 and K1.
From Soup: 75 As discussed in previous studies, 17–19 the aromatic sextets in graphene-type molecules feature continuous ring-like positive MIP (+MIP) densities. On the other hand, +MIP densities of “broken” or “star-like” topologies correspond to nonaromatic carbon rings. In line with these visual qualitative criteria, the obtained +MIP contour maps of Fig. 11 point out that in their interior, both pristine ribbons Π 1 and K 1 should bear similar aromaticity patterns. However, a closer look at the shapes of the respective densities reveals some important qualitative differences. First, in ribbon Π 1 (complete Clar), the aromatic benzene rings feature +MIP densities of ellipsoid shapes, in which the major axes are found to be parallel to the D 2 symmetry axis of the molecule. In contrast, the major axes of the elliptical +MIP densities of the aromatic sextets in K 1 (incomplete Clar) adopt a perpendicular orientation with respect to the same axis of symmetry. Second, there are significant differences between the spatial distribution of the +MIP densities around the CC bonds connecting the various aromatic sextets. Computations of two-center delocalization indices in these bonds expose that these differences in the +MIP densities are related to an increase in the delocalization of these CC bonds as one goes from ribbon Π 1 (complete Clar) to K 1 (incomplete Clar). Bearing in mind that the delocalization of the electrons over two atoms provides a measure of the respective bond order, our results suggest that the phenylene network in the first family (Π 1 ) should be less “conjugated” than in the second (K 1 ).

From cou.: 76 Taking into account that ribbon K1 can be obtained by “bridging” the external aromatic rings of Π1 with HCCH units, it would be natural to speculate that the contradicting hyperpolarizability trends could be connected to this structural feature. This deduction fits to the findings of an earlier study reported by Martín-Martínez et al.91 These authors showed that graphene ribbons bearing the structural characteristics of Π1 and K1 could be classified with respect to their aromaticity as systems of complete and incomplete Clar aromaticity, respectively. The first class of ribbons shows a metal-like behavior due to their small band gaps. On the other hand, ribbons bearing a complete Clar aromaticity pattern feature semiconductor-like band gaps. Nevertheless, this classification was only tested in one dimensional (1D) periodic ribbons and not in finite, zero dimensional (0D), ribbons of short lengths. Thus, to trace the differences in cyclic electron delocalization between these systems, we computed and compared the +MIP densities of the pristine Π1 and K1 ribbons (Fig. 11).
From Soup: 76 The above results point out that the contradicting hyperpolarizability variations observed in doped ribbons Π and K should originate from the different delocalization in their polyphenylene network, which in turn, appears to depend on the morphology and the structure of their edges. 91,92 The latter deduction is fully confirmed by the results presented in Fig. 12 . There, we see that the variation patterns in the doped ribbons Π 1 transform in a systematic manner to those observed in ribbons K 1 as a function of the number of HCCH units bringing the external benzene rings of Π 1 . The influence of the bridging units is so decisive that major changes in the second order NLO responses of these ribbons are provoked even by connecting only two out of the six external carbon rings of Π 1 on each side. Furthermore, in Fig. 13 , it is seen that these trends are robust enough to hold even in the case of dynamic hyperpolarizabilities. Hence, either in terms of the Pockels electro-optic effect ( β (− ω , ω , 0), ω = 1024 nm) or in second harmonic generation ( β (−2 ω , ω , ω ), ω = 1024 nm), ‖ β ‖ variations and magnitudes are dominated by the nature of the graphene host in the same manner as in the static case.

From Soup: 77 The strong structure–property relation that emerged in the short graphene ribbons we examined above also applies as a rule of thumb in other graphene finite sections bearing similar aromaticity patterns. In Fig. 14 , we functionalized several borazino-doped graphene flakes by bridging some (or all) of the terminating aromatic sextets with HC CH units. We computed their first hyperpolarizabilities and then compared them with those of their parent structures. In all the studied cases, a substantial increase in the second hyperpolarizability was observed. See for instance the hyperpolarizabilities corresponding to flakes labeled as C 122 and C 138 . Either system was built upon a smaller armchair flake of 114 carbon atoms by adding 4 or 12 HCCH bridging units in their edges, respectively. In both cases, the hyperpolarizability ‖ β ‖ increased by 5 and 19 times, respectively, with respect to the original borazino-doped flake.

From Soup: 78 In previous reports, 17,19 we demonstrated that the substitution of an aromatic carbon ring of a given graphene flake with B 3 N 3 yields less polarizable systems. In every other case, the polarizability of the doped systems increases as compared to the pristine parent system. Hence, it would be meaningful to investigate the impact of this effect on the first hyperpolarizability. For this reason, we considered the four doped flakes shown in Fig. 15 . In flakes A and B, six borazino units replace rings of high cyclic electron delocalization (aromatic sextets). On the other hand, in A′ and B′, each B 3 N 3 unit replaces a “nonaromatic” carbon hexagon. The relative orientation and the positions of the embedded borazino rings in the first group were purposely chosen to reduce the symmetry of the parent pristine flake from D 6h to D 3h .

From Soup: 79 The static and dynamic (hyper)polarizabilities, computed at a laser frequency of 1064 nm, of these models and the corresponding HLGs vertical optical gaps and λ max values are summarized in Table 3 . Out of the four isoelectronic systems, flakes A′ and B′ are by far the most hyperpolarizable ones. When going from flakes A and B to A′ and B′, a decrease of about 1–1.2 eV in the HLG brings a two-fold increase in the static first hyperpolarizability. A similar effect was observed in the vertical optical gaps (VOGs) or the λ max values. These data suggest that the observed sharp hyperpolarizability increase should be mostly attributed to the evident decrease of the energetic differences between the ground and excited states of these systems. The trend obtained for the static dipole hyperpolarizabilities was reproduced for the SHG dynamic hyperpolarizabilities computed at a frequency of 1064 nm (∼1.2 eV). In this case though, the hyperpolarizabilities of A′ and B′ lie one order of magnitude higher than in the A and B isomers.

From Soup: 80 In this work, we explored the behavior of the first hyperpolarizability in a series of borazino-doped graphenes. Our results suggest that the incorporation of a single borazino ring in the framework of a given pristine graphene flake induces drastic changes on the second order nonlinear optical behavior of the host, delivering, under certain conditions, extremely amplified NLO responses even in systems of wide band gaps. Also, it was established that large NLO responses of octupolar contributions can be achieved by incorporating B 3 N 3 unit(s) in certain finite sections of graphene. The characters of the NLO properties are determined by the position of the borazino unit in the framework of the graphene host. The exposed systematic trends point out that the size and the evolution of the microscopic nonlinear optical responses of these systems greatly depend on the cyclic electron delocalization and could be tuned by targeted edge modifications. In a forthcoming article, we shall demonstrate and discuss the impact of multi borazino doping on the NLO properties of finite and periodic graphene sections, emphasizing the synergetic effects arising from the co-existence of more than one borazino unit in the framework of finite and periodic graphene architectures.
