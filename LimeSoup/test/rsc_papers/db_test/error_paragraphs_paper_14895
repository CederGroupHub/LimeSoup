From cou.: 1 The inference of responsive metabolic pathways from transcriptomic data remains a problem which needs to be solved. In this work, we make use of time-series transcriptomic data and the inherent structure of a metabolic network to examine the possibility of metabolic pathway inference. We present a method that calculates the state of each network metabolite for the different time points of a transcriptomic dataset. This forms the basis for metabolic pathway enrichment analysis based on time-series gene expression data. Application of the method to yeast transcriptomic datasets revealed metabolic pathways that showed the highest respective response during nitrogen starvation, amino acid starvation and under the influence of heat. Furthermore, key metabolic pathways related to the yeast cell cycle, like the lipid metabolism in the G1 phase, were identified. Therefore, a method for systematic determination of metabolic pathways that showed the highest change under given conditions was introduced. The proposed method allows for the analysis of transcriptomic data closely related to the metabolism of the cell by using the structure of the metabolic network as a framework for analysis, especially by using time-series transcriptomic data.

From cou.: 2 Transcriptomic data analysis is a widely applied method in many genomic and systems biology studies nowadays. The expression levels of almost every gene in a specific organism can be monitored. In particular, functional relationships are inferred by detecting correlations in the time course of the expression of different genes. Correlations can be determined using, e.g., clustering techniques or dynamic programming approaches.1–3 Metabolic networks are also analyzed frequently in order to gain a deeper insight into the cell metabolism. Different methods can therefore be applied to the network, for example, network decomposition or characterization of its topology.4,5 It has been shown that the inclusion of already existing knowledge into the transcriptomic data analysis yields more reliable results on the metabolism of the cell.6–8 Other approaches combine data from metabolite and gene expression measurements. Different studies indicate that these two different levels could be directly related to each other under certain conditions,9–13 however the coverage of metabolite measurements is still lower than the measurement of gene expression. Because of this, there is a need for methods for transcriptomic data analysis which give insights into the metabolism of the cell. Patil and Nielsen14 combined transcriptomic data with the topology of a metabolic network to infer regulations directly on the level of the metabolites without measuring them and also showed its successful application.15–18 Schwartz et al.19 applied elementary node analysis on transcriptomic datasets to determine the influence of stress on metabolic pathways. However, the methodology for inferring responsive metabolic pathways from transcriptomic data still has to be extended in order to account for the complexity of interactions in the cell's metabolic network. In particular, methods are needed to exploit the rich dynamic information of transcriptomic data in time-resolved experiments.

From cou.: 3 In this study, a method is proposed that explores the structural information of a metabolic network in the analysis of time-series transcriptomic data. The method takes advantage of the connectivity of the network metabolites to each other via their reactions in the network. It considers the influence on network metabolites by their direct and indirect neighboring reactions for the different time points of gene expression datasets to infer responsive metabolic pathways. This methodology does not aim at the prediction of novel pathways but at the prediction of highly affected pathways.

From cou.: 4 The algorithm generates a specific value for each network metabolite in a metabolic network for every time point of a time-series transcriptomic dataset, named Characteristic Metabolite Value (CMV). By comparing the extent of changes of CMV in every metabolic pathway, the method tries to identify potential hot-spots of affection in the metabolism at given experimental conditions. The proposed method does not try to predict real biological metabolite concentrations based on gene expression measurements, but instead tries to identify global responsive metabolic pathways. The gene expression data are directly related to the rate that the corresponding reaction occurs. This approach clearly neglects the manifold regulatory processes like mRNA degradation, translational efficiency, post translational modifications and so on. Nevertheless, instead of simply drawing conclusions on pathway regulations solely based on gene expression changes, this method evaluates whether gene expression changes would be of relevance in case of their representation in enzyme activity on the basis of the given connectivity of a metabolic network. For this purpose, the transcripts are assigned to their corresponding reactions in the metabolic network and subsequently the state of all network metabolites is calculated iteratively. Therefore, the calculated metabolite concentrations are plotted against the iterations for one time point and the integration of the area below the curve describes the state of the network metabolite, the CMV. Consequently, by integrating the network metabolite area, one CMV is obtained for every network metabolite for every experimental time point.

From cou.: 5 The state of a metabolite in the network is affected by the transcript levels of its surrounding reactions. Fig. 1 highlights the basic work flow when integrating a priori knowledge in the analysis of gene expression in a simplified example of a linear pathway. The network metabolite m1 is converted via three reactions r1–r3 into metabolite m4. The development of network metabolites m1 and m4 over the iterations is depicted in Fig. 2. Since the hypothetical pathway exhibits only irreversible reactions, the curve for m1 continuously decreases and for m4 increases. If gene expression measurements reveal a decrease of transcript t1, but no change of t2 and t3, the analysis of gene expression alone would result in no statistical significance that this metabolic pathway is affected by the experimental conditions, since only one transcript out of three is changed. When calculating the flow through all reactions and thus the speed that the metabolites are being converted (the area then gives CMV), one would observe that all four metabolites are affected by the decrease of a single transcript in this pathway, resulting in a significantly high number of affected network metabolites. Manual study of the gene expression would also lead to this conclusion, but bio-computational methods like clustering with subsequent GO enrichment would miss this. This can be seen in the progression of m1r1 and m4r1 in Fig. 2, which depicts the progression of m1 and m4 when the transcript level t1 is decreased. The conversion of the network metabolites, represented by CMV, is not interpreted in terms of its tendency to decrease or increase, but the state of the metabolites is analyzed by comparing the time points to each other. Afterwards, the network metabolites are assigned to their corresponding pathways and the pathways are then analyzed.

From cou.: 6 Fig. 3 shows a schematic explanation of the analysis compared to clustering. The network metabolite data, analog to the gene expression data, can be clustered and selected cluster subsequently enriched into pathways. Instead of clustering, one CMV for every network metabolite for each time point of the experiment is calculated. The highest ranking ΔCMVs are analyzed using pathway enrichment, or all values of CMV* are used to calculate a pathway score CPV. CPV calculation yields an overall score for every KEGG metabolic pathway that allows the visual inspection of the time-dependent changes, e.g., in the yeast cell cycle. If the clustering results in significantly enriched pathways, the CPV calculation leads also to clear patterns over time, where the standard deviation depicts the variation of the single network metabolites following these patterns. A metabolic pathway is enriched with high significance after clustering if many metabolites of this pathway are grouped together in the same cluster and thus, the metabolites that belong to this pathway exhibit similar expression over time. The same holds true for CPV calculation, where a clear pattern over time with low standard deviation is created for a metabolic pathway if many network metabolites of this pathway show similar expression.

From cou.: 7 The algorithm calculates new levels for all network metabolites using all network reactions as a model for the cell's metabolism in order to reveal potentially affected metabolic pathways but not to predict real metabolite concentrations in the cell. This calculation is carried out iteratively and thus for every metabolite one obtains the concentrations of all network metabolites for every iteration. This approach is based on the assumption that overall reaction throughput at a specific network node is primarily determined by enzyme expression and hence gene expression. This neglects regulation activities like post-translational modification or feedback inhibition, since this information cannot be derived from the available transcriptional data. The difference ΔMi that a network metabolite Mi is changed at an iteration, is given by the sum of additions plus the sum of subtractions: The addition of this network metabolite is defined by all network reactions Rj where the metabolite takes part as product and the subtractions where it can act as reactant. The normalized transcript levels here represent the reaction rate k in eqn (2). Therefore, the log2 ratios to sample point t0 of the original datasets were converted into values between 0.1 and 1. This normalization was not performed individually for every gene but by consideration of all transcripts. This calculation simply transforms all data points linearly into values 0.1 ≤ k ≤ 1 and consequently, the highest transcript level is assigned the normalized reaction rate 1. The lowest possible value after normalization was k = 0.1 in order to always ensure a minimum flow through every reaction. The assignment of the transcripts to the reactions in the network was done via their E.C. numbers (Enzyme Commission numbers). The E.C. numbers were assigned to the systematic names using the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) (http:\\www.yeastgenome.org). The metabolic network was obtained from the extended bioreaction database from Stelzer et al.20 For application of the method, all reactions that are regarded yeast specific by KEGG (sce), were considered in the network.

From Soup: 24 Taking all reactions into account, the resulting concentrations for each network metabolite M i at the end of the current iteration are generated. The higher the transcript level k at the given experimental time point, the higher the flow through this reaction. The same holds true for high network metabolite levels. The resulting curves of all network metabolites M i over the number of iterations are affected mainly by the assigned transcript levels of the associated reactions. Because the reactions are connected to each other in the metabolic network, the transcript levels of the surrounding reactions also influence this metabolite. The speed of decrease or increase of M i reflects the influence of the current gene expression state on this network metabolite. The iterative calculations are carried out until the steady state for all metabolites is reached ( e.g. , <0.01% change), which depends on the metabolic network, the gene expression data, the constant K and the starting value for all network metabolites. In this work, 50 000 iterations are computed ensuring changes smaller than 0.005%. From M i over every iteration the integral is calculated in order to derive only one value for each metabolite. This value is named Characteristic Metabolite Value (CMV). The integral of the resulting curve is calculated using the Simpson's rule, taking the interval [ i , i +2]. By application of the method on a time series dataset, a value for CMV for every time point of the experiment is obtained. This CMV time course can then be further analyzed.

From Soup: 25 The integration of M i over the iterations results in the value CMV t for every time point t of the transcriptomic dataset. Since the areas below the M i curves are highly different in their magnitude depending on the tendency of a network metabolite to decrease or increase, the CMVs are normalized based on their magnitude. Therefore, the CMV norm for the network with all reaction rates k set to 1 is calculated. The normalized value CMV * t for every time point t is then calculated by In case of, e.g. , stress experiments, the overall sum of changes ΔCMV as response to the stress is desired: Thus, the gene expression data are reduced to only one value ΔCMV for every network metabolite. The 15% (271) top scoring network metabolites were subsequently used for a pathway enrichment.

From Soup: 32 The pathway enrichment is carried out in analogy to the widely used GO enrichment. The pathway list was obtained from KEGG. 21 The enrichment is based on the cumulative hypergeometric distribution: It calculates the sum of the probabilities of the occurrence of K − 1 and less metabolites of one specific pathway, consisting of M metabolites, with respect to the number n of significant identified metabolites. The p -value is then one minus this probability. N is the total number of all metabolites in the network.

From Soup: 39 For evaluation of the performance of the proposed method, the algorithm was applied on the artificial network shown in Fig. 4 . This analysis demonstrates that the method is able to reveal the influence on the network metabolites by changes of the reaction rates, given by transcript level changes. This is, the calculated CMV* itself is presented by the bar plot without further processing of these values, like with ΔCMV and CPV calculations. For this, the reaction rates were changed individually for every reaction of the network. The application of the method on the simplified artificial network also demonstrates that metabolites are being affected within a given metabolic network by reactions that are not direct neighboring reactions. It should be noted that the plot is normalized in a log-scale in order to better visualize small changes. Fig. 4 shows the expected response of the network metabolites on changes in the transcript level of single reactions. The metabolites directly associated with the reaction where the change occurs are affected most: Metabolites A and B in reaction 1, B and C in reaction 2 and so on. The metabolites of the reactions in the center of the network (reactions 2, 5 and 6) show the highest changes. The higher the distance of a reaction from the network center, the lower is the absolute network metabolite change. Consequently, the metabolites show their lowest response when reaction 4 is changed. It becomes clear that the network metabolites are also influenced by their position within the network, in addition to the change of reaction rate itself. If one reaction in the network is irreversible, as can be seen in the lower picture, the influence of a single reaction change on the metabolites is shifted. The relative metabolite change depends on the distance from the irreversible reaction. The metabolites downstream of the irreversible reaction always show very low changes, except when the transcript change occurs in their associated reaction (reaction 4). This can be explained by the continuous transfer of network metabolites from the upstream part of the network into the downstream part via the irreversible reaction, whereas no back flow is possible.

The use of ΔCMV offers a systematic and simple identification of relevant metabolites for a given condition, but it neglects oscillating time courses. In this case, the analysis of the progression of CMV* over the time points is far more suitable. Therefore, the sum of the changes of the network metabolites of each metabolic pathway (CPV) was also considered. A typical result of CPV calculation applied to the yeast cell cycle dataset is shown in Fig. 6 .

From Soup: 45 The yeast datasets have been analyzed in many publications and a direct comparison would be helpful for the evaluation of the proposed method. However, a direct comparison was not applicable due to the different approaches of the analysis. Usually, the results of transcriptomic data analysis are presented in Gene-Ontology (GO) terms, which show the major functions of the genes. In this work, the analysis was carried out on the level of the networks metabolites and therefore the results are presented in KEGG metabolic pathways. These categories were also used by Rahnenführer et al. 24 They identified 16 significant pathways in an amino acid starvation experiment with yeast and 19 significant pathways in a nitrogen starvation experiment from Gasch et al. 22 By application of the proposed method on these datasets, 15 pathways were identified to be relevant for the amino acid experiment and 9 for the nitrogen starvation experiment using the systematic calculation of ΔCMV, applying a p -value cut-off of 0.005. More than 50% of the pathways that we identified in the amino acid starvation and the nitrogen experiment directly belong to the metabolism of amino acids, whereas in the analysis of the amino acid starvation dataset, three identified pathways showed an overlap with those identified by Rahnenführer et al. 24 In the nitrogen dataset we could confirm seven of the pathways. As they have discussed for nitrogen starvation, pantothenate metabolism belongs to the nitrogen metabolism in the cell. Schwartz et al. 19 presented three pathways for amino acid and two for nitrogen starvation. The comparison of our results to the work of Schwartz et al. 19 showed no accordance in the amino acid and nitrogen dataset when using the p -value cut-off 0.005.

From Soup: 46 They have identified only pathways from the carbohydrate metabolism when analyzing the heat shock data from Gasch et al. , 22 whereas the analysis of the transcriptomic data from cells exposed to heat using our method revealed relevant pathways of the lipid metabolism with high significance. From the pathways identified by Schwartz et al. , 19 galactose, starch and sucrose, as well as fructose and mannose metabolism, were all determined not to be relevant according to our method ( p -value >0.4). Only pyruvate metabolism (3.1 × 10 −2 ) and the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway (8.6 × 10 −3 ) showed an acceptable p -value after pathway enrichment. The lipid metabolism plays an important role in the response of cells to heat shock. 25,26 Fatty acids are responsible for the membrane fluidity of the cell and are regulated when changing the temperature. 27 Arachidonic acid plays a crucial role in the activation of the heat shock response in inflammatory processes in humans. 28 It has also been reported that the Ca 2+ efflux from mitochondria, induced by polyunsaturated fatty acids, requires the heat shock protein 90beta1 (hsp90beta1) in the human teratocarcinoma cells. 29

From Soup: 48 We used our method for the analysis of synchronized yeast cell data for the investigation of cell cycle related metabolic pathways. For this purpose, the calculation of ΔCMV is not suitable, as described previously. Therefore, we analyzed the data using CPV calculation. For each cell cycle phase, different genes are well known whose expression fluctuate with this phase. The genes that were chosen to represent each cell cycle phase are: CLN1 for G1, CIN8 for S and CLB1 for G2/M.

From Soup: 49 The results of the CPV calculation from the application of the method on synchronized yeast cells from Cho et al. 23 are shown in Fig. 6 . Our analysis predicts that metabolic pathways of the lipid metabolism show similar progression to G1 phase genes. The time course of the fatty acid elongation pathway in mitochondria depicted in Fig. 6a and c shows the normalized expression of the G1 phase gene CLN2 and the G2/M phase gene CLB1 for comparison. Mainly fatty acid elongation in mitochondria, fatty acid metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids show changes according to the G1 phase. A clear but smaller peak is also observable for all these pathways in the G2/M phase. Fatty acids are responsible for the properties of the cell wall, as described in Section 4.2.2. They take part in the division of the cell and are supposed to play a key role in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and thus fatty acids are essential for the cell to proceed from the G1 to the S phase. 30,31 Sterols were stated to be one important group of the lipids for cell cycle control. 30,32,33 In our analysis, single network metabolites of this pathway show clear peaks in their change during the G1 phase and others in the S phase, although no correlating time course is found for the whole steroid metabolism. When interpreting the curves of the central energy metabolism during the yeast cell cycle, like the oxidative phosphorylation ( Fig. 6b ), the progression of CPV primarily follows the S phase gene CIN8 . At t = 90 min the progression of map00190 correlates clearly with the S phase gene, although the peak at t = 110 min could be assigned to the G1 phase. In general most of the network metabolites exhibit a slightly shifted second peak as it is also visible in Fig. 6a .

From Soup: 50 It has been stated that the central energy metabolism shows high activity at the end of G1 phase. 23,34 Futcher 34 discussed an ‘energy burst’ when the cell passes the G1 phase. This leads to high activity of pathways like glycolysis, TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. During the S phase, the metabolism of the cell is dedicated to histone and DNA synthesis and the overall biosynthesis is lowered. 35 These findings have a direct effect on cell growth. The cell grows in size in the G1 and G2 phases. 36 When passing to the G2 phase, biosynthesis within the cell increases and the central metabolism could show a change in its activity. In our findings, the network metabolites of the pathways TCA cycle and glycolysis (data not shown) mainly show analogies to S phase genes, which does not clearly support the statements of Cho et al. 23 and Futcher, 34 where the highest change occurs at the end of G1 phase.

From Soup: 51 We proposed a new method for the analysis of transcriptomic data using a metabolic network that exploits a priori structural knowledge of metabolic pathways. Hence, it allows for a more reliable analysis of microarray data since the connectivity of the reactions is taken into account. We illustrated the performance of the proposed method with a simplified artificial network and proved the reliability in a biological way by its application to different transcriptomic datasets from yeast available in the literature using a yeast specific network. Our analysis demonstrated the ability of this method to reveal systematically relevant pathways of the metabolism, which are influenced under the given experimental conditions. The analysis of data from cells that were subjected to different kinds of stress revealed pathways that are closely related to the key metabolism of the cell. In the analysis of the yeast cell cycle, pathways of the lipid metabolism, which have high impact in the regulation of the cell cycle, were identified.

From Soup: 52 Two different analysis procedures were presented: ΔCMV and CPV. The ΔCMV calculation offers a way to obtain results in a simple form. However, it does not allow for the time-dependent evaluation of the metabolic pathways. This is targeted by the investigation of the time course of the different pathways using CPV, which is created by the time courses of its associated network metabolites. The method is comparative and therefore shows the influence, e.g. , of heat shock on the activity of metabolic pathways of the cell.
