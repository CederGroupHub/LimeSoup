From cou.: 1 The solubility of artemisinin in a range of conventional and novel solvents was evaluated using the COSMO-RS approach, and verified experimentally as well as against literature data. The computational method was improved by calibrating against a limited set of experimental data, enhancing the accuracy of the calculations. The optimised method was shown to be in reasonable agreement with experimental data; however, lack of reliable experimental data is identified as an issue. Several novel solvents perceived as green alternatives to conventional solvents were targeted and shown to offer good solubility of artemisinin. Extraction from Artemisia annua by carbonate solvents was experimentally verified.

From cou.: 2 Extraction of natural products is performed on a large scale for production of nutraceuticals, fragrances, biopharmaceuticals, bio-fuels and other products.

From cou.: 3 Extraction processes are traditionally based on solid–liquid extraction. A solvent needs to penetrate the (usually pre-dried) plant material to dissolve the target components, allowing subsequent recovery. Steam distillation and hot water extraction allow the extraction of essential oils and some natural dyes. However, the vast majority of extraction processes utilise organic solvents, predominantly ethanol, hexane, or particular petroleum fractions, e.g., petroleum ether (PE) 60/90. Only a small number of industrial extraction processes are currently using green solvents, mainly supercritical carbon dioxide e.g., in the high-volume process of decaffeination of coffee or the extraction of rice bran oil.

From cou.: 4 Amongst the many natural product extraction processes, extraction of bio-pharmaceutical molecules is of particular importance due to the end-use demand. Thus, plants contribute to over half the library of small molecules of interest to the pharmaceutical industry.1 As an example, extraction of artemisinin (1)—the precursor to the current main antimalarial drugs—is currently its main source and is done predominantly via PE extraction.2 This process is characterised by a relatively low overall yield, typically about 60% with respect to the dried plant content of artemisinin, which is largely due to the decomposition of artemisinin in hot extract solutions and the difficult recovery of artemisinin from the primary extracts. The difficult recovery is, in part, related to the presence of structurally similar co-metabolites and artemisinin degradation products, and also due to the presence of highly efficient solubility enhancers in the waxy and glycosidic fractions of the extract. There are significant health and safety risks associated with the large-scale use of solvents such as n-hexane and PE. These are due to the abnormally high toxicity of n-hexane among linear alkanes3 and the explosion risk through static discharge in the low dielectric constant solvents. The latter requires addition of polar additives, typically 5% v/v of ethyl acetate.

From cou.: 5 There is a considerable interest in developing cleaner extraction processes, or in attempting to reduce solvent use in natural product extraction. Supercritical fluids, with emphasis on supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2), have been shown to be effective extraction solvents for many natural products; scCO2 is particularly attractive for biomedical applications due to the absence of any solvent residue. The main downside is the high capital investment due to the high pressures and temperatures required to attain efficient solvent strength. High investment costs can only be justified for either large enterprises with high-volume single component extraction, or multi-purpose facilities for high-value components.

From cou.: 6 Hydrofluorocarbons exhibit good solvation power at low pressures. Solvents such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane R134a (trade names KLEA-134a, SOLKANE®134a)4 and iodotrifluoromethane5 have already found limited commercial use, even though these solvents are expensive. Further issues are potential in-use toxicity of iodotrifluoromethane6,7 (see discussion in ref. 2, also), very high global warming potential of tetrafluoroethane R134a and a rather complicated situation with patents covering its use for bio-extraction, which has been the issue of much consternation over the last five years. We have shown previously that extraction of artemisinin by R134a is a potentially highly efficient and economic method, assuming quantitative solvent recycling is designed into the process.2

From cou.: 7 Another class of interesting compounds are high boiling point solvents, such as ionic liquids, molten eutectics, carbonates, fluorinated solvents, etc. These are already known in commercial applications resulting in significant reductions in the release of volatile organic carbons (VOCs) through the substitution of low boiling solvents by higher boiling point solvents with considerably lower vapour pressures. However, the use of such solvents in extraction requires completely different processing approaches due to the generally high viscosity of these solvents and the need to use phase separation or extraction for recovery of the required molecules from the primary extracts. A recent life cycle assessment (LCA) study showed that downstream extraction is energetically less efficient than distillation, the latter being used in the case of low boiling point solvents.8 Therefore, we argue that high boiling point solvents should be applied only when their use offers a substantial functional benefit, offsetting any additional process ‘costs’ due to more complex and energy-intensive downstream separation.

From cou.: 9 With the introduction of a large number of new molecules as potential solvents, the problem of rapid evaluation of their usefulness in specific applications emerges. This can be done using time-consuming traditional laboratory methods, using novel high-throughput experimental methods, or by combining experimental measurements with initial pre-screening by computational tools. In this respect, the relatively recent method of calculating solvent performance using ab initio quantum chemical calculations combined with statistical thermodynamics (COSMO-RS)18–20 started to be used extensively in academia, and especially in industry.21–24 A recent review on solvent selection demonstrates the possible links between different molecular design tools and performance screening by COSMO-RS, thus expanding the potential molecular space for solvent screening even further.25 There are, however, only a few reports on the applicability of COSMO-RS for solids solubility calculations, not expanding into the area of green solvents.19,26,27 It has recently been highlighted that although the potential of COSMO-RS in property prediction and the design of solvent systems is very high, experience with applications of the method is thus far very limited.28

From cou.: 11 The initial molecular geometry of artemisinin, epiartemisinin and other molecules that were not available in the COSMOtherm database were set up in Spartan (v. 06, 08). Equilibrium conformer calculation and conformer distribution search were performed in Spartan (v. 06, 08) using the molecular mechanics (MMFF) and semi-empirical AM1 methods. Up to 10 lowest energy conformers were used for the molecules calculated in this study. Geometry optimisation and calculation of screening charge density for all conformers were done in Turbomole using BP-TZVP parameterisation. Consecutive calculations within COSMO-RS theory were performed in COSMOtherm (X_C21_0108 by COSMOLogic GmbH). The conformer treatment option was always employed.

From Soup: 35 As noted in ref. 19 , the problem of solubility calculation with COSMO-RS is the need to obtain a value of the Gibbs energy of fusion (Δ G fus ) of a substance of interest, which is the difference between the Gibbs energy of a pure solid and a pure liquid at a given temperature. Since this value cannot be measured directly, it can be estimated by a QSPR approach, as implemented in COSMOtherm. The QSPR estimate will introduce a considerable error, as will be shown below. Therefore, in this paper, we used a different method to estimate Δ G fus .
 ###### 
From cou.: 36 G
From Soup: 36 Eqn (1) contains two unknowns: Δ i , s and Δ G fus, i . The Δ i , s value can be found from a fine-grid liquid–liquid equilibrium ( LLE ) calculation in COSMOtherm. The resultant liquid phase chemical potential of a solute in the given solvent as a function of its molar fraction is shown in Fig. 1 , calculated for ethanol and ethyl acetate . As expected, the graphs coincide at the point of pure artemisinin and epiartemisinin, see Fig. 1 , x = 1.0. The difference between the chemical potentials of artemisinin and epiartemisinin in solution is more pronounced in the case of ethyl acetate , being ca . 1.353 kJ mol −1 at artemisinin mole fraction x artemisinin = 0.033, whereas the corresponding difference in the case of ethanol solution is only 0.451 kJ mol −1 at x artemisinin = 0.0024. The chemical potential of the solute at the experimentally verified value of its solubility limit concentration ( x i ), at a given temperature, for compound i allows the value of Δ i , s to be obtained.
 ###### 
From cou.: 37 i
From Soup: 37 Based on the calculated value of Δ i , s , the value of Δ G fus can be readily obtained from eqn (1) . Using this methodology and the literature data of solubility of artemisinin in ethanol and ethyl acetate given in Table 1 , the estimated values for Δ G fus were found to be 11.39 and 8.91 kJ mol −1 for the solubilities in ethanol and ethyl acetate , respectively. The value of Δ G fus predicted by the COSMOtherm QSPR approach is 7.16 kJ mol −1 . The original experimental value of solubility in ethyl acetate used to determine the Gibbs fusion value (ref. 2) was later found to be incorrect, in fact too high, which explains the difference between the estimated values of Δ G fus based on ethanol and ethyl acetate experimental solubilities given above. Notably, the solubility of artemisinin in ethyl acetate calculated using Δ G fus = 11.39 coincides well with the more accurate experimental value, see Table 1 . This illustrates the frequently encountered problem of low confidence in available experimental data and the potential for computational results to point out the likely erroneous experimental results.

From Soup: 39 Artemisia annua biomass was of East African and Argentinian origin. Artemisinin was kindly provided by Neem Biotech Ltd (Newport, Wales, UK). Exhaustive extraction was performed to determine the amount of artemisinin in the dry biomass. Extracts of A. annua were typically prepared using a ratio of 10 g of dry finely crushed biomass to 100 mL of solvent ( ethyl acetate ). Extractions were performed at 45 °C under reflux over 6 h. Extracts were filtered through filter paper, and later filtered using a 0.2 μm Nylon filter prior to HPLC analysis. An HPLC instrument (Shimadzu Prominence) equipped with a UV-vis diode array (SPD-M20A, DAD ) and in-line evaporative light scattering detector ( ELSD , LTII, 350 kPa N 2 , nebulizer at 40 °C) was used with Betasil C18 5 μm 250 × 4.6 mm at column flow-rate 1.0 mL min −1 and column temperature of 45 °C with acetonitrile : water 65 : 35% v/v. Analytical method development is described elsewhere. 30

From cou.: 40 Eqn (1) contains two unknowns: Δi,s and ΔGfus,i. The Δi,s value can be found from a fine-grid liquid–liquid equilibrium (LLE) calculation in COSMOtherm.

The chemical potential of the solute at the experimentally verified value of its solubility limit concentration (xi), at a given temperature, for compound i allows the value of Δi,s to be obtained.
From Soup: 40 Hexane/ ethyl acetate (95 : 5 v/v) and carbonates extraction kinetics were measured using a 1 L glass double-jacketed stirred vessel (Büchi). Extraction was performed at 50 °C for 5 h with the ratio of biomass to solvent 1 : 6 (w : v). Samples of 1 mL were taken along the extraction experiment to follow artemisinin concentration in the solvents over time. At the end of an experiment, the extract was evaporated to dryness, and the residue was re-dissolved in acetonitrile and analysed to determine the maximum amount of artemisinin extracted. In parallel, the remaining biomass was extracted twice with a fresh volume of ethyl acetate for three hours in each sequence. Then, the two extracts were combined, evaporated to dryness and the residue was re-dissolved in acetonitrile and analysed to determine the quantity of artemisinin not accessible for extraction . All samples were filtered using a 4 μm Nylon syringe filter before injection in HPLC .

From Soup: 41 In the case of solvents with high vapour pressure, the solubility of artemisinin was measured using a gravimetric method, using a set of thermostated vials at 293 K. The solvent (5 mL) was added to the vials and once the desired temperature was reached, excess artemisinin (considering the expected solubility) was added and the vials sealed. The suspension was stirred at 300–400 rpm with a magnetic stirrer for 6 h, which was considered sufficient to establish the equilibrium of the solute– solvent mixture. Samples of the solution were withdrawn rapidly using a micropipette to avoid any solvent loss or precipitation . The aliquots were filtered with pre-warmed 0.22 μm Nylon filters, solutions placed in vials brought to constant weights and transferred to a vacuum oven. Solutions were evaporated and vials were brought to constant weight. All weights were measured using a Sartorius microbalance with accuracy better than 0.05 mg. Experiments were performed in duplicate. Samples were also diluted and analysed using the HPLC instrument with a UV DAD detector set at 210 nm to verify the results of gravimetric measurements.

From Soup: 42 For the solvents with higher boiling points, the solubility of artemisinin was measured at 293 K in approximately 5 g of a given solvent . An excess of artemisinin was placed in a solvent in a sealed glass vial and gently stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 6 h, thermostated in a water bath. The suspension was allowed to settle and a sample was taken for analysis via a 0.5 μm Nylon syringe filter. The sample was injected into the HPLC instrument directly.

From cou.: 44 Hexane/ethyl acetate (95:5 v/v) and carbonates extraction kinetics were measured using a 1 L glass double-jacketed stirred vessel (Büchi). Extraction was performed at 50 °C for 5 h with the ratio of biomass to solvent 1:6 (w:v). Samples of 1 mL were taken along the extraction experiment to follow artemisinin concentration in the solvents over time.

All samples were filtered using a 4 μm Nylon syringe filter before injection in HPLC.
From Soup: 44 The initial geometry was built using the absolute conformation determined from single crystal diffraction 31 and the earlier computational work 32 as guidance. Two diastereoisomers of artemisinin are considered in the literature: 32 artemisinin ( 1 ) and epiartemisinin ( 2 ), see Scheme 1 . Both isomers are derivatised into arteether and artesunate APIs and it was shown that the pharmacokinetics of the resultant diastereomers of arteether is different, one being considerably slower than the other. 33 Although this was considered advantageous by the authors, the short life-time of the active artemisinin compound is believed to be an essential reason for malaria parasites being unable to develop tolerance towards artemisinin -based drugs over significant periods of time. We therefore considered both diastereoisomers in our calculations.

Experiments were performed in duplicate. Samples were also diluted and analysed using the HPLC instrument with a UV DAD detector set at 210 nm to verify the results of gravimetric measurements.
From Soup: 45 The search for equilibrium conformers yielded two conformers for each of the two isomers. Thus, four structures were used for further geometry optimisation using density functional theory. The resultant molecular geometry could, in principle, be compared against experimental crystal diffraction data 31 and the previous computational study. 32 However, the geometry of a molecule in the liquid state is different from its gas phase structure or its solid crystal structure due to the presence of intermolecular interactions and, at the same time, their flexibility. Therefore, such direct comparison is not very meaningful. It was noted in the calculations that for both diastereoisomers, only one conformer contributed significantly to the calculated values of solubility. The two important conformers are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI † ).

From cou.: 46 For the solvents with higher boiling points, the solubility of artemisinin was measured at 293 K in approximately 5 g of a given solvent. An excess of artemisinin was placed in a solvent in a sealed glass vial and gently stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 6 h, thermostated in a water bath. The suspension was allowed to settle and a sample was taken for analysis via a 0.5 μm Nylon syringe filter. The sample was injected into the HPLC instrument directly.
From Soup: 46 The calculated COSMO-RS parameters, the screening charge density distribution profile and surface chemical potential distribution, as functions of screening charge density, are shown in Fig. 2a . A phenomenological analysis of the resultant data can be given following a similar analysis of common solvents given earlier. 18 The large peak of P x ( σ ) near σ = 0 corresponds to a non-polarised area of the molecule, mostly carbon and hydrogen atoms, whereas the complex peak at 1.25 e nm −2 corresponds to the peroxide oxygen atoms (at ca. 1 e nm −2 ) and to the lactone oxygen (at ca. 1.25 e nm −2 ). Complementary profiles for the two liquids, i.e. matching the maxima of one component at a sigma value − σ with the maxima of another at + σ , would indicate their miscibility. A similar analysis for a solvent and solute pair would indicate mutual affinity and hence indicate potentially good solubility.

From cou.: 47 The structures of the compounds used as possible solvents are given in Scheme S1 in the ESI†. Carbonates (4–6, Scheme S1, ESI†) were kindly provided by Huntsman Chemicals. All other solvents were obtained from Fischer Chemicals. All solvents were used as received.
From Soup: 47 The surface chemical potentials at positive and negative polarisations correspond to capacities towards hydrogen bond accepting and donating behaviour, see Fig. 2b . This analysis is normally done for solvents , rather than solutes. However, the phenomenological analysis should also be valid for solutes. For interpretation, it is necessary to keep in mind that the sign of polarity in Fig. 2b corresponds to the screening charge and, hence, is opposite to the polarity of the molecule. Negative polarity corresponds to interactions with hydrogen donors , which shows that artemisinin will interact with hydrogen donors through its exposed lone pairs in oxygen atoms. However, it would not interact with hydrogen bonding acceptors, since it does not have considerable exposed area of polarised hydrogen donors . Solvents with a large number of strong hydrogen bond acceptors should not have high solvation power for artemisinin . In the positive polarity range, artemisinin would behave as hexane or acetone . Thus, it is expected that artemisinin should interact strongly with polar solvents containing few or weak hydrogen bonding donors, for example trichloromethane .
 ###### 
From cou.: 48 The initial geometry was built using the absolute conformation determined from single crystal diffraction31 and the earlier computational work32 as guidance. Two diastereoisomers of artemisinin are considered in the literature:32 artemisinin (1) and epiartemisinin (2), see Scheme 1. Both isomers are derivatised into arteether and artesunate APIs and it was shown that the pharmacokinetics of the resultant diastereomers of arteether is different, one being considerably slower than the other.33 Although this was considered advantageous by the authors, the short life-time of the active artemisinin compound is believed to be an essential reason for malaria parasites being unable to develop tolerance towards artemisinin-based drugs over significant periods of time. We therefore considered both diastereoisomers in our calculations.
From Soup: 48 The clear difference between artemisinin diastereoisomers in the surface potential at negative polarity is noteworthy; there is a clear difference between the potentials even if averaged over the two conformers for each isomer. Epiartemisinin ( 2 ) shows a stronger tendency to hydrogen bond donor interactions. Thus, the two isomers should behave differently in solvents with hydrogen bonding donor functions, epiartemisinin always interacting the stronger.
 ###### 
From cou.: 49 The search for equilibrium conformers yielded two conformers for each of the two isomers. Thus, four structures were used for further geometry optimisation using density functional theory. The resultant molecular geometry could, in principle, be compared against experimental crystal diffraction data31 and the previous computational study.32 However, the geometry of a molecule in the liquid state is different from its gas phase structure or its solid crystal structure due to the presence of intermolecular interactions and, at the same time, their flexibility. Therefore, such direct comparison is not very meaningful. It was noted in the calculations that for both diastereoisomers, only one conformer contributed significantly to the calculated values of solubility. The two important conformers are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
From Soup: 49 Calculation of solubility of artemisinin based on QSPR estimated free energy of fusion gives significantly over-estimated values for all solvents , see Table 1 . When the value of Δ G fus , calculated on the basis of experimental solubility of ethanol and the computed LLE data was used (= 11.39 kJ mol −1 , see Experimental section), then the estimated value of solubility in ethanol matched the experimental value within 2%. The calculated data hint at inaccuracies in previously reported experimental data . Thus, the earlier reported figures of solubilities in n-hexane and ethyl acetate 2 differ markedly from the calculated data, see Table 1 . However, our own recent measurements are in agreement with calculations and with other literature data. 34

From cou.: 50 The calculated COSMO-RS parameters, the screening charge density distribution profile and surface chemical potential distribution, as functions of screening charge density, are shown in Fig. 2a. A phenomenological analysis of the resultant data can be given following a similar analysis of common solvents given earlier.18 The large peak of Px(σ) near σ = 0 corresponds to a non-polarised area of the molecule, mostly carbon and hydrogen atoms, whereas the complex peak at 1.25 e nm−2 corresponds to the peroxide oxygen atoms (at ca. 1 e nm−2) and to the lactone oxygen (at ca. 1.25 e nm−2). Complementary profiles for the two liquids, i.e. matching the maxima of one component at a sigma value −σ with the maxima of another at +σ, would indicate their miscibility. A similar analysis for a solvent and solute pair would indicate mutual affinity and hence indicate potentially good solubility.
From Soup: 50 Prediction of solubility in the mixed water – ethanol solvent with the optimised value of Δ G fus shows a reasonably good match, the calculated solubility being systematically higher than the experimental values, see Fig. 3 . Only for pure water is the calculated value of solubility lower than the reported experimental value. 35
 ###### 
From cou.: 51 The surface chemical potentials at positive and negative polarisations correspond to capacities towards hydrogen bond accepting and donating behaviour, see Fig. 2b. This analysis is normally done for solvents, rather than solutes. However, the phenomenological analysis should also be valid for solutes. For interpretation, it is necessary to keep in mind that the sign of polarity in Fig. 2b corresponds to the screening charge and, hence, is opposite to the polarity of the molecule. Negative polarity corresponds to interactions with hydrogen donors, which shows that artemisinin will interact with hydrogen donors through its exposed lone pairs in oxygen atoms. However, it would not interact with hydrogen bonding acceptors, since it does not have considerable exposed area of polarised hydrogen donors. Solvents with a large number of strong hydrogen bond acceptors should not have high solvation power for artemisinin. In the positive polarity range, artemisinin would behave as hexane or acetone. Thus, it is expected that artemisinin should interact strongly with polar solvents containing few or weak hydrogen bonding donors, for example trichloromethane.
From Soup: 51 Using the published experimental data on the temperature dependence of artemisinin solubility in ethanol 36 the temperature dependence of the Gibbs free energy of fusion of artemisinin was calculated. This was done by obtaining a linear fit to the experimental data of solubility plotted as log( x ) vs T , and finding the best value of Δ G fus at each temperature point that gave the closest calculated solubility value. The resultant data are shown in Fig. 4 .
 ###### 
From cou.: 52 The clear difference between artemisinin diastereoisomers in the surface potential at negative polarity is noteworthy; there is a clear difference between the potentials even if averaged over the two conformers for each isomer. Epiartemisinin (2) shows a stronger tendency to hydrogen bond donor interactions. Thus, the two isomers should behave differently in solvents with hydrogen bonding donor functions, epiartemisinin always interacting the stronger.
From Soup: 52 It is apparent that without a temperature dependence of the free energy of fusion, estimation of the solubility of artemisinin is correct only within a very narrow range of temperatures around the reference temperature T ref = 294 K at which Δ G fus was determined. More accurate calculations could be obtained by fitting the calculated solubility values to the experimental data by adjusting Δ G fus . The interpolated values for the temperature dependence of the Gibbs energy of fusion for 1 and 2 were used in all consecutive calculations. The temperature dependence of Δ G fus is computed within COSMOtherm using the following equation: 29

From cou.: 53 Calculation of solubility of artemisinin based on QSPR estimated free energy of fusion gives significantly over-estimated values for all solvents, see Table 1.

From Soup: 66 There are several outlying values of solubilities in Table 1 where there is a considerable difference between experiment and calculations, particularly in the case of toluene and acetonitrile. On one hand it is expected that the accuracy of calculation for very high solubilities would not be particularly high. On the other hand, such significant discrepancies may invalidate the method of calculation and should be examined more closely.

From Soup: 68 Solubility calculations were performed for artemisinin and epiartemisinin. However, more detailed calculations with dry and wet solvents were only performed for artemisinin .

This value was used in all subsequent calculations at this temperature.

From Soup: 69 Results of the computational screening of a number of solvents that have not previously been considered for extraction of artemisinin , as well as some more common solvents , are shown in Table 2 . The only solvents included in the analysis that score very badly in the GSK solvent selection guide 38 are chloroform , dichloromethane and acetonitrile.

From cou.: 70 There are several outlying values of solubilities in Table 1 where there is a considerable difference between experiment and calculations, particularly in the case of toluene and acetonitrile.

On the other hand, such significant discrepancies may invalidate the method of calculation and should be examined more closely. These are discussed below within the discussion of specific groups of solvents.
From Soup: 70 There appears to be little difference between the n-alkanes of C 5 –C 7 chain length. Calculations predict a 30% lower solubility in n-heptane compared to n-hexane , which is somewhat unfortunate, due to its 10-fold lower toxicity. 3 The parity with experimental data is also very good for linear alkanes. However, pure linear alkanes are rarely used in practical applications. The more common solvents , being the particular grades of petroleum ether ( PE ), characterised by the range of boiling temperatures PE 60–90 with the density range 0.67–0.698 g ml −1 and consisting of n-pentane , 2-methylpentane , n-hexane , n-heptane and isopentane (0.25 : 0.25 : 0.25 : 0.23 : 0.02), were used in the calculations of artemisinin solubility. As expected solubility in PE ranked between that of n-pentane and n-heptane . The presence of aromatic impurities in PE would increase the solubility of artemisinin , according to both calculations and experimental data .
 ###### 
From cou.: 71 Two conclusions can be drawn from these initial results: (1) the accuracy and quality of experimental data can be verified by the calculated data, allowing to identify non-linear behaviour and allowing further experimental planning and (2) the presence of water in mixed solvents, even in such highly complex polar systems as ethanol–water, can be described accurately by the model; thus, the solubility of artemisinin in wet solvents could also be estimated.
From Soup: 71 The move to aromatic solvents such as toluene results in a marked increase in the predicted and experimental solubilities of artemisinin . The screening charge density of toluene is higher in both polarity ranges than that of linear alkanes. The recently reported value of artemisinin solubility in toluene (145.6 g L −1 , ref. 34 ) is 10-fold higher than the predicted value. This value was obtained by light scattering measurements, based on the disappearance of artemisinin crystallites from solution upon gradual addition of solvent . 34

From cou.: 72 Solubility calculations were performed for artemisinin and epiartemisinin. However, more detailed calculations with dry and wet solvents were only performed for artemisinin. The value of ΔGfus of artemisinin at 293 K was estimated to be 11.83 kJ mol−1 on the basis of the temperature dependence shown in Fig. 4. This value was used in all subsequent calculations at this temperature.
From Soup: 72 We attempted to measure several solubilities by using a gravimetric method and verified the results by diluting samples and using a UV-DAD detector in the HPLC instrument; the obtained data are reported in Tables 1 and 2 . The accuracy of gravimetric measurements is not very high due to the errors in determining the mass of rapidly evaporating solvents . However, there was a good agreement between gravimetric measurements and HPLC-UV concentration measurements for the solubilities of artemisinin in toluene , acetonitrile and dimethylformamide .

From cou.: 73 Results of the computational screening of a number of solvents that have not previously been considered for extraction of artemisinin, as well as some more common solvents, are shown in Table 2. The only solvents included in the analysis that score very badly in the GSK solvent selection guide 38 are chloroform, dichloromethane and acetonitrile.
From Soup: 73 The value of solubility obtained in toluene is significantly lower than that reported in ref. 34 . In contrast, the value of solubility in acetonitrile is much higher. Our measured values correlate much better with the trend in the calculated values. Therefore, we have much more confidence in the order of experimental solubilities obtained in our own measurements. There is a concern that the light scattering method of determining solubilities introduces a systematic error due to an incorrect interpretation of the signal, since this is an indirect method. This error can be different for different solvent systems. It would therefore be necessary to validate experimental values of solubilities of artemisinin in toluene and several other solvents showing apparently high solubilities by a different, direct, reliable and independently validated method.

As expected solubility in PE ranked between that of n-pentane and n-heptane. The presence of aromatic impurities in PE would increase the solubility of artemisinin, according to both calculations and experimental data.
From Soup: 74 The large underprediction of the artemisinin solubility in toluene may arise from the inability of the theory to correctly account for the interactions of π-electrons of the aromatic ring of toluene with the unpaired spins of oxygens in artemisinin . Some of these interactions appear to be accounted for. This is evident in comparison of the homologous order of solvents from toluene to trifluorotoluene , perfluorotoluene and perfluoromethyl cyclohexane . There is a strong correlation between the decrease in the number of protons , the decrease in the π electron density, and the reduced solubility of artemisinin . Fig. S2 in the ESI † illustrates the differences in the screening charge densities of toluene and perfluorotoluene .

From cou.: 75 The move to aromatic solvents such as toluene results in a marked increase in the predicted and experimental solubilities of artemisinin. The screening charge density of toluene is higher in both polarity ranges than that of linear alkanes. The recently reported value of artemisinin solubility in toluene (145.6 g L−1, ref. 34) is 10-fold higher than the predicted value. This value was obtained by light scattering measurements, based on the disappearance of artemisinin crystallites from solution upon gradual addition of solvent.34
From Soup: 75 Amongst all screened solvents , the highest solubilities of artemisinin were predicted for chloroform and dichloromethane —two orders of magnitude higher than those for the standard extraction solvents n-hexane or PE . The experimental value of solubility in chloroform is 8% higher than the calculated value ( Table 1 ). In our opinion this is a very good correlation, since the accuracy of calculations generally decreases at high solubilities. A very high solubility was calculated and experimentally verified for carvacrol , 245–298 g L −1 .

However, there was a good agreement between gravimetric measurements and HPLC-UV concentration measurements for the solubilities of artemisinin in toluene, acetonitrile and dimethylformamide.
From Soup: 76 The next best solvents according to the predicted values are liquid tetrafluoromethane , liquid CO 2 and the symmetrical 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane . There are no experimental data on the solubility of artemisinin in liquid CO 2 but there are data on its solubility in scCO 2 . 39 Some experimental conditions reported are close to the density of liquid CO 2 at 293 K. Using the empirical relationship for solubility as a function of density and temperature developed in ref. 38 , the experimental solubility of artemisinin at 293 K and density 770 g L −1 is estimated as y = 5.65 × 10 −4 or 2.79 g L −1 . There is a very large discrepancy between the calculated solubility of artemisinin in liquid CO 2 and the experimental solubility at close temperature and pressure, but in scCO 2 . At this stage we cannot present an adequate explanation for this difference.

From Soup: 77 The predicted solubility in liquid ammonia is quite high. This is an expected result since ammonia is known to be a very good solvent . However, its practical use as a solvent is unlikely due to safety considerations and its basic character, which would promote undesirable decomposition reactions of the compounds of interest in the extracts. The inert hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants may potentially be good solvents . The commercially available unsymmetrical 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is already being used as a solvent for bio- extraction processes and was earlier shown to be economically and environmentally competitive against other extraction processes. 2

From cou.: 78 The large underprediction of the artemisinin solubility in toluene may arise from the inability of the theory to correctly account for the interactions of π-electrons of the aromatic ring of toluene with the unpaired spins of oxygens in artemisinin. Some of these interactions appear to be accounted for. This is evident in comparison of the homologous order of solvents from toluene to trifluorotoluene, perfluorotoluene and perfluoromethyl cyclohexane. There is a strong correlation between the decrease in the number of protons, the decrease in the π electron density, and the reduced solubility of artemisinin. Fig. S2 in the ESI† illustrates the differences in the screening charge densities of toluene and perfluorotoluene.
From Soup: 78 The difference in the predicted solubility of artemisinin in the symmetrical 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane and unsymmetrical 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is nearly 100%. Intuitively, the unsymmetrical isomer of tetrafluoroethane would be assigned as more polar. However, the σ profiles of the molecules suggest that the symmetrical isomer is the more polar of the two, with more negative and more positive surface charge areas, see Fig. 5 . There is a better match for both the positive and the negative polarity peaks of artemisinin and 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane on the surface charge density scale ( x axis). Unfortunately, the symmetrical tetrafluoroethane is not available commercially. The other symmetrical molecule of the same class which is commercially available is heptafluoropropane ( 13 , ESI † ), but even though its hydrogen carries a higher charge density than 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane , the predicted solubility is only 28% higher, as only one polarised hydrogen is available.

From Soup: 79 In the class of solvents with high boiling points, a number of possible solvents were considered from the classes of carbonates, cyclic ethers , urea -based solvents , fatty acid -based solvents and naturally abundant terpenes. Here, we also considered several co-metabolites of artemisinin , which may act as co-solvents or solubility enhancement agents and thus could influence the process of extraction and also consecutive recovery of artemisinin from primary extracts. For a number of components, the optimised screening charge density files were not available in the COSMOTherm library and were computed in this study (structures of numbered compounds given in the ESI † ): butylene carbonate ( 5 ), glycerine carbonate ( 6 ), DMI ( 7 ), DMPU ( 8 ), 1,3-dioxane-5-ol ( 14 ), 2-isobutyl-1,3-dioxane-5-ol ( 15 ), artemisia ketone ( 21 ), flavone casticin and a C 30 paraffin.

From Soup: 80 Table 2 and Fig. 6 show a reasonable correlation in the trend of solubilities between the experimental and predicted values, allowing a ranking of solvents . However, the errors in the absolute values in some cases are considerable, requiring experimental verification.

From these solvents , dimethyl carbonate and DMF have an appreciable vapour pressure and can still be used as conventional solvents with vacuum solvent distillation . All other solvents have very low vapour pressures and therefore a secondary extraction is needed to recover the desired compounds from the raw extracts. Furthermore, some low vapour pressure solvents are too viscous to be used as pure solvents , and could be considered as potential solvent additives.

In the case of [DMEA][oct] the two ion pairs are in equilibrium with the corresponding acid base pair . The calculated solubility for the equimolar mixture of the corresponding pair of DMEA and octanoic acid predicted a much higher value for solubility of artemisinin , although still not as high as the reported experimental value.

From Soup: 82 In the order of solubilities the novel green solvents came between the conventional hydrocarbon solvents , such as n-hexane and petroleum ether at the low end, and the compressed gases and chlorinated solvents at the high end of solubility values. Amongst the new solvents , diacetone alcohol is being used as an acetone replacement in cleaning applications; DMPU, DMI and carbonates are dipolar solvents with low volatility and toxicity. Some of the solvents could be obtained from renewable feedstocks e.g. , DMPU, glyceryl carbonate, ethyl lactate , glycerol isobutyral . 41

From Soup: 83 The predicted solubility of artemisinin in 1,8-cineol is reasonably high in comparison to conventional hydrocarbon solvents —7.2 g L −1 , see Table 2 . It is also a major component of essential oil of A. annua . 42 It is therefore possible that the presence of cineol and other secondary metabolites in the plant would affect solubilisation of artemisinin and its subsequent crystallisation in the work-up procedure. This also opens a new possibility of using natural products , such as light terpenes and some fatty acids, even as mixtures, as solvents for natural products extraction .

Furthermore, some low vapour pressure solvents are too viscous to be used as pure solvents, and could be considered as potential solvent additives.
From Soup: 84 Extraction from biomass is a highly unselective process: the main component is usually co-extracted with a number of secondary metabolites . Thus, PE extraction of A. annua produces a dark brown-green solution containing waxes, light terpenes and chlorophylls, as well as different artemisinin related compounds. Extraction with EtOH produces a solution containing more sugars and other polar compounds. Some of the extracted co-metabolites will influence the consecutive purification steps and can also influence the primary extraction of artemisinin . It has been hypothesised that in the PE -based extraction of artemisinin , the actual extraction agent is not the PE solvent , but the higher polarity compounds that are extracted by PE first, such as terpenes, flavones, small phenolics, fatty acids, waxes, etc .

In the case of [DMEA][oct] the two ion pairs are in equilibrium with the corresponding acid base pair. The calculated solubility for the equimolar mixture of the corresponding pair of DMEA and octanoic acid predicted a much higher value for solubility of artemisinin, although still not as high as the reported experimental value.
From Soup: 85 There exists a reasonable amount of data on the secondary metabolites of A. annua . 42–45 The calculated solubilities of artemisinin in n-hexane – ethyl acetate mixed solvent in the presence of a number of co-metabolites are given in Table 3 . The relative quantities of different metabolites vary strongly with the seed origin, growth conditions and the growing region. Therefore, the estimate of the potential influence of the co-metabolites on the solubility of artemisinin in the modified solvent system is based on the maximum amount of the particular compound reported in the literature. Thus, in the case of 1,8-cineol, the maximum reported content in the essential oil of A. annua is up to 30% (w/w), with the yield of the oil varying between ca . 0.4% w/w and 4.0% v/w. 42 Similarly, the maximum reported quantity of camphor in the essential oil is 21.8%. Based on these data, and assuming that all available co-metabolite is extracted into the solvent mixture, the molar fractions of 1,8-cineol and camphor in the solvent mixture were estimated to be within the range 2.5 × 10 −4 –25 × 10 −4 and 1.9 × 10 −4 –19 × 10 −4 , respectively. In several cases, the major component of essential oil was reported to be artemisia ketone ( 21 , ESI † )—up to 80%. The major fatty acids reported in the A. annua are 16 : 0, 18 : 1, 18 : 2 and 18 : 3, however free fatty acids comprise only ca . 4% of the total lipid content, the major components being C 38 –C 20 saturated and unsaturated linear hydrocarbons. 46 In our own studies we identified 16 : 0 hexadecanoic (palmitic), 14 : 0 tetradecanoic (myristic) and 12 : 0 dodecanoic (lauric) acids as the main fatty acid compounds; dodecanoic acid was used in a representative simulation. The class of flavones is represented by casticin ( 23 , ESI † ), which is often found in A. annua extracts. Flavones, however, are found in extracts free and also with the glycoside function ( 24 , ESI † ), the latter being considerably more polar.
 ###### 
From cou.: 86 In the order of solubilities the novel green solvents came between the conventional hydrocarbon solvents, such as n-hexane and petroleum ether at the low end, and the compressed gases and chlorinated solvents at the high end of solubility values. Amongst the new solvents, diacetone alcohol is being used as an acetone replacement in cleaning applications; DMPU, DMI and carbonates are dipolar solvents with low volatility and toxicity. Some of the solvents could be obtained from renewable feedstocks e.g., DMPU, glyceryl carbonate, ethyl lactate, glycerol isobutyral.41
From Soup: 86 At such low concentrations of the co-extracted secondary metabolites , their effect on the solubility of artemisinin is insignificant, only increasing solubility by up to 2.7%. This implies that consecutive crystallisation would not be considerably affected by the presence of these co-extractants. However, both deoxyartemisinin and the glycoside form of flavone casticin ( 25 and 24 , ESI † ) influence the solubility of artemisinin to a higher degree, up to 7.5% in the case of the flavone . Deoxyartemisinin is one of the stable products of degradation of artemisinin and is frequently found in some A. annua plant materials. The flavone glycoside appears to be a very significant modifier of artemisinin properties in the solvent matrix. It should be expected that other glycosides would have a similar effect. This is a possible reason for difficult crystallisation of artemisinin from ethanol extracts, 47 since ethanol extracts more sugars and other polar compounds.
 ###### 
From cou.: 87 The predicted solubility of artemisinin in 1,8-cineol is reasonably high in comparison to conventional hydrocarbon solvents—7.2 g L−1, see Table 2. It is also a major component of essential oil of A. annua.42 It is therefore possible that the presence of cineol and other secondary metabolites in the plant would affect solubilisation of artemisinin and its subsequent crystallisation in the work-up procedure. This also opens a new possibility of using natural products, such as light terpenes and some fatty acids, even as mixtures, as solvents for natural products extraction.
From Soup: 87 In order to validate the possibility of using alternative greener solvents that were predicted to have high solubility of artemisinin as practical extraction solvents , exhaustive extraction of A. annua dry material was performed with propylene and butylene carbonate solvents , see Fig. 7 . Both solvents gave a high efficiency of extraction , leaving a very small amount of artemisinin in the biomass. Moreover, the obtained extracts were lightly coloured solutions in contrast to darker brown-green hydrocarbon extracts, indicating that very small amounts of heavy compounds and chlorophylls are being extracted. Thus, consecutive separation of artemisinin from such extracts by e.g. , scCO 2 or liquid–liquid or liquid–solid fractionation with an affinity sorbent would yield a high purity product. Integration of extraction of biopharmaceuticals by high boiling point solvents with consecutive downstream processes is a topic of continuing investigation.
 ###### 
From cou.: 88 Extraction from biomass is a highly unselective process: the main component is usually co-extracted with a number of secondary metabolites. Thus, PE extraction of A. annua produces a dark brown-green solution containing waxes, light terpenes and chlorophylls, as well as different artemisinin related compounds. Extraction with EtOH produces a solution containing more sugars and other polar compounds. Some of the extracted co-metabolites will influence the consecutive purification steps and can also influence the primary extraction of artemisinin. It has been hypothesised that in the PE-based extraction of artemisinin, the actual extraction agent is not the PE solvent, but the higher polarity compounds that are extracted by PE first, such as terpenes, flavones, small phenolics, fatty acids, waxes, etc.
From Soup: 88 COSMO-RS was applied to the screening of solvents for the process of extraction of the valuable biopharmaceutical substance artemisinin . The method of calculation was improved by establishing a calibration procedure against a limited number of experimental data points to obtain an accurate value of the Gibbs energy of fusion for the solid substance of interest. Comparison with experimental values shows good accuracy of calculations for most types of molecules, although there are a number of compounds for which the deviation between the calculation and the experimental result is significant. Some experimental data are questioned, since both calculations and alternative experimental procedures yield markedly different results.

From Soup: 89 The computational method was shown to be effective in determining the behaviour of mixed solvent systems and in screening the effects of impurities on the solubilisation process. This should allow further development of the method for optimisation of biopharmaceutical separation processes. Several new green solvents were screened, for which no experimental data were available. This allowed us to identify the most promising solvents . Experimental validation of exhaustive extraction by carbonates shows the potential applicability of the new solvents for developing practical extraction processes for bio- pharmaceuticals .
