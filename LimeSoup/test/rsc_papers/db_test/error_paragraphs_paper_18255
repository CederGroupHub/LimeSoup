From cou.: 1 Density functional calculations at B3LYP/DZVP were used to obtain structural information, relative free energies of different isomers and binding energies for the following reaction in the gas phase: M+ + (glycyl)nglycine → M–(glycyl)nglycine+, where M = Ag or Cu and n = 0–2. For the complexes with Cu+, optimizations were also performed at B3LYP/6–31++G(d,p) and single-point calculations at MP2(fc)/6–311++G(2df,2p)//B3LYP/DZVP. The calculated binding energies for the Cu+ complexes are all higher than those of the structurally similar Ag+ ions. These calculated binding energy differences become larger as the size of the ligand increases. For all the Cu+ complexes examined, the coordination number of the copper ion does not exceed two, whereas for the silver complexes tri- and tetracoordinate Ag+ structures are calculated to be at low energy minima. Significant structural and relative free energy differences occur between the lowest energy ‘zwitterionic ’ forms of the M–(glycyl)nglycine+ complexes.

From cou.: 2 The area of gas-phase transition metal ion chemistry has experienced explosive growth in the recent past.1 This has been stimulated by the importance of transition metal ions in a wide variety of fields, including catalysis, organometallic reactions and especially biochemistry, where metal ions can be very influential in determining the three-dimensional structures of nucleic acids.2–5 For many proteins, a variety of metal ions are required to interact with the appropriate peptides or proteins in order for the latter to be able to carry out their regulatory or structural functions.6 It is therefore imperative that we further our understanding of the interactions of these metal ions with molecules of biological importance.

From cou.: 3 Alkali metal cations, for example, are essential for maintaining osmotic equilibrium in cells; they also play a role in the transport of amino acids through their binding to some proteins.7–9 Transition metal ions, such as Cu(I), also play very important roles in biological processes such as oxidation, dioxygen transport and electron transfer.7,10 Silver(I) compounds, on the other hand, are used as potent antibacterial agents.11 Excluding those of mercury, silver compounds are among the most toxic towards bacteria and other microorganisms. This fact is exploited by the use of silver(I) compounds for medicinal purposes; silver nitrate has been used to combat infantile blindness12 and silver sulfadiazine is commonly found in creams used to treat severe burns and infectious skin diseases.13,14 The role of silver sulfadiazine has been examined and the general agreement is that the action of the drug is due to its ability to release silver ions which are the active species.14 Silver(I) diphosphine complexes have been shown to be potently cytotoxic to cancerous melanoma cells,15 while other silver-containing compounds have been effectively used for treatment of ulcers.16

From cou.: 4 Metal ions can bind to a variety of sites on a peptide, including the amino nitrogen at the N-terminus, the carboxylate anion at the C-terminus, the carbonyl oxygen atoms along the backbone and the side chains of the glutamine and asparagine residues, and the nitrogen atoms on the side chains of basic residues such as lysine, arginine and histidine. Other possible sites of metal ion attachment to peptides include the hydroxyl oxygen atoms on the side chains of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues and the sulfur atoms on the side chains of methionine and cysteine residues. The fact that a variety of metal ions can easily bind to peptides has been exploited in the field of mass spectrometry, where metal ions such as Li+, Na+, Cu+ and Ag+ have been used as ionizing agents for peptide sequencing.17–19 Exploring the nature of these metal ion–peptide interactions will not only provide information on their binding energies to a class of biologically important molecules, but will also be extremely useful in the interpretation of the mass spectra of such complexes obtained either under metastable or ia collision-induced dissociation conditions.

From cou.: 5 The coordination modes of metal ions greatly influence their binding energies and to some extent their site of attachment to a ligand. Some metals have a strong preference for a particular coordination mode, while others can adopt different coordination geometries. These coordination preferences could play a significant role in the biological functions of metal-containing enzymes. The metal-specific binding sites of some proteins achieve their selectivity by providing a coordination environment preferred by only one metal ion naturally found in living systems. As a consequence, some metals that are not naturally found in living systems owe their toxicity to their ability to coordinate strongly and compete effectively for the binding sites of biologically important metal ions.

From cou.: 6 Modeling ion–protein complexes is a difficult task that requires accurate knowledge of the interactions of these ions with amino acids and small peptides. Recently, the kinetic method has been used to obtain ladders of relative Cu+ and Ag+ affinities of almost all essential α-amino acids.20,21 Theoretical studies have also probed the interactions of Cu+ with glycine, cysteine and serine 22,23 and those of Ag+ with all 20 α-amino acids.24 While these studies provide values of the binding energies and some insight into the coordination preferences of these two isoelectronic transition metal ions, no direct comparisons between their interactions with amino acids or peptides have previously been made. This work provides a step towards this goal by means of a comprehensive description of the interaction of Cu+ and Ag+ with each of glycine (G), glycylglycine (GG) and glycylglycylglycine (GGG). Glycine was chosen as several groups have studied its interaction with metal ions, including Cu+, and its binding energy to that ion is well established.22,23 For reasons of computational tractability, the largest peptide that is being examined is triglycine, the smallest peptide unit that reasonably models binding present in some larger peptides.

From cou.: 7 The most reliable theoretical value in the literature for the Cu+ affinity of glycine was obtained by the CCSD(T) method with a very large basis set.23 Unfortunately, this level of theory is computationally prohibitive for calculations on peptides such as GG and GGG. The procedure used here was to perform structure optimization calculations using hybrid density functional theory at the B3LYP level25–27 using the DZVP basis set28 and to follow these by single-point calculations at MP2(fc)/6–311++G(2df,2p).29–36 The latter level of theory has been shown to reproduce satisfactorily the Cu+ binding energy of glycine as calculated by the CCSD(T) method.23 As an independent check on the geometries and energetics provided by this procedure, we also optimized three conformers of GGG and the three lowest isomers of GGG–Cu+ at B3LYP/6–31++G(d,p).37,38 In every comparison, we found no substantive differences in the structures and relative energies provided by the two different basis sets.

The structural parameters for the lowest energy structure found for this complex, 1Cu, are shown in Fig. 1. Ion 1Cu is dicoordinate, with the two most basic sites of glycine, the terminal amino group and the carbonyl oxygen, interacting with Cu+. This structure is similar to that of 1Ag on the glycine–Ag+ surface, although the metal–ligand distances are shorter in the glycine–Cu+ complex. This is simply a reflection of the smaller ionic radius of Cu+.

From cou.: 16 Structure 2Cu is the lowest energy conformer of the zwitterionic form of the complex; it lies 9.2 kcal mol−1 higher in free energy than 1Cu. This relative free energy difference is more than double the free energy difference of the equivalent glycine–Ag+ structures. This could be explained by considering the fact that, unlike Ag+ in structure 2Ag, Cu+ in structure 2Cu coordinates only with one of the oxygen atoms of the CO2− group. This unsymmetrical coordination of the lowest energy zwitterionic form of the glycine–Cu+ complex was previously reported22,23 and was attributed to the strong local dipoles on the N–H bonds that lead to a global dipole moment pointing towards the opposite oxygen.22 However, it has been pointed out that the analogous M+–CO2− coordination with alkali metal cations (e.g., Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+) all show dicoordination despite similar dipole moment effects.23,44 An alternative explanation is that the unsymmetrical interactions of Cu+ to the CO2− group of the zwitterionic form of glycine provide a way of minimizing the repulsion between the occupied d shell of the metal and the lone pairs of oxygens.23 This argument, however, is also unsatisfactory as Ag+ is isoelectronic with Cu+ and yet prefers symmetrical coordination with the CO2− group of the zwitterionic form of glycine. In both cases, however, the presence of the metal ion strongly stabilizes the zwitterionic form of glycine; on the potential energy hypersurface for glycine the zwitterion is not even at a minimum.45

From cou.: 19 Conformational searches using molecular mechanics techniques were used to investigate rapidly the potential energy surface of neutral GG. The low-lying conformers obtained from this search were then optimized at B3LYP/DZVP, followed by single-point calculations at MP2(fc)/6–311++G(2df,2p) (see Fig. 2 and Table 2). The three lowest energy structures obtained for this surface are shown in Fig. 2. Two of these three structures, 4N and 5N, have folded conformations. Recently, Cerda et al.46 reported structure 4N to be the lowest energy conformer on this surface; however, in their work structure 5N was not considered. As shown in Fig. 2, structure 5N, displaying two internal hydrogen bonds, appears to be the most compact of the three conformers. These three conformers have almost identical free energies, and therefore it is important to clarify that for our discussion of significant structural and relative free energy differences of complexes of Cu+ and Ag+ with polyglycines and also for providing good estimates of the binding energies of these two metal ions, it is not crucial that the global minimum of the neutral peptide be identified.

From cou.: 21 Previously we have shown 47 that the “ external” proton in protonated triglycine is “mobile”. In that study47 we demonstrated that the barriers involved for the “external” proton to migrate from the terminal nitrogen to any of the carbonyl oxygen atoms along the peptide backbone are relatively low. In a subsequent study, we also showed that these barriers are significantly lowered by the addition of a single solvent molecule.48 Based on this knowledge, we did not limit ourselves in this study to structures where the proton is on the terminal amino group. The potential energy surface of the GG–Ag+ complex was rigorously examined. Eleven structures on this surface were optimized and characterized as being at minima. The lowest energy structure, 3Ag, found on this surface is shown in Fig. 2. This structure is very similar to the lowest energy structure of the glycine–Ag+ complex, ion 1Ag, where the silver ion is dicoordinate, attached to the terminal nitrogen and the carbonyl oxygen of the amide. Structure 4Ag, depicts the only tricoordinate silver complex of GG found on this surface; here the silver ion is chelated to the terminal nitrogen and to both of the carbonyl oxygens of GG. Interaction of Ag+ with the three most electron-rich sites of GG might a priori be expected to lead to the lowest energy structure; however, the steric effect of folding the GG backbone to accommodate this mode of coordination makes this structure less favored, but still competitive at a relative free energy of only 1.2 kcal mol−1 higher than the structure at the global minimum. Ion 5Ag, where Ag+ binds to both carbonyl oxygen atoms, is further stabilized by a hydrogen bond in which the lone pair on the terminal amino interacts with an amide hydrogen that has been rendered more acidic by complexation of the oxygen on the same amide linkage with Ag+. This ion is found to be at a low-lying energy minimum, being only 2.5 kcal mol−1 above the global minimum.

From cou.: 23 The zwitterionic forms of the GG–Ag+ complex were also extensively investigated. The three lowest energy conformers of this form of the ion are shown in Fig. 2. The lowest energy structure of all the zwitterions on this surface, structure 7Ag, is only 8 kcal mol−1 above structure 3Ag. This zwitterionic structure is stabilized by two internal hydrogen bonds. One of these bonds is between the terminal amino nitrogen and the acidic amide hydrogen; the second, and significantly stronger interaction, is between the hydroxy hydrogen and the carbonyl oxygen of the CO2− group. The latter interaction is by far the shortest hydrogen bond found on this potential hypersurface. The position of the hydrogen atom between two very electronegative sites, the relatively short distance between that hydrogen and the carbonyl oxygen of the CO2− group (1.399 Å) and the O–H–O angle of 174°, which is nearly the ideal 180°, are all factors that contribute to the strength of this hydrogen bond and hence to the stability of this structure. The other two zwitterionic structures presented here, 8Ag and 9Ag, both involve the localization of some of the positive charge on the terminal nitrogen; this arrangement leads to some charge separation, as the metal center and the terminal NH3+ group account for most of the positive charge in these species.

The presence of the two intramolecular hydrogen bonds in this structure, similar to those in 7Ag, the GG–Ag+ counterpart of this structure, help to stabilize this isomer. However, the preference of Cu+ for monocoordination makes this structure a relatively high energy species, 12.5 kcal mol−1 higher in free energy above 3Cu.

 ###### 
From cou.: 28 Structure 9Cu, the highest energy species of GG–Cu+ considered in this work, is interesting as, unlike in 7Cu and 8Cu, it has the Cu+ dicoordinated with both oxygens of the CO2− group in a nearly symmetrical fashion. This is perhaps due to the absence of strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions with either of these oxygens. Such interactions deplete some of the electron density from the carbonyl oxygen where the hydrogen bonding takes place, thereby rendering that carbonyl oxygen a less attractive binding site for the copper ion. This seems to be a more satisfactory explanation of the unsymmetrical coordination of Cu+ to the CO2− group of the zwitterions encountered here and previously in the literature.22,23 Further evidence is obtained upon careful inspection of structure 9Cu. The weak hydrogen bond between the mildly acidic amide hydrogen and the adjacent carbonyl oxygen of the CO2− group causes some depletion of some of the electron density on that oxygen, thereby rendering it a less attractive site for Cu+ attachment, as reflected in the longer bond distance between that oxygen and the metal center (2.185 Å) relative to the of the metal center and the other carbonyl oxygen of the CO2− group (2.067 Å). This explanation is further corroborated with the symmetrical coordination observed in this work of Cu+ to the carbonyl oxygens of the CO2− group of cuprous formate, a molecule devoid of any hydrogen bonding.
From Soup: 28 Structure 9Cu , the highest energy species of GG–Cu + considered in this work, is interesting as, unlike in 7Cu and 8Cu , it has the Cu + dicoordinated with both oxygens of the CO 2 − group in a nearly symmetrical fashion. This is perhaps due to the absence of strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions with either of these oxygens. Such interactions deplete some of the electron density from the carbonyl oxygen where the hydrogen bonding takes place, thereby rendering that carbonyl oxygen a less attractive binding site for the copper ion. This seems to be a more satisfactory explanation of the unsymmetrical coordination of Cu + to the CO 2 − group of the zwitterions encountered here and previously in the literature. 22,23 Further evidence is obtained upon careful inspection of structure 9Cu .

From cou.: 31 Various conformers of GGG were previously examined by Zhang et al.,49 and also more recently by Strittmatter and Williams50 in their attempts to obtain accurate values for the proton affinity of GGG. While the proton affinities obtained by both groups are comparable and agree well with experimental values,51 the level of theory used in their work is modest by today's standards. The potential energy surface of neutral GGG has been shown to be relatively flat with many structures at low energy minima. We have performed independent conformational searches and optimized many of the lowest energy conformers at B3LYP/DZVP (see Table 3 and Fig. 3. The HF/6–31G(d) results of Zhang et al.49 were taken as starting points in our optimization work. The three lowest energy conformers found were virtually degenerate and hence, in our endeavor to identify the lowest energy isomer of neutral GGG, all three isomers considered here were reoptimized with a basis set including diffuse functions [at B3LYP/6–31++G(d,p)]. This reconfirmed that every one of the three structures is at a minimum, while producing a relative free energy spread of only 0.2 kcal mol−1. Single-point calculations on all three isomers were performed at MP2(fc)6–311++G(2df,2p) using the optimized geometry of B3LYP/DZVP. The results of these calculations indicate that 8N and 9N are virtually degenerate with 9N being favored by only 0.4 kcal mol−1, while 7N is 2.5 kcal mol−1 higher in energy than 9N. This relative order is probably due to the better description of the intramolecular hydrogen bonds found in both 8N and 9N by the inclusion of diffuse and extra polarization functions in the larger basis set used in our Møller–Plesset perturbation (MP2) calculations. While we do not claim to have definitively identified the structure at the global minimum on the neutral GGG surface, we have shown that 8N and 9N are essentially degenerate independent of the level of theory and that it is inconsequential to our study which of these three isomers is used for binding energy determination.

From cou.: 32 Glycylglycylglycine-Ag+.
From Soup: 32 Glycylglycylglycine-Ag + . Much as in the GG–Ag + complexes, the silver(I) ion demonstrates its ability to act as a multicoordinate center in GGG-Ag + . The global minimum found for this surface, structure 10Ag , has a tetracoordinate Ag + having interactions with the terminal amino group as well as each of the three carbonyl oxygens of GGG. In order to allow for this mode of coordination around the central metal center, the backbone of this tripeptide must undergo a significant distortion. The energy cost of this steric requirement is more than compensated by the interactions of Ag + with the four most electron rich sites of GGG. This is evident upon comparison of structure 10Ag with structure 14Ag where the silver ion is chelated only to the terminal nitrogen and the adjacent carbonyl oxygen. While this mode of coordination allows for a less sterically hindered GGG backbone, structure 14Ag is calculated to be 3.2 kcal mol −1 higher in energy than 10Ag ; this highlights the energetic importance of the secondary interactions of the Ag + with the carbonyl groups of the second residue and of the carboxylic acid group. In the dipeptide case, structure 4Ag , which is the analogous structure of 10Ag on the GGG–Ag + surface, was found to be higher in energy than 3Ag , the comparable structure to 10Ag . This is perhaps indicative of the extra stabilization afforded by the fourth silver–ligand bond in 10Ag as well as the relatively higher steric cost associated with folding the shorter GG backbone in order to allow for the geometry needed for a tricoordinate Ag + .

From Soup: 37 The binding energies of Ag + and Cu + to glycine, diglycine and triglycine and to some small molecules that contain the functional groups present in peptides are presented in Table 4 , all corrected for basis set superposition errors (BSSE) by using the counterpoise method. 52,53 At this level of theory the corrections are typically 2–3 kcal mol −1 . The binding energies of all Cu + containing ions considered here are greater than those of their Ag + analogs. The ligand for which the difference in the binding energies in complexes with the two metal ions is smallest is NH 3 , the simplest model of the terminal amino group present in a peptide. The difference of the binding energies in complexes with H 2 CO, the simplest carbonyl-containing molecule, is about 14 kcal mol −1 . The difference of 17 kcal mol −1 for H 2 NCHO is larger still; this is the simplest model that contains both a terminal amino nitrogen and a carbonyl functionality. This divergence increases even when the binding energies to each of glycine, diglycine and triglycine are considered; here the differences are 20.6, 22.4 and 30.2 kcal mol −1 respectively.

The Cu + –glycine complex has been the subject of previous investigations and the most accurate calculated binding energy available is presented in Table 4 . This value of 68.1 kcal mol −1 obtained from CCSD(T) calculations is well reproduced by the less computationally demanding approach adopted here (see Table 4 ).

From Soup: 39 In all the ML + complexes investigated, the highest coordination number observed for Cu + was found to be two. By contrast, Ag + does form tri- and tetracoordinate structures. When Ag + adopts higher coordination, tricoordinate in the case of diglycine and tri- and tetracoordinate in the case of triglycine, these structures in all instances were found to be at low energy minima. Several groups have shown dicoordinate Cu + complexes always to adopt a linear geometry in the gas phase. This could be one of the reasons behind the stability of the two lowest energy structures of the GGG–Cu + complex, where the angle comprising the two coordinating sites and the metal is nearly the ideal 180°.
