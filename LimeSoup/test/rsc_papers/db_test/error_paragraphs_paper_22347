From cou.: 1 In the present paper, we studied the preparation of biomimetic triblock copolymer (ABA) membranes in aqueous solution and their deposition into solid supports. The self-assembly structures of the ABA in aqueous solution was investigated by using optical microscopy, dynamic light scattering, electron microscopy (EM) and SAXS. Spherical and tubular polymersomes were found at the highest concentrations investigated. The mechanism of deposition on solid supports (mica and glass) was elucidated by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The deposition results in the formation of a uniform defect-free membrane at suitable polymer concentrations.

(Bio)inspired materials and devices are attracting increasing interest because of their unique properties, which have paved the way to many significant applications.1–3 One of the bottom-up strategies for creating such structured materials is to utilize spontaneous self-assembly of macromolecules. One promising class of these building molecules is block copolymers, which are macromolecules formed by covalently linking two or more chemically distinct polymeric blocks. Block copolymers have been the subject of extensive research during recent years as a result of their very rich physico-chemical behavior, the vast range of nanostructures they can generate either in solid or liquid state, and the fine control which can be exerted by simply tuning copolymer architecture, composition, block lengths, temperature…4,5

From cou.: 3 Amongst different bioinspired nanostructures and (bio)applications block copolymers have been tested for, special attention has been paid to mimic biological membranes.6 Most of the studies in membrane protein reconstitution have been done using supported or tethered membranes based on lipids because they are able to efficiently mimic the cell membranes present.7 The advantages of using polymers are the outstanding stability of the resulting membrane, which can be additionally improved both by changing the chemical structure of the macromolecule and cross-linking the polymer after membrane formation. In addition, it is also possible to tune the membrane thickness by using polymers to obtain values about two or three times larger than artificial membranes based on lipids. In this regard, it was recently demonstrated that triblock copolymer membranes based on poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and poly(2-methyloxazoline) (PMOXA) blocks can be used to incorporate membrane proteins that maintain their activity after insertion as also occurred in biological lipid-based membranes.8,9 These polymeric membranes accommodate the membrane protein by reducing the hydrophobic thickness to values close to that of lipid membranes, while the rest of the membrane retains the original thickness. This fact can avoid the direct contact between the membrane protein and the substrate by creating an effective reservoir of solvent between the protein and the substrate.

From cou.: 4 One of the drawbacks of the solid supported membranes is that the proximity to the solid support is not usually enough to avoid the direct contact between the membrane proteins and the support, which can result in protein denaturation. This problem can be avoided by separating the artificial membrane from the support using soft polymeric materials. Recently, González-Pérez et al.10 showed that ABA triblock copolymers of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and poly(2-methyloxazoline) PMOXA blocks can be used to prepare free-standing block copolymer membranes that allow the incorporation of functional gramicidin A. In this work, the solution was prepared in decane because of the low solubility of the ABA block copolymer in aqueous solution. In order to avoid undesired solvent effects in the membrane protein structure a more appropriate solvent should be used.

From cou.: 5 In the present work we investigate the mechanism of membrane formation by a triblock copolymer of PDMS and PMOXA, PMOXA7-PDMS60-PMOXA7 (type ABA, where the subscripts denote the block lengths), as well as the structural aspects that maintain the outstanding stability of the formed polymeric membrane in a large area. Since the solubility of the present ABA block copolymer in water is concentration-dependent; at low concentration the polymer solution was found to present a homogenous milky appearance and colloidal stability. This opens additional possibilities to use organic solvent-free membranes as a support for membrane protein incorporation, which might avoid alterations in the membrane protein structure as a consequence of the presence of organic solvents. Thus, prior to membrane formation studies it was necessary to analyze in detail the self-assembled structures formed in aqueous solution by the present block copolymer. Dynamic light scattering (DLS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and optical, confocal and transmission electron microscopies (TEM) have been used to characterize the polymersomes in aqueous solution. We found a coexistence of both spherical and tubular vesicles, the relative population of which depends on the polymer concentration. The formation of block copolymer membranes prepared from aqueous solutions onto two solid supports (mica and glass) and their structural characteristics were determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments have been performed to characterize the ABA membranes on mica and glass. The interaction between polymeric membranes and solid substrates become a key step in the development of new solid supported membranes containing membrane proteins embedded. Previously, we showed a large surface area in an array of 64 apertures can be used in electrophysiological studies and represents an alternative to conventional lipid based black lipid membranes (BLMs) that have lower mechanical stability.10 The promising perspectives and new applications in protein screening and protein function studies depend on the standardization of systems such as the present one for different ion channels and other membrane proteins.

From cou.: 13 Tapping Mode AFM in air was performed on a MultimodeTMSPM (Nanoscope IIIa, Digital Instruments). Samples were deposited on freshly cleaved mica. For imaging a solution, a drop of solution was left to incubate for two minutes and dried by capillarity immediately after. Experiments were run at ambient temperature using a J tube scanner (scan size: 10 × 10 μm, vertical range: 5 μm). Microfabricated crystal silicon probes with a spring constant of 20–80 N/m and a resonant frequency of 281–319 kHz (Veeco MPP-11100) were used as received. Z-scale accuracy was checked once a day by means of a silicon grating (TGZ02 silicon grating, from Ultrasharp Cantilevers and Gratings) ensuring a nominal height deviation less than 2% at the highest scan size. The calibration of the scanner was confirmed by using a standard grid with well known dimensions (see Supporting Information Figure X1). To eliminate imaging artefacts, the scan direction was varied to ensure a true image. Images were obtained from at least five macroscopically separated areas on each sample.

From cou.: 14 The coherent part of the SAXS intensity from an isotropic solution of globular objects, I(q), can be written as:13where k is a normalization constant proportional to the number density of scatterers, P(q) is the form factor, S(q) is the structure factor and q is the scattering vector given by q=4π sinθ/λ. The systems studied in this work correspond to widely separated systems. Therefore S(q)∼1 in eqn (1), so I(q) is proportional to the form factor P(q). For dilute systems, the scattering at low q obeys the Guinier law14where I(0) is the scattering at q = 0. The radius of gyration of the scattering particle, Rg,G, in eqn (2) can be evaluated from a ln[I(q)]vs q2 Guinier plot in the regime qRg,G <1.

From Soup: 23 It was recently reported by Grumelard et al. 9,16 that the ratio between the PMOXA and PDMS blocks determine the morphology the polymer can form in aqueous solution. According to this, our triblock polymer ABA should be able to form tubular vesicles in aqueous solution. At this point, we face two challenges: the investigation of the self-assembled structure formed by the ABA copolymer in both aqueous bulk solution and upon its deposition as a layer or membrane on a solid support from the bulk solution. Both steps are necessary to understand the unexpected nature of block copolymer membrane stability as well as the mechanism of fusion in solid supports resulting in single membranes.

From Soup: 25 The image shows the presence of giant tubular polymersomes. This result is in good agreement with the rule reported by Grumelard et al. , 9,16 as previously commented. Using DLS measurements we determine the aggregate size distribution of a set of samples with concentrations ranging from 2.8 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL in aqueous solution. The particle sizes of the different samples were measured without previous filtration after being stored for 20 days at room temperature. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that from CONTIN analysis of DLS data we found a main population distribution with mean sizes ranging between 100–200 nm and other populations with larger sizes are also present, but their number-weight is rather low. For this reason, in Fig. 2 we only considered the behavior observed for the most populated species.

From Soup: 26 In Fig. 2a we can observe that below 7.5 mg/mL the sample contains a well defined particle size corresponding to approximately 100 nm. Nevertheless, above this concentration the samples show higher polydispersity as a consequence of the existence of different size populations, ranging from 100 to 200 nm. At the highest concentrations investigated (18–20 mg/mL) sizes unexpectedly drop to lower values of ca. 150 nm. Further analysis using the Cumulant method also showed a high degree of polydispersity that can be an additional indication of a second population with higher values out of the scale shown in the figure.

From Soup: 27 On the other hand, the size evolution of aggregates (polymersomes) of the PMOXA-PDMS-PMOXA block copolymer with time is also concentration-dependent. In this regard, for concentrations below 7.5 mg/mL the aggregate sizes increase with time from ca. 100 nm up to ca. 200 nm (see Fig. 2b ). In contrast, for samples at concentration above this value the size decreases to mean sizes similar to those for the former samples. In both cases, we note an increase in polydispersity in such a way that samples are not homogeneous anymore after incubation.

From Soup: 29 For concentrations lower than 5 mg/mL, classical spherical and polyhedral polymer vesicles or polymersomes of sizes ca. 90–150 nm are present, as shown in Fig. 3a–c . In particular, Fig. 3a shows some collapsed vesicles in some areas of the picture. The presence of polyhedral vesicles characterized by facetted faces is an indication of the crystallization of the ABA membranes after drying, as observed in Fig. 3b,c . The presence of a small dark spot in the body of the polyhedral polymersomes might indicate the collapse of an aristae of the polymersome membrane after drying or an excess of staining agent confined in the aqueous pool of the polymer vesicle before drying. It is necessary to note that not all the polymersomes display this dark spot. Differences in polymersome size if compared to DLS data might arise from partial dehydration (mainly the polymer corona) of the vesicles upon drying. As the copolymer concentration increases (7.5 mg/mL), a progressive elongation and fusion of the block copolymers vesicles can be observed (see Fig. 3d ). The elongated structures seem to be formed by the fusion of polymeric vesicles and can be considered as a structural intermediate step from vesicles to tubular structures or nanotubes . This incomplete transition offers a strong support to the fusing process hypothesis to obtain tubular nanostructures , as also observed for other block copolymers and lipidic systems. 17

It is possible that Rg,G is highly polydisperse, in keeping with the results displayed in the TEM (Fig. 3).
From Soup: 32 The distance distribution function of the system p ( r ) for 5 mg/mL copolymer was calculated with the program GNOM, 19 using the SAXS data in Fig. 4a . The resulting p ( r ), displayed in Fig. 4c , corresponds to a particle with a radius of gyration R g , I = 158 Å. The good agreement within R g , I and R g , G . ( Fig. 4b ) supports the consistency of the p ( r ) calculation. The distance distribution function in Fig. 4c is characteristic of a hollow particle with strong positive-to-negative fluctuations within the shell. The thickness of the shell can be estimated from the value of r at which the p ( r ) function passes from the large initial positive-negative oscillation into the adjacent ascending region of smaller oscillations. 20 According to Fig. 4c , the thickness of the shell is ∼ 34 Å, such that the overall particle diameter ( i.e. maximum distance measurable within the scattering particle) corresponds to Dmax = 400 Å. Dmax = 400 Å is considerably smaller that the polymersome sizes (900–1500) Å measured by DLS above for concentrations lower than 5 mg/ml. Indeed, the lower q value of the SAXS curve in Fig. 4a determines the maximum size of the particle which can be described through that SAXS curve. Then, although the SAXS data in Fig. 4a is useful to determine the thickness of the shell, it does not contain information about particle sizes bigger than ∼(2π/q o ) = (2π/0.0066 Å −1 ) = 950 Å. Thus, we hypothesize R g measured by SAXS might correspond to the half width of the tubular aggregates formed in solution (that is, the small axis radius). Fig. 5 shows the LSCM results obtained for the sample studied by SAXS . The results denote the existence of elongated structures. Although it is difficult to determine the full length of these structures, the thickness can be estimated from Fig. 5 , as corresponding to (406 ± 42) Å, in agreement with the R g values measured by SAXS .

From Soup: 34 A large area of collapsed tubular vesicles is shown in Fig. 6a (see also Fig. 6b,c for magnification). The white arrows indicate single tubular vesicles over the whole area. The mean dimensions of the tubular polymersomes can be determined from these images, ranging between 400–700 nm in length and 30 nm in width, in fair agreement with the size increase observed from DLS data (which involves the assumption of considering a spherical particles in the theoretical analysis). Other ABA block copolymers have been used recently to form polymersomes with tubular conformation as the result of the conjunction of vesicles by reducing the medium temperature. 21 However, in our case both tubular and spherical polymersomes coexist at the same temperature.

From Soup: 39 We intend to investigate the deposition and membrane formation of the PMOXA-PDMS-PMOXA copolymer on two solid supports: glass and mica. Both supports are negatively charged while our copolymer is electrically neutral. In order to form a suitable homogeneous membrane in a solid support we performed AFM experiments on the two supports by deposition of a stock copolymer solution of concentration 12.5 mg/mL. A drop deposited in the support was left to dry for two minutes and the excess of water removed by capillarity using filter paper. Finally the samples were imaged using AFM .

From Soup: 41 Fig. 9a shows a high density of fused elongated and spherical polymersomes which are not regularly packed, that is, clusters of vesicles are formed. Thus, the membrane formed displays a noticeable amount of defects as a consequence. In order to measure the mean size of the vesicle, we could image some isolated vesicles with the AFM instruments. Fig. 9b and c indicate the size of a selected vesicle as an example, with diameter of ca. 100 nm. Additional measurements on more vesicles indicate that their mean size from 100 to 200 nm with a noticeable polydispersity, in agreement with the size found in aqueous solution. Additionally experiments using an optical microscope have been performed. Using the same glass support and after a drying process we can show the presence of giant spherical deflated polymersomes as well as large polymer layers as is shown in Fig. 9d . In order to know if the irregular structure of the polymer film onto the glass support was a result of excessive polymer deposition, we also performed analogous experiments but including a final washing step of the polymer -loaded support before drying. After extensive washing, at least a great part of the aggregated material can be removed and, then, either individual tubular and spherical polymersomes can be observed, as well as obtaining a more uniform polymer layer. (See Fig. 10 .)

The membrane on the mica support is homogeneous, and the analysis of the roughness on the top of the membrane and on clean mica gives values of 0.11 and 0.57 nm, respectively (see Figure X3 in Supporting Information). This is an indication of the good quality of the polymer membrane formed. After drying the membrane remains stable in the solid-air interface.

From Soup: 45 The membrane characteristics on the mica support without washing step are in contrast to those observed on a glass substrate, in which vesicle aggregation was observed. This different behaviour can be ascribed, on one hand, to the different effective negative electric charge carried by both kinds of supports. 23,25 which clearly influences the quality of the membrane formed. In particular, on mica the total number of negative lattice sites corresponds to one negative charge per 48 Å 2 or 2.1 × 10 14 charges per cm 2 , so the surface charge density is −0.33 C/m 2 . In aqueous solution the value decreases several orders of magnitude because of the adsorption of cations on mica. This situation evidently affects the mechanism of membrane formation on the solid support because of the aqueous stock solution used for the membrane preparation. Also, the membrane formation is affected by the different strength and nature of the interactions between the copolymer molecules and the solid surfaces. 23,26

From Soup: 47 In the present work we characterize the self-assembled structures of an ABA block copolymer in aqueous solution and also the properties of the polymer films formed from these solutions upon deposition onto two different solid supports. The presence of spherical, polyhedral and tubular polymersomes was observed and found to be dependent upon polymer concentration in solution. Also upon drying, the formation of a uniform polymer membrane was found optimal for a mica support. These results open new possibilities to the incorporation of membrane proteins in solid-supported ABA polymer membranes from aqueous polymer solution, avoiding the disadvantages of using organic compounds, which can disrupt protein structure. The choice of the suitable solid support and ABA configuration is hence an important step to a successful membrane preparation. Further studies in membrane protein incorporation using mica as a support will be performed as a natural next step to investigate this system.
