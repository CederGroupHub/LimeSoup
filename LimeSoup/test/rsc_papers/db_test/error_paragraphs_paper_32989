From cou.: 1 The single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) on silicon substrates are a promising candidate for the next generation of electronic and photoelectronic devices, therefore an easy, convenient, and nondestructive method for characterizing such samples is quite important and strongly needed. In this study, we provide in detail such a method to assign (n,m) indices with considerable accuracy through resonant Raman spectra analysis. We developed an equation of ωRBM = 235.9/dt + 5.5 for SWNTs grown by Ni, Co, and Fe catalysts on SiO2/Si substrates in the dt range of 1.2–2.1 nm. This method was further utilized to make (n,m) assignments and quantification for our SWNTs catalyzed by W6Co7, which is highly enriched with (12,6). The less abundant chiralities in the samples were also assigned and the contents were analyzed using a counting-based method. Moreover, these chirality-specified samples allowed us to collect 1330 RBM data for the single chirality (12,6) and the RBM variation was found to be no larger than ±2.5 cm−1. A step-by-step procedure is also provided as a general guide for (n,m) assignments.

From cou.: 2 Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are direct bandgap semiconductors with a clear interface and very high electron and hole mobilities.1 The excellent electronic properties of SWNTs make them good candidates with broad application prospects in the field of nanoelectronic devices.2,3 In 2013, the first carbon nanotube computer was built.4 Very recently, IBM has announced that commercial nanotube transistors should be ready around 2020.5 In order to obtain high performance SWNT-based devices, the preparation of structurally pure SWNT materials, which have uniform chirality (n,m) and bandgap, has proven to be a critical challenge over the last two decades. Recently, two independent works using either high melting point low symmetry W6Co7 catalysts6 or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon precursors7 provided possible solutions for the chirality controllable growth of SWNTs. For analyzing the (n,m) distribution and improving the chirality selectivity, an easy, convenient, and nondestructive method for characterizing the (n,m) indices of SWNTs on standard silicon substrates for devices is strongly needed.

From cou.: 3 The methods widely utilized for (n,m) characterizations comprise electron diffraction (ED)8,9 and spectroscopic methods,10 including absorption, photoluminescence (PL) and Rayleigh and Raman scattering spectroscopies. However, ED and Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy require suspended samples, and thus are not applicable for SWNTs on substrates. Absorption spectroscopy is widely used for bulk SWNT samples, but normally cannot obtain signals from SWNTs on substrates. Recently, the optical spectrum of SWNTs on a substrate was obtained using a polarization-based technique, in which a relatively long and straight segment of clean SWNT was needed.11 PL applies only for semiconducting (S)-SWNTs and not for metallic (M)-SWNTs, and its application for SWNTs on silicon substrates is largely limited due to the quenching of PL on the substrates as well as the strong fluorescence background of silicon itself. Resonant Raman (RR) spectroscopy, on the other hand, is a nondestructive, convenient, and low equipment cost method that can be readily utilized for the characterization of SWNTs on substrates for both M- and S-SWNTs.

From cou.: 4 In RR spectroscopy, the (n,m) of SWNTs are assigned based on both the electronic transition energies (Eii) provided through the resonance conditions and the tube diameter (dt) obtained from some of the diameter-dependent Raman active modes such as the radial breathing mode (RBM). A relation of ωRBM = A/dt + B was established to describe the diameter dependence of the RBM frequency.12,13 The parameter A is determined by the vibrational force constant and the parameter B is associated with the environmental effects,13 which account for tube bundling, substrate–tube interactions, molecules adsorbed onto the tubes, static pressure difference, etc. The value of B is expected to be zero for suspended SWNTs in vacuum. When a SWNT is affected by the environment, the van der Waals interaction-induced pressure will mix into the harmonic oscillator equation. Consequently, the A value will be affected and the parameter B will become positive. In 2001, values of A = 248 nm cm−1 and B = 0 was reported for SWNTs on SiO2/Si substrates.12 Later, many other ωRBM–dt relations were reported, including relations for vertically aligned SWNT forests on silicon and quartz substrates,13 suspended SWNTs,14,15 and surfactant-dispersed SWNTs.16 Based on these further studies, it was realized that imposing B = 0 for SWNTs on SiO2/Si substrates is not suitable due to the non-negligible SWNT–substrate interactions. Moreover, the Eii values were calculated using nearest neighbor tight binding (TB) theory, which did not consider nanotube curvature effects and the exciton effects, leading to some inaccuracy in Eii and inappropriate assignments for small diameter tubes.13

From cou.: 8 RR spectra of SWNTs were collected with three Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM systems, including an ARAMIS spectrometer for 532, 633, and 785 nm laser excitations, a HR800 spectrometer for 488 nm, and another HR800 for 514 and 830 nm laser excitations. These six wavelengths approximately cover 85% of all the chiralities.6,18 A 100× air objective was used, and the laser spot was about 1 μm in diameter. The laser power was carefully controlled to avoid any heating effect on Raman shifts. An 1800 grooves per mm grating was used, giving a spectral resolution of about 0.7 cm−1. The Raman shifts were calibrated using the peak centered at 520.7 cm−1 arising from the silicon substrate.

From cou.: 9 To ensure the laser spot of 1 μm diameter will cover only one individual SWNT, the samples with low SWNT density were chosen. Typical SEM images of the tested region show an average density of 2–6 SWNTs per 100 μm2 (Fig. 1). Samples grown by Ni, Co, and Fe catalysts show similar density and average length.

From cou.: 11 The Jorio group established systematic equations of Eii as a function of dt, θ, and i, for vertically aligned “super-growth” SWNT forests on SiO2/Si substrates.20–22 Due to the negligible interactions and the well-established equations over a broad range, the Eii values of “super-growth” SWNTs usually serve as standards, from which the Eii values of other SWNT samples can be red shifted.

 ###### 
From cou.: 12 The magnitude of the Eii red shifts depends on the SWNT-environment interactions in the samples. For lattice-oriented SWNTs grown on quartz, which is known to have strong interactions with the SWNTs, a 100 meV redshift in Eii from the “super-growth” standards was estimated.24 For one S-SWNT suspended over trenches on a SiO2/Si substrate, a 55 meV shift in E33 was reported between the supported and suspended parts.25 A more systematic study23 on Eii values for random SWNTs on SiO2/Si substrates obtained the resonant Raman profiles for S-SWNTs in the 2n + m = 38 family and for M-SWNTs in the 2n + m = 27 and 36 families. A comparison between their Eii values and the corresponding “super-growth” standards is illustrated in Fig. 2a, resulting in the redshifts of 65–100 meV for S-SWNTs and 15–80 meV for M-SWNTs. Therefore, we choose an average redshift of 80 meV for S-SWNTs and 60 meV for M-SWNTs from the reported values of “super-growth” standards as our reference Eii to be used for (n,m) assignments. In the so-obtained reference Kataura plot (Fig. 2b), the resonance window of Elaser is estimated to be ±0.1 eV,26 indicated by the colored regions over the corresponding laser lines. The uncertainty in dt is about ±0.01 nm according to both spectral resolution and experimental repeatability, which will be discussed further later.

From cou.: 14 By careful examination of the reference Kataura plot, the region with E33 = 2.20–2.45 eV and dt = 1.20–1.50 nm (Fig. 3a) serves as a good starting point for assignments because only a few semiconducting chiralities are available within this region and all of them are supposed to be in resonance with the 532 nm laser. We denote this particular region as the “sparse region”. Random SWNTs on SiO2/Si substrates all catalyzed by Ni were first examined. The RR spectra (Fig. 3b) of four individual SWNTs with ωRBM in the range of 170–190 cm−1 were obtained with 532 nm laser excitation. These four SWNTs, labeled as SWNT-1 to SWNT-4 from smallest to largest in dt, are valid (n,m) candidates in the “sparse region”. The narrow and non-BWF shape G− band is a known characteristic of S-SWNTs.27

From cou.: 15 Based on all available ωRBM–dt relations reported in the literature,13,20 the largest possible dt range for SWNT-1 with ωRBM at 189.3 cm−1 is 1.20–1.31 nm, the lower and upper limits of which are calculated from ωRBM = 227/dt13 and ωRBM = 248/dt,12 respectively. SWNT-2 with a ωRBM at 179.1 cm−1 is in the dt range of 1.27–1.39 nm, which is about 0.07–0.08 nm larger than that of SWNT-1. Clearly, the only two possible candidate pairs in the “sparse region” are (15,2) & (13,6), and (14,4) & (12,8), for SWNT-1 and SWNT-2, respectively. Although the dt value of (16,0) is very close to that of (15,2) and is about 0.07 nm smaller than that of (13,6), it is excluded because the G band of SWNT-1 does not match a single symmetric Lorentzian band shape expected for zigzag S-SWNTs.14 The dt value of SWNT-3 with ωRBM at 176.1 cm−1 was then calculated to be about 0.02 nm larger than that of SWNT-2, which distinctly excluded the (15,2) & (13,6) pair because no possible chirality is available for SWNT-3 in this case. For the (14,4) & (12,8) pair, (16,3) in the 2n + m = 35 family is a perfect match for SWNT-3. Consequently, SWNT-4 with ωRBM at 170.4 cm−1 and dt about 0.04 nm larger than that of SWNT-3 can be assigned to (11,10). Based on the assignments for the abovementioned four SWNTs in the “sparse region”, a tentative function of ωRBM = 237.9/dt + 4.1 can be derived.
From Soup: 15 Based on all available ω RBM – d t relations reported in the literature, 13,20 the largest possible d t range for SWNT-1 with ω RBM at 189.3 cm −1 is 1.20–1.31 nm, the lower and upper limits of which are calculated from ω RBM = 227/ d t 13 and ω RBM = 248/ d t , 12 respectively. SWNT-2 with a ω RBM at 179.1 cm −1 is in the d t range of 1.27–1.39 nm, which is about 0.07–0.08 nm larger than that of SWNT-1 . Clearly, the only two possible candidate pairs in the “sparse region” are (15,2) & (13,6), and (14,4) & (12,8), for SWNT-1 and SWNT-2 , respectively.

From cou.: 16 Using the tentative ωRBM–dt relation, all the observed ωRBM values for random SWNTs on SiO2/Si substrates catalyzed by Ni can be calculated as dt values and plotted onto the reference Kataura plot with respect to the corresponding Elaser, shown as black dots in Fig. S1a.† As a Kataura plot contains congested chiralities in many regions, which complicates the assignments, even with the calculated dt as well as the resonance conditions many data points may still lead to ambiguous (n,m) assignments. Fortunately, there are some data points that can be confidently assigned to certain chiralities, indicated by arrows or dashed circles in Fig. S1a.† For those chiralities, either only one specific (n,m) is available within the uncertainty region of both dt and Eii, or some supplementary spectroscopic characteristics further support the assignments.

From cou.: 17 For example, three SWNTs (two with identical ωRBM at 125.4 cm−1 and the other with ωRBM at 123.7 cm−1, all excited by a 532 nm laser) are observed within an enlarged region shown in Fig. S1b,† which contains both S- and M-SWNTs. The G band shape of these three SWNTs (Fig. S1c†) can clearly distinguish their S or M nature: SWNT-5 with ωRBM at 123.7 cm−1 shows large BWF shape G− band and is distinctly an M-type, and thus can be assigned to either (25,1) or (19,10) with identical dt; the two SWNTs with identical ωRBM at 125.4 cm−1 show obviously different G band shapes, SWNT-6 with a little G+ and a large BWF shape G− corresponding to an M-SWNT and SWNT-7 with a large G+ component corresponding to an S-SWNT. The assignments can thus be made as (20,8) and (24,2), respectively.

From cou.: 19 RR spectra of random SWNTs catalyzed by Co and Fe were collected in a similar manner, and the corresponding data points are plotted in Fig. S2.† As can be seen, by utilizing the tentative ωRBM–dt relation obtained above, almost all the data points are within the uncertainty region of at least one chirality, except for the two SWNTs (both showing a semiconducting G band shape) excited by a 633 nm laser with dt in the range of 1.4–1.6 nm. No chirality is available within the ±0.1 eV resonance window for these two data points. We believe these two SWNTs can be assigned to the 2n + m = 38 family. The observation of these two SWNTs is slightly out of the ±0.1 eV resonance window, which might arise from a strong electron–phonon coupling for SWNTs with a small chiral angle.28,29

From cou.: 21 The RR spectra of SWNT-8 with 532 nm excitation are shown in Fig. S2b.† The ωRBM is observed at 157.2 cm−1, corresponding to a dt value of ∼1.55 nm.

From cou.: 22 Fig. S2c† plots the RR spectra of SWNT-9 with 633 nm excitation. The ωRBM is observed at 185.3 cm−1, corresponding to a dt value of ∼1.31 nm. In the spectral region of 600–900 cm−1, some weak intermediate frequency mode (IFM) features are clearly observed. The IFM features are reported to be present only in SWNTs with chiral angle θ → 0 due to the linear momentum conservation requirement.33 Therefore, SWNT-9 can be assigned to the metallic chirality (15,3) with θ = 8.9°.

From cou.: 23 For the abovementioned two SWNTs catalyzed by Co or Fe, it is found that the calculated dt values using the tentative ωRBM–dt relation derived from Ni-catalyzed SWNTs match quite nicely with the dt values of the corresponding assigned chiralities, suggesting no significant catalyst-specified effects on the ωRBM–dt relation. Therefore, the data of SWNTs catalyzed by Ni, Co, and Fe can be used indiscriminately for the final fitting.

From cou.: 25 For the final fitting, 28 data points with confident assignments are included, and the resultant best fitting equation is ωRBM = (235.9 ± 1.4)/dt + (5.5 ± 0.9) (Fig. 4), which is only slightly different from the tentative relation derived from four SWNTs in the “sparse region”. The corresponding data of the 28 chiralities included in the fitting are summarized in Table 1. The fit is excellent with an R2 = 0.9991, and the average |Δdt|, which is the absolute value of the difference between the calculated dt from the best fitting function and the actual dt, is only 0.006 nm. Since all measurements were performed in air at room temperature, we believe this relation gives the best fit for random SWNTs on SiO2/Si substrates in air at room temperature, and is suitable for SWNTs catalyzed by various metal catalysts. According to the available data, this relation suits for SWNTs with dt in the range of 1.2–2.1 nm.

Only two chiralities are possible candidates: (12,6) with dt = 1.243 nm and (9,9) with dt = 1.221 nm. (9,9) is excluded because it is an armchair tube, and the G band should give a symmetric Lorentzian shape, whereas the G band of those SWNTs all show obvious BWF feature.6 Therefore, the enriched chirality in the sample is assigned unambiguously to (12,6).

From cou.: 29 Similar assignment procedures were performed for all the other chiralities in the (12,6)-enriched SWNT samples catalyzed by W6Co7. By using the derived ωRBM–dt relation and the excitation laser energy, as well as verifying with the G band features, we obtain the assignments for almost all observed RBMs. Table 2 summarizes various chiralities with contents higher than 0.04% in the sample. An average difference between the calculated dt and the dt of the nanotubes is only 0.007 nm for the 21 chiralities listed in Table 2. The assignments for all chiralities with content higher than 0.1% are shown in Fig. 5b and explained as follows. The three chiralities of (11,8), (14,5), and (17,7) excited by 633 nm laser can be assigned unambiguously. Their RBM frequencies were largely separated and no other chirality was present to interfere the assignments. The tubes assigned to (13,6) and (14,4) are doubly confirmed by the fact that they can be excited by both 514 and 532 nm lasers. The tubes assigned to (11,9) might be ambiguously assigned to the nearby chiralities (13,6) or (12,8). However, it would be expected that these tubes should be excited by both 514 and 532 nm lasers if they were (13,6) or (12,8). The fact that those tubes only appeared under 514 nm but not 532 nm laser excitation verifies the assignment of (11,9). The tubes assigned to (15,5) are not assigned to nearby (11,10) because the difference in diameter would be about 0.020 nm otherwise, which is much larger than the average diameter difference of 0.007 nm for all assigned chiralities. The three chiralities of (19,5), (18,7) and (17,9) excited by the 532 nm laser match nicely with three consecutive chiralities in the 2n + m = 43 family and are thus properly assigned. The only ambiguous assignment for chiralities with content higher than 0.1% are (12,10)/(15,7).
