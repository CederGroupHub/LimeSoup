Organic & Biomolecular Chemistry (OBC) was launched in 2003 as a broad scope journal for core organic chemists and those working at the interfaces with Biology, Medicine and Materials Science. Showcasing research in both established topics such as synthetic, physical organic and supramolecular chemistry and also emerging areas such as chemical biology and nanotechnology, OBC quickly developed into a venue for high impact, exciting research from across the broad scope of organic chemistry.
