From cou.: 3 Obviously, the task of theoretically assembling all possible molecules from a given set of pieces (atoms, functional groups) and then selecting the best molecule suffers from combinatorial explosion. For problems of this kind, non-deterministic global optimization methods have found increasing use in the past decades. Since this particular problem is a discrete one, classical genetic or evolutionary algorithms (GAs, EAs)1 provide an elegant and simple algorithmic choice. In fact, GA-based molecular design has been used in materials science,2,3drug design4–7 and molecular docking8–12 so heavily that it is impossible to give a comprehensive overview here. Comparatively little work has been done on using GA methods for molecular design in other areas of chemistry. As examples for what is possible we mention Huenerbein et al.13 with a DFT-based GA optimization of naphthalene dipole moments by substituent variation, Nagata14 with a GA-based selection of dibenzyl sulfide oligomers optimally covering a gold nanoparticle, and Durrant15 with a complete de-novo design of a transition metal complex catalyzing N2 cleavage, varying both the transition metal and the ligands. In order to further promote the use of GAs in general molecular design, we present here an application to yet another area, namely photochemistry in general (involving calculations of electronically excited states) and molecular switches in particular.

From cou.: 4 Molecular switches are key components in the present quest for molecular machines and smart materials. Since these applications are not the primary focus of this contribution, we refrain from even attempting to provide a literature overview of these broad topics and merely point to existing reviews.16–18 Instead, we would like to emphasize that the traditional approach of optimizing molecules for such purposes, employing sequential calculations started individually by hand, is still in use but cumbersome (as documented e.g. in ref. 19). As an alternative, we present here a fully automated approach, based on our object-oriented, multithreading OGOLEM framework.20

From cou.: 5 One of the successful rules of thumb in chemistry is to view a molecule as a backbone decorated by substituents. This view also extends to molecular properties, with the backbone imagined to provide crude pre-sets that can then be fine-tuned by proper choice of substituents. For the present work on switchable molecules, we also adopt this view, in taking one backbone as given and varying only the substituents in order to tune certain properties to desired values. Obviously, this constitutes only a first step towards a more generalized molecular design strategy in which also backbone variations are included.

From cou.: 6 Our backbone of choice for the present work is azobenzene with an additional ethylenic bridge (brAB) which was found to have superior photophysical properties in recent work.21 For the substituent pattern optimization of this backbone, we will focus on one readily evaluated photophysical property, namely the energies associated with the S0 → S1 vertical excitations. For the best cases of our optimized switch molecules, other properties like quantum yield and mechanistic details of cis ↔transisomerization will also be examined, to make sure that our design optimization has not rendered the resulting molecules dysfunctional in their photo-switching dynamics. In future versions of our automatic molecular design scheme, we plan to also include such tests as additional optimization objectives.

From cou.: 7 Two important practical requirements for excitation energies of molecular switches are (1) that they match readily available laser wavelength, and (2) that the wavelength for cis →transisomerization differs strongly from that for trans → cisisomerization, which maximizes the chances that the pure cis and trans isomers can be achieved in the corresponding photostationary states. We have decided to meet both aims by setting our target vertical excitation energies to 405 nm for the cis and 532 nm for the trans isomer. These values were taken on purpose since they are available in cheap laser pointers, fullfilling the ultimate target of switching@home.

From cou.: 8 One of the major drawbacks of any kind of nonconvex global optimization method is the amount of function evaluations needed to proceed towards the global optimum. In this particular case, a function evaluation corresponds to the evaluation of the vertical excitation energies of both the cis- and the trans-isomer. This obviously requires the use of a parallelized program to make efficient use of modern many-core architectures and of a sufficiently fast yet sufficiently reliable method to calculate the excitation energy for a given molecule. These two points are explained in the following subsections.

From cou.: 9 The package we employ for the GA based optimization of molecular switches is part of our OGOLEM framework. It was first presented for the task of global structure optimization of atomic and molecular clusters.20 For the present purpose, we are reusing some of its core functionality. In all parts of OGOLEM, both parallelization and generality are central program development issues. OGOLEM provides Java-thread based SMP parallelization without serial bottlenecks via our pool algorithm, with all genetic operators being loosely based on the classical ones described in ref. 1.

From cou.: 12 OGOLEM now automatically glues the (initially randomized) sidechains to the backbones. Obviously, for rather simple sterical reasons this may fail, causing the program to return this particular switch with a low fitness. The next step is a local optimization of the molecular geometry; in the context of this work it is a MOPAC based PM3 optimization. Again, this might fail for various reasons, rendering a molecule unusable as a switch. Since this case is obviously better than a sterically hindered molecular design, it results in a better fitness than the above possibility. Another undesired case might be that one or both isomers are unstable and collapse in the local optimization. OGOLEM currently checks this by using a user-specified dihedral angle identifying the isomers. When using other backbones where this may not be a good measure, we will introduce new topological ways of checking for system stability.

This is of course the computationally most expensive step, therefore requiring a fast, yet reliable, method. As laid out in the following subsections, we are employing a semiempirical CI method for this task.

From cou.: 15 Once the initial pool is filled, the standard global optimization cycle is started, targeted at yielding optimal excitation energies. For every global optimization step, two individuals from the pool are mated—one of them chosen fitness-based, the other at random—crossed by means of a Gaussian weighted one-point crossover and mutated with a probability of 5%. OGOLEM checks whether any of the two children is already known by means of a taboo search. Only the fitness of not-yet-known solutions will be returned. Following a strictly Darwinistic ansatz, only the fitter child will be returned. The fitness at this point is defined as

From Soup: 31 The evaluation of vertical excitation energies for the pool individuals marks a key step within the optimization procedure. Unfortunately the calculation of vertical excitation energies appears to be a challenging task, requiring not only a considerable amount of computing power but also the critical judgement of an experienced user, making it a task hard to automatize. Therefore, it should be pointed out again that the proposition of this work is not exact prediction of the ultimate switch but most effective selection of a few promising candidates for postprocessing of whatever kind (theoretical or experimental).

From Soup: 32 The method of choice in this work is a PM3 floating-occupation configuration–interaction technique (FOCI-PM3), which we found to be both computationally feasible and stable (see next section for details). The FOCI technique as put forward by Granucci et al. proved to be a powerful tool for the description of excited states, making use of geometry dependent floating occupation numbers, ensuring orbital degeneracy and correct homolytic dissociation upon photoexcitation. 22 Direct semiclassical dynamics combining FOCI-PM3 23 and Tully's fewest switches surface hopping approach 24 were applied to the fittest switches.

From Soup: 42 To the extent that deviations from this simple sum-of-Gaussians form are due to probing the molecules in many different vibrational excursions around the equilibrium geometry, we believe it is rather safe to assume that the quality of these simulated spectra is similar to that shown in Fig. 2 for all substitution patterns. It should be pointed out that the electronic effects of the different substituent patterns are partially taken into account by recalculating the band centers (Gaussian positions) for every substituent pattern. Therefore, the leading error should be the neglect of the possible distortion of the band widths and shapes due to electronic and vibronic effects of the substituents. These effects can be assumed to be less important for the overall spectra than the band positions (combined with fixed widths).

From Soup: 43 With any semiempirical method, a careful assessment of its possibilities and limits should be done. Benchmarking of course requires a method (or results) reliable enough to count as a reference. If, like in our case, very limited experimental results are available for a certain class of molecules in excited states, one needs to trust either TD-DFT calculations or needs to be willing to spend a considerable amount of computing time on ab initio calculations. Of course, as the later is not feasible for a big test set of molecules, we restricted ourselves to TD-DFT references, keeping in mind the shortcomings of this method. 27

From Soup: 45 As can be seen from Table 2 , all methods fail to predict the experimental excitation energies, the only exception being the reparametrized AM1-CI in the case of the trans -isomer. Looking at the difference between the cis and trans excitation energy, the DFT functionals both provide a very good agreement with experiment. Both semiempirical methods mispredict the difference slightly, albeit in a different manner. While PM3-CI overestimates the energy gap, Persico's AM1 underestimates it. Nevertheless, both semiempirical methods do not fail completely in this case.

From Soup: 46 To keep the benchmarking procedure as close to our actual application as possible, we then generated fifty random structures using OGOLEM , without restrictions in the possible substituents. These structures were then locally optimized both on TD-DFT and PM3-CI level and vertical excitation energies were obtained.

From cou.: 47 Since we chose bridged azobenzene (brAB) as a backbone, we started by calculating the fully hydrogen substituted species with TD-DFT and semiempirical methods, comparing it to experimental values.
From Soup: 47 Inspecting the TD-PBE and TD-BLYP data in Fig. 3a , calculated with the same def2-TZVP basis set, one immediately notices the almost optimal correlation between the results obtained with these two functionals. One should remember, however, that these functionals were developed for ground state calculations. Hence, this probably is a very good correlation between two data sets that are both wrong in a similar way, as already implied by Table 2 above.

Nevertheless, both semiempirical methods do not fail completely in this case.
From Soup: 48 Comparing the TD-BLYP results to the two semiempirical approaches in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3c , one notices a worse correlation between any of the two semiempirical methods and TD-DFT. As already hinted at in the previous paragraph, this is much less dramatic than it may seem since it is by no means clear that deviations from TD-DFT indicate worse results. On top, our approach does not yield only a single solution but a set of solutions, which can then be subjected to higher level calculations and investigations on fundamental patterns. Our most important reason for selecting a semiempirical CI approach, however, is that we would like to demonstrate the principle of applying genetic algorithms to the molecular design of switches, given a reasonable method to calculate excitation energies. Since our trust in the quality of TD-DFT calculations as a reference is limited, the performance level of semiempirical CI methods shown here is acceptable for us.

From cou.: 49 To keep the benchmarking procedure as close to our actual application as possible, we then generated fifty random structures using OGOLEM, without restrictions in the possible substituents. These structures were then locally optimized both on TD-DFT and PM3-CI level and vertical excitation energies were obtained.
From Soup: 49 It should be noted explicitly that a global optimization on the TD-DFT level is multiple times more expensive. A single local optimization plus calculation of excitation energies takes approximately ten minutes with a semiempirical approach, while the same calculation on the TD-DFT level used here (in all cases TD-DFT/def2-TZVP with RI approximation enabled) takes 1.5 days. This performance penalty factor of 200 precludes the design of molecular switches by global optimization methods directly at the TD-DFT level, with a similar level of confidence in the optimality of the results as achieved in our study. Given the choice between a small glimpse into search space with a more reliable method and a much larger exploration of search space with a somewhat less reliable method, our global optimization experience urges us to always opt for the latter.

Hence, this probably is a very good correlation between two data sets that are both wrong in a similar way, as already implied by Table 2 above.
From Soup: 50 The rather limited correlation between the two semiempirical approaches in Fig. 3d can be explained not only with the different approaches—opposite to the popular belief PM3 is more than just a reparametrized AM1—but also with Persico's parameters, tuned to free azobenzene , possibly having difficulties to describe differing electronic structures. These results convinced us to choose PM3-CI as the method to obtain vertical excitation energies at runtime.

From Soup: 52 Two different runs were performed to demonstrate the capabilities of the OGOLEM framework, one with all possible sidechains enabled and one with the nitro and carboxyl groups disabled. The rationale for these restrictions in the second run was chemical reasoning: Nitrated compounds generally react in a rather fragile manner. The presence of both carboxyl and aldehyde groups in one molecule complicates its synthesis, since it requires selective oxidations.

From Soup: 53 After 350 global optimization steps with a poolsize of 50 individuals, the first run produced two possible candidates, both with a fitness less than 0.001 E h away from the optimum, which is sufficiently good, considering the method accuracy.

From Soup: 54 These individuals are depicted in Table 3 and Fig. 4 . Obviously, both structures share some common patterns, namely, both are highly substituted with nitro , aldehyde and carboxyl groups. From a synthetic point of view, this is a potential hurdle, but also we can expect this to be a serious intrusion in the electronic structure of the molecule, making it difficult to obtain meaningful results.

The presence of both carboxyl and aldehyde groups in one molecule complicates its synthesis, since it requires selective oxidations.
From Soup: 55 Since OGOLEM allows for that, the natural next step is to restrict the substituents to less intrusive ones and investigate how optimal of a solution can be found when doing so. We decided to remove the nitro and aldehyde functions from the pool of possibilities. Obviously, one can always argue that other choices might have been more suitable from a synthetic point of view. However, we would like to leave this issue to future collaborations with synthetic working chemists. For the present proof of concept, we consider this to be sufficient.

From Soup: 56 For this restricted setup, 950 global optimization steps were performed on a poolsize of 50 individuals, which translates into a roughly three times longer run than in the unrestricted case. The best fitness was 0.012 E h which obviously is much worse than the 0.001 E h using nitro- and aldehyde-substituents. Tests with aldehyde as a possible sidechain showed that apparently the lack of a nitro-possibility increases the best possible fitness dramatically in the context of our model.
 ###### 
From cou.: 57 These individuals are depicted in Table 3 and Fig. 4. Obviously, both structures share some common patterns, namely, both are highly substituted with nitro, aldehyde and carboxyl groups. From a synthetic point of view, this is a potential hurdle, but also we can expect this to be a serious intrusion in the electronic structure of the molecule, making it difficult to obtain meaningful results.
From Soup: 57 Details of the best two individuals are presented in Table 4 and Fig. 5 . The common pattern here is the high substitution with chloride, a functional group not even existing in the best individuals of the unrestricted run. Also, the chloride groups are in both cases located only on one of the two benzene rings, the other benzene ring being substituted with carboxyl and amino functions.
 ###### 
From cou.: 58 Since OGOLEM allows for that, the natural next step is to restrict the substituents to less intrusive ones and investigate how optimal of a solution can be found when doing so. We decided to remove the nitro and aldehyde functions from the pool of possibilities. Obviously, one can always argue that other choices might have been more suitable from a synthetic point of view. However, we would like to leave this issue to future collaborations with synthetic working chemists. For the present proof of concept, we consider this to be sufficient.
From Soup: 58 The above results show that given a sufficiently broad variety of substituent possibilities, our framework is capable of optimizing the substitution pattern of a switchable molecule to yield an excellent agreement with specified excitation energies. Possible restrictions in the substitution possibilities arising from a synthetic point of view might do harm to the flexibility, causing higher fitness values and less optimal excitation energies. It is therefore crucial in real-world applications to provide the framework with the biggest possible freedom.

The best fitness was 0.012 Eh which obviously is much worse than the 0.001 Eh using nitro- and aldehyde-substituents. Tests with aldehyde as a possible sidechain showed that apparently the lack of a nitro-possibility increases the best possible fitness dramatically in the context of our model.
From Soup: 59 Since our global optimization approach in general does not yield a single solution but a pool of possible and good solutions, a reassessment of the excitation energies with a higher-level method like TD-DFT is possible. We will restrict this discussion to the two fittest individuals of both global optimization runs ( Table 5 ).
 ###### 
From cou.: 60 Details of the best two individuals are presented in Table 4 and Fig. 5. The common pattern here is the high substitution with chloride, a functional group not even existing in the best individuals of the unrestricted run. Also, the chloride groups are in both cases located only on one of the two benzene rings, the other benzene ring being substituted with carboxyl and amino functions.
From Soup: 60 For the fittest switch from the unrestricted run, Fig. 6 shows the UV-spectrum, approximated via vertical excitation energies and transition dipole moments. The target wavelengths of the global optimization (labeled by arrows in Fig. 6 ) are matching nicely, as expected from the single-point calculations. Additional information arises from the overlap of the S 1 -absorption bands which, when minimal, allows for a separate addressing of both isomers in photoswitching experiments. While in the present case the overlap of the absorption bands is small, the opposite holds for the fittest switch of the restricted run shown in Fig. 7 . In this case the S 1 -absorption band of the cis -isomer is hidden completely within a broad S 2 - and S 3 -absorption band of the trans -isomer and becomes non-addressable. Therefore, on the basis of our approximate UV spectrum , the fittest switch of the restricted run can be ruled out as a promising candidate for further investigations.

It is therefore crucial in real-world applications to provide the framework with the biggest possible freedom.
From Soup: 61 In order to further characterize the switch found in the unrestricted global optimization run, we calculated 25 surface hopping trajectories for each isomer. This number of trajectories surely is much too small to reliably address any mechanistic details. In combination with the limitations of the FOCI-PM3 model, all we can hope for here are qualitative indications on whether a reasonably fast and efficient switching process might be possible or not. Addressing these questions reliably and quantitatively, requires extensive further work far beyond the aims of the present contribution that focusses on the molecular design process itself. For the present, qualitative checks of the switching dynamics, we focus on the amount of successful switching processes and the approximate timescale of them. The fractions of reactive trajectories correspond to quantum yields and are listed in Table 6 .

From cou.: 62 Since our global optimization approach in general does not yield a single solution but a pool of possible and good solutions, a reassessment of the excitation energies with a higher-level method like TD-DFT is possible. We will restrict this discussion to the two fittest individuals of both global optimization runs (Table 5).
From Soup: 62 To judge whether a trajectory reached product formation, we checked the change in CNNC dihedral angle of the azo -moiety and the CCCC dihedral angle of the ethylenic bridge. These measures are displayed in Fig. 8 , for a reactive trajectory and for an unreactive one, for both isomerization directions.

The target wavelengths of the global optimization (labeled by arrows in Fig. 6) are matching nicely, as expected from the single-point calculations. Additional information arises from the overlap of the S1-absorption bands which, when minimal, allows for a separate addressing of both isomers in photoswitching experiments.

In this case the S1-absorption band of the cis-isomer is hidden completely within a broad S2- and S3-absorption band of the trans-isomer and becomes non-addressable. Therefore, on the basis of our approximate UV spectrum, the fittest switch of the restricted run can be ruled out as a promising candidate for further investigations.
From Soup: 63 Apart from the distinction between a reactive and an unreactive trajectory, Fig. 8 shows that CNNC product angle is reached rapidly within approx. 100 fs in both cases. Note that the product is reached later in the case of trans → cis -isomerization, where the CNNC-dihedral reaches product formation fast while the CCCC-dihedral does not until approx. 1 ps. This effect also was found in the surface-hopping dynamics of the unsubstituted backbone brAB, 26 where it signals the presence of a local minimum on the ground state PES that has to be surmounted to reach the final product.

From Soup: 64 The population of the S 1 excited state shown in Fig. 9 indicates ultrafast dynamics, with a decay of the excited state population down to 50% in approx. 100 fs in the case of cis – trans isomerization and approx. 60 fs for trans – cis isomerization, respectively.

From cou.: 65 To judge whether a trajectory reached product formation, we checked the change in CNNC dihedral angle of the azo-moiety and the CCCC dihedral angle of the ethylenic bridge. These measures are displayed in Fig. 8, for a reactive trajectory and for an unreactive one, for both isomerization directions.
From Soup: 65 As a result we judge the switch found in the unrestricted global optimization as a very promising candidate for further studies. From the limited amount of 50 trajectories calculated we found indications of efficient switching, namely high quantum yields and an ultrafast reaction on the femtosecond timescale. Another interesting fact not mentioned before is the strongly asymmetric electron distribution of the molecule, which is caused by a push–pull substitution pattern. This asymmetric electron distribution is also visible when comparing the dipole of the optimized switch (7.71 D for cis ) with the dipole of the unsubstituted brAB backbone (0.85 D for cis ). Since it is known that push–pull azobenzene derivatives exhibit good switching properties but a serious lack of product lifetime e.g. ref. 28 , it would be of great interest if this also holds for a push–pull brAB derivative, which to our knowledge has not been studied yet.

From Soup: 66 We have presented a fully automatized scheme to optimize molecular designs towards pre-set targets in the area of photochemistry. As a specific test case, we have applied this scheme to the molecular switch backbone brAB and succeeded in finding substituent patterns that shift the excitation energies for photochemical trans → cis - and cis → trans -switching from their values for the bare backbone to new values that were prescribed completely arbitrarily.

From cou.: 67 The population of the S1 excited state shown in Fig. 9 indicates ultrafast dynamics, with a decay of the excited state population down to 50% in approx. 100 fs in the case of cis–transisomerization and approx. 60 fs for trans–cisisomerization, respectively.
From Soup: 67 For the resulting optimized molecular switch, small sets of surface-hopping trajectories were generated. These provide qualitative indications for ultrafast photodynamics and good quantum yields. Of course, these properties would have to be verified by more extensive dynamics and higher-level calculations. Therefore, we view this as a proof-of-principle study, establishing our molecular design methods in general. Future research will then focus on quantitative examination of the photochemical dynamics of the best molecular switch candidates obtained here.

From Soup: 68 On the global optimization side various new features can and will be added to the program. Among them are a more fine-grained scheme for substitution sites, namely to specify which substituents are possible per site. Also, we will try to make first steps towards a TD-DFT based global optimization of switches, being fully aware of the performance penalty of such approach. Finally, the fitness function should be made more efficient by adding properties such as the quantum yield to the fitness of a given molecule.
