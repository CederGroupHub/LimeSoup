From cou.: 1 Ultrasound-assisted extraction is compared with slurry sampling and microwave-assisted acid digestion for the determination of cadmium, lead and copper in biological samples and cadmium in sediment samples by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). The main advantage of using an ultrasound-assisted extraction in comparison to slurry sampling is a doubling of the tube lifetime for all the chosen analytes, most likely because the sample matrix was not introduced into the atomiser, avoiding the build up of carbonaceous residues or silicates on the graphite platform. Consequently the analytical variable costs were remarkably diminished. In comparison to microwave-assisted digestion, ultrasound-assisted extraction resulted typically in a two-fold better precision and better detection limits. For the extraction, slurries in nitric acid were sonicated for 2–5 min using a titanium probe. Subsequently, the solid phase was separated by centrifugation, and 20 µl of the liquid phase was introduced into a graphite tube previously treated with a W–Rh permanent modifier. For slurry sampling, the slurries were sonicated for 20 s before being delivered to the W–Rh treated platform. Nitric acid concentration, sonication time, sonication power, sample mass and particle size were optimised for each analyte to obtain quantitative recoveries. For cadmium the optimum conditions (sediments and biological materials) were, 0.2–3.0% m/v slurry, 0.5% HNO3, 2 min sonication at 15 W. For copper and lead (biological materials only) the optimum conditions were 0.2–2.0% m/v slurry, 5.0% HNO3, 5 min 35 W. The particle size chosen for all analytes was <30 µm. For biological materials, the extraction recoveries were: Cd, 95–105%; Cu, 90–101%; and Pb, 88–98%. However, only cadmium was quantitatively extracted (based on the certified values of the reference materials) from sediment samples (recoveries 92–95%). For Pb and Cu the maximum recoveries attained were 54% and 60% respectively. Detection limits, based on integrated absorbance for the extracts of a 2.5% m/v biological material were: Cd, 3.0 ng g−1; Cu, 88 ng g−1; and Pb, 55 ng g−1. For 0.5% m/v sediment the cadmium detection limit was 15 ng g−1.

From cou.: 2 In solid sample analysis, sample preparation is often the most time consuming step and involves some potential problems, such as incomplete dissolution, precipitation of insoluble analyte and loss of some elements during the heating. This step is also prone to contamination. Over the last 15 years, microwave-assisted sample dissolution has been employed extensively for shortening the time required for sample dissolution, as well as to avoid analyte losses and contamination.1,2 Although microwave ovens of different designs are widely used in the analytical laboratories throughout the world, some problems which are not commonly described have arisen. From the authors' experience with closed and open microwave digestion systems the main drawbacks are: i, Commercial microwave ovens for analytical tasks are expensive (US$ 15000–40000) although domestic microwave ovens have been successfully employed;2ii, the short lifetime of the digestion vessels operated at high pressures (>60 bar) and temperatures (>260°C); iii, although there are several well established analytical procedures, occasional explosions have been observed; iv, the acid content left after the digestion requires a neutralisation step with pure gaseous NH3 (requiring a special device) or, more frequently, elimination of its contents by heating near to dryness, this last step being commonly performed on a hot plate, when the problems associated with losses and/or contamination of sample are not circumvented, unless this procedure is carefully carried out in a special fume hood. v, the long time required for cooling the digestion vessel after the microwave operation (or requirement of a special cooling system); vi, sample throughput is not very high; vii, corrosion takes place in the interior parts of the microwave oven provoked by the acid vapours that are eventually released during the sample pre-treatment, even though the interior parts are protected with acid resistant materials; and viii, the constant supervision required of the digestion procedure.

Gas stop conditions were used during the atomisation step. Argon mini flow during atomisation (in order to decrease the sensitivity) was avoided, since low analyte recoveries in slurry analysis were observed due to a non-isothermal atomisation conditions caused by the mini flow. 30

From Soup: 27 A comparison of the electrothermal behaviours of Cd, Pb and Cu in 0.5% m/v biological samples, between slurry sampling and 20 µl of extracted solution obtained by ultrasound-assisted extraction, was performed. In all cases, the maximum allowed pyrolysis temperature of the analyte present in the extracted solution was higher (>200 °C) than when the analyte was present in the slurry. Analyte losses occur due to formation of organic complexes in the condensed phase processes before the atomisation. When the analytes are extracted into aqueous solution, the losses in the condensed phase are minimised, leading to a higher pyrolysis temperature.

The absorbance signals were similar for the slurry (peak area, 0.125 s and peak height, 0.216) and the extracted solution (peak area, 0.127 s and peak height 0.217). On the other hand, the background absorbance obtained was quite different for the slurry (peak area, 0.125 s and peak height, 0.772) and the extracted solution (peak area, 0.029 s and peak height, 0.049).

From Soup: 30 In order to optimise the slurry concentration, experiments were performed within the range 0.05–4.0% m/v slurry, using 250 µg W + 200 µg Rh as permanent modifier. For slurries containing less than 0.1% m/v the relative standard deviation of measurements ( n = 10) was as high as 12%. The lower the slurry concentration, the greater was the influence of sample inhomogeneity on the repeatability of the measurements, because a smaller number of particles was introduced into the atomiser.

From Soup: 31 For slurries at concentrations up to 2.5% m/v, there was a linear relationship between integrated absorbance and the amount of sample introduced into the atomiser. Above 2.5% (500 µg sample) systematic errors are expected due to the amount of interferents introduced. 31 Taking into account the mean analyte contents in the samples, it was decided to work with slurries within the 0.2–2.5% m/v range.

From Soup: 33 Preliminary experiments of ultrasound-assisted extraction were carried out with biological materials for Cd, Pb and Cu determinations in different HNO 3 concentrations. Also for comparison, the sample slurries were stored in a refrigerator with occasional agitation. After seven days, 20 µl of the supernatant solution of these slurries were analysed. The following variables were kept constant; particle size <30 µm, sonication time 5 min, sonication power 40 W. For Cd an average extraction recovery of 97.9 ± 0.3% (within 0.2–10.0% HNO 3 range) was obtained with ultrasound-assisted extraction and of 75.4 ± 1.6% without sonication, within the same HNO 3 concentration range. These results show that Cd is not strongly adhered to the biological material particles, and could be easily leached into diluted HNO 3 solution. For Pb, average recoveries of 95.9 ± 0.3% and 53.9 ± 1.0% were obtained for ultrasound extraction and without sonication, respectively, for 4.0–10.0% HNO 3 range. For Cu, average recoveries of 97.8 ± 0.4% and 60.1 ± 1.7% were obtained for ultrasound extraction and without sonication, respectively, for 3.0–10% HNO 3 range.

From Soup: 34 It should be pointed out that some amount of all the analytes was extracted in acidic medium even without the ultrasound. However, for quantitative recoveries, the use of ultrasound is required. In this work, ultrasound baths were not employed in the extraction procedures because they are less powerful than ultrasonic probes, and are not convenient for quantitative metal extraction. In addition, ultrasonic baths do not have power control. Another important characteristic concerning the effect of ultrasound is the formation of hydrogen peroxide, 32 which is a powerful oxidant in acidic medium, allowing the oxidation of organic matter and thus increasing the metal extraction into the aqueous phase.

From Soup: 35 The sonication time and sonication power were also investigated for the chosen analytes in order to achieve quantitative recoveries in 0.4% m/v biological materials. It was observed that a 90 s time at 10 W (particle size <30 µm, 0.5% HNO 3 ) was suitable for quantitative Cd extraction from the biological material. For Pb and Cu the sonication time was 4.5 min at 30 W for both analytes (particle size <30 µm, 5.0% HNO 3 ). The suitable power and time of sonication for quantitative analyte extraction from the sample depends on the kind of analyte interaction with the sample particle and, consequently, on the type of the sample. Therefore, to guarantee a quantitative extraction for different samples, the times and sonication power chosen were: Cd 2 min, 15 W; and Pb and Cu, 5 min, 35 W.

From Soup: 36 Particle size is an important parameter to be optimised in order to attain quantitative recoveries in the ultrasound-assisted extraction procedure. Larger particle sizes (>100 µm) will require a higher sonication power (>50 W) for a longer period (>10 min) to achieve quantitative recoveries, and are unsuitable for analysis of a large number of samples. Different particle size ranges were studied, ϕ > 105 µm, 63 < ϕ < 105 µm, 45 < ϕ < 63 µm, 30 < ϕ < 45 µm and ϕ < 30 µm. The extraction of the chosen analytes was quantitative for a sample particle size of <45 µm and recoveries of about 88% were attained for a particle size of 63<ϕ<105 µm. As only 20 min of sample grinding in the ball mill is required to obtain a particle size of <30 µm, this particle size was employed throughout this work; however, sizes <45 µm would be adequate for the proposed extraction procedure.

From Soup: 37 The effect of slurry concentration on the analyte extraction from coppepod homogenate (MA-A-1) was also explored. It was verified that the optimum concentration ranges for extraction were, 0.2–3.0% m/v for Cd and Pb and 0.2–2.0% m/v for Cu. Although quantitative recoveries in the ultrasound-assisted extraction procedure were achieved for sample concentrations of <0.2% m/v, high imprecision (RSD>7.7%) was observed, which can be attributed to sample unrepresentativeness. The upper limit of the sample concentration for the extraction depends strictly on the analyte content, sonication power and sonication time. In order to extend the maximum sample concentration for Cu determination, the sonication power and sonication time should be increased, which increases the total analysis time and decreases the sample throughput. Additionally, the polyethylene walls of the micro-centrifuge tubes could be damaged with a higher sonication power, leading to sample contamination.

These inconveniences could be solved if the analytes were quantitatively extracted into the aqueous phase without a drastic decomposition of the sample matrix.
