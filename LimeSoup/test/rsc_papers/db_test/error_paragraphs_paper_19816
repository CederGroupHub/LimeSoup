From cou.: 1 The steady-state voltammetry for a one electron reduction, A + e− ⇌ B, is studied at a microdisc electrode in the absence of excess supporting electrolyte. For the first time, the full voltammetric waveshape is numerically simulated. Using a combination of theory and experiment, the voltammetry is investigated as a function of two variables: the concentration of the supporting electrolyte and the electrochemical rate constant. The ‘hemispherical approximation’ (in which a microdisc is assumed to be a hemisphere of the radius) is shown to be valid under weakly supported conditions, for a range of electrochemical rate constants . The simulations were used, in conjunction with the Debye–Hückel theory, to rationalise the experimental steady-state voltammetry of two aqueous redox couples: hexaammineruthenium ([Ru(NH3)6]3+/[Ru(NH3)6]2+) and hexachloroiridate ([IrCl6]2−/[IrCl6]3−) (each with varying levels of KCl supporting electrolyte). This investigation provides evidence for ion pairing between [IrCl6]2−/[IrCl6]3− and K+ from the supporting electrolyte. No observable ion pairing occurs between [Ru(NH3)6]3+/[Ru(NH3)6]2+ and Cl−.

From cou.: 2 Over the past 25 years, two types of experiments have enhanced the applicability and appeal of analytical electrochemistry: voltammetry at microdisc electrodes and voltammetry in the absence of excess supporting electrolyte. The microdisc electrode1–5 has allowed cyclic voltammograms to be obtained with a high current density, a low capacitance and a low ohmic drop. In addition, microdiscs can be fabricated cheaply4 and can easily be reused.6 These unique properties have contributed to several pioneering papers, perhaps most notably to the ultra-fast scan work of Amatore et al.7–9 Voltammetry conducted in the absence of excess supporting electrolyte allows both diffusional and migrational modes to contribute to the overall mass transport properties of the system.10–16 The added complexity can be used, for example, to investigate mechanistic pathways invisible to conventional, ‘diffusion-only’, techniques.17,18

 ###### 
From cou.: 3 Despite both techniques providing useful scientific insight, the use of both simultaneously has been limited by a need for accurate theoretical methods.19–21 In general, chemical systems are most thoroughly investigated by means of a combination of theoretical and experimental techniques. Most theoretical research into diffusional–migrational mass transport is based on a hemispherical electrode. Compared to the two dimensional microdisc, the one dimensional hemisphere is a much easier problem to solve: both analytically and numerically.22 Consequently, the use of hemispherical electrodes in experimental work is also popular.17,23,24 However, such studies are restricted because hemispheres are only easily fabricated using mercury: the electrode must be made and characterised before every experiment in order to maintain a clean surface; mercury is toxic; mercury reacts with many common ions, most notably halides and sulphides; mercury often limits the potential window of the experiment in the oxidative direction; finally, the surface tension of mercury, and its potential dependence, limits the range of radii over which the electrode is truly hemispherical. In order to strike a compromise between theoretical and experimental work, many workers rely on the so-called ‘hemispherical approximation’: the voltammetry obtained at a microdisc, of radius re, is presumed to be identical to that obtained at a hemisphere, of radius . That is to say, equivalence between a disc and a hemisphere occurs when their superficial diameters are equal.25 This approximation provides a useful way in which to quantitatively relate straight-forward experiments, involving microdiscs, to simple theory, based on hemispheres. The relationship is known to be exact for electrochemically reversible reactions, of the type A + e− ⇌ B, at a steady-state where surface concentrations are fixed by the Nernst equation.25–27 Although useful in certain circumstances (i.e. voltammetry at small electrodes and at low scan rates),28,29 this simple approximation cannot necessarily be assumed in general.26 The only work to date was published in the early 1990s, when Verbrugge and Baker et al. simulated potential step chronoamperometry at microdisc electrodes (including both the transient and the steady state regions) in the absence of excess supporting electrolyte using the ADI method19,20 where the steps were to potentials corresponding to transport control leading to limiting currents indicative of the electrode potential. Steady-state voltammetry measuring current as a function of the applied potential has never been simulated at a microdisc electrode, possibly owing to the high computational cost.30

The voltammetry is investigated as a function of two variables: the concentration of the supporting electrolyte and the electrochemical rate constant.

From cou.: 51 Fig. 3 shows convergence plots for three conformal maps: Verbrugge–Baker, Amatore–Fossett and Oleinick–Amatore–Svir. The simulations were run for the system with the lowest rate of convergence: the irreversible, self-supported, redox couple A2+ + e− ⇌ B+. This is expected because electroactive ions of low charge, in the absence of electrolytic support, will maximise the contribution of the migrational component to the overall mass transport of the system. The migrational part is known to exhibit slow convergence characteristics.30 In addition, irreversible electrode kinetics lead to a non-uniform concentration distribution over the electrode surface (see Fig. 4). This necessitates the use of a high density of spacial mesh points in the ξ direction. In each case, Δηtop = 0.05 and Δξbottom = 0.05. The simulations were unchanged when these parameters were decreased by an order of magnitude: indicating that convergence is limited by Δηbottom and Δξtop. This region corresponds to the edge of the electrode. This is known to be the location of a spatial node38,39 and a high mesh density is required. The simulations were compared relative to Δηbottom = 10−5 and Δξtop = 10−4, i.e. an order of magnitude smaller than the values plotted on the convergence plots. Fig. 3 shows the rate of convergence for a complete range of applied potentials, θ, when Δηbottom and Δξtop are varied. This is necessary because the conditions for convergence at the top of the wave, where electrode kinetics are reversible, are likely to be less stringent than those at the region close to the half wave potential. The rate of convergence is shown to be very similar in each case and, as expected, is slowest close to the half wave potential. Similar rates of convergence are expected because, as shown in Fig. 2 the distribution of spacial points are very similar. For the remainder of the paper, the Verbrugge–Baker transform is used in order to be consistent with previous work.19,20

From cou.: 60 As explained in the Theory section, this relation becomes increasingly unreliable as the electrochemical rate constant, K0, decreases.25,27Fig. 10(b) shows the percentage error between the simulation for a microdisc and for a hemisphere using the hemispherical approximation. The maximum error is shown to be 3.81%: close to the error range of most experiments. The hemispherical approximation is therefore quantitatively useful when K0 < 10−3. Since this analysis is conducted for an extreme case, this is also valid for higher support ratios and different charges in the one electron A/B redox couple.

From cou.: 63 Fig. 12 shows experimental cyclic voltammetry for the [Ru(NH3)6]3+/[Ru(NH3)6]2+ system. The value of the diffusion coefficient for [Ru(NH3)6]2+ is obtained by fitting the voltammetric current at a steady-state using the numerical simulation.24 The value of the diffusion coefficient for [Ru(NH3)6]2+ is 8.6 × 10−10 m2 s−1, in good agreement with the literature value.41 The steady-state value becomes smaller with increasing support ratio. In this reduction reaction, negative charge is generated at the electrode surface. Positive ions must therefore migrate towards the surface in order to maintain overall electroneutrality. Since [Ru(NH3)6]3+ is positively charged, any factor that decreases the contribution of this species to the maintenance of electroneutrality (e.g. increasing the support ratio) will decrease the value of the limiting current. The variation in limiting current can be simulated as shown in Fig. 13 and 14. However, since the loss in potential driving force is negligible, the numerical simulations do not account for the observed variation in Ef as a function of the support ratio. The trend in Ef, instead, must be explained using the extended Debye–Hückel theory:46–48
From Soup: 63 Fig. 5 shows the corresponding potential (a) and concentration (b) profiles at the top of the voltammetric wave. This corresponds to reversible electrode kinetics. Consequently, the Nernst equation is obeyed over the electrode surface and the flux is uniform. Again, the loss in the potential driving force is negligible ( θ = −0.288 corresponds to E ≈ −7.39 × 10 −3 V at 298 K), as expected for voltammetry at a steady-state.
