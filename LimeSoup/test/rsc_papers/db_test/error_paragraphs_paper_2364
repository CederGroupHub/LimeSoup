From cou.: 1 Although a lot of methods have been proposed to identify driver genes, how to separate the driver mutations from the passenger mutations is still a challenging problem in cancer genomics. The detection of driver genes with rare mutation and low accuracy is unsolved better. In this study, we present an integrated network-based approach to locate potential driver genes in a cohort of patients. The approach is composed of two steps including a network diffusion step and an aggregated ranking step, which fuses the correlation between the gene mutations and gene expression, the relationship between the mutated genes and the heterogeneous characteristic of the patient mutation. We analyze three cancer datasets including Glioblastoma multiforme, Ovarian cancer and Breast cancer. Our method has not only identified the known driver genes with high-frequency mutations, but also discovered the potential driver genes with a rare mutation. At the same time, validation by literature search and functional enrichment analysis reveal that the predicted genes are obviously related to these three kinds of cancers.

From cou.: 2 In the last few years, the increasing availability of enormous accumulated muti-omics cancer data sets has created an opportunity for a better comprehensive understanding of cancer.1 In cancer genomics, a key problem is to distinguish “driver” mutations that are causally implicated in oncogenesis from passenger mutations. A lot of mathematical models, new computational techniques and tools have been developed to solve this problem.2–4

From cou.: 3 Current approaches for driver prioritization can be catalogued into gene level and module level.5 The gene level approaches are the most basic approaches, which focus on the mutation frequency of genes. Usually, the mutation rate in an individual gene is compared with the background mutation rate based on statistical analysis.6–9 Research shows that low population frequencies appear in the vast majority of mutated genes.3,10,11 This characteristic leads to the failure of approaches based on frequency analysis to screen infrequent, but important driver mutations.

From cou.: 4 In addition, cancer development is usually considered the result of mutations of multiple genes and their interplay rather than an individual gene. The module level approaches have better performance than gene level based approaches, due to their ability to exploit interaction information of the biological network and integrate multiple data types.12–23 DriverNet uses the relationship between genomic events and the consequent changes in gene expression to screen driver genes.12 Xseq further quantifies the impact of somatic mutations on expression profiles by a novel hierarchical Bayes statistical model.13 Some approaches use properties of coverage or exclusivity to identify driver modules or pathways, such as MEMO, Dendrix, MDPFind, MEMCover and Mutex.14–18 PARADIGM-shift successfully identifies cancer related pathways by means of integrating different omics data with pathway information.19 Ping Y etc. identified the driver modules and their affecting dysregulated genes through the integration of multiple omic data.21 In addition, DawnRank and OncolMPACT are proposed to predict patient specific driver genes supporting the sample specific analysis.22,23 These methods achieved good performance in identifying driver genes, but nominating driver genes with the rare mutation and improving prediction accuracy still remains a challenge.

From cou.: 5 In this study, we develop a new method to identify potential driver genes of a specific cohort of patients. Inspired by the rationale that driver aberrations can be measured by the disrupted transcriptional profiles,12,24 we hypothesize that driver genes may be determined by dysregulated events caused by a mutated gene and the network relationship among mutated genes. We firstly construct a relationship network among the mutated genes, the outlying genes and the patients, and then compute the impact score of the gene mutations by applying network diffusion on a bipartite graph. Finally, the potential driver genes are screened by robust aggregated ranking. The genes with a higher robust rank aggregation score are more likely to be drivers. Furthermore, to investigate the performance of identifying driver genes, our method is compared with DriverNet, PageRank algorithm and the network propagation algorithm of NBS (NBS_propagation) under our framework.25 Unlike DriverNet, our method further considers the topological characteristics of the network. At the same time, differing from DawnRank, OncolMPACT and NBS_propagation, our method is parameter free and the identified low-frequency mutated drivers on the top of the list are relatively accurate.

From cou.: 6 We propose an approach to identify driver genes by integrating mutation data, expression data and the gene network. The framework of our method is shown in Fig. 1. First, to characterize the impact of mutations on a patient, we construct a relationship network of outlying genes (|z-score| ≥ 2.0), mutated genes and patients. Then, for a patient, mutated genes are chosen as seeds for resource allocation. After applying a diffusion method on the bipartite graph of outlying genes and mutated genes, diffusion scores of mutated genes are generated, which contain the mutation impact (Fig. 1(b)). This progression is repeated for each patient, and a diffusion score matrix is finally formed. At last, a robust rank aggregation method is applied to screen final driver genes on the diffusion score matrix.

From cou.: 7 In this study, we use the datasets from DriverNet, which include genome data and transcriptome data for three cancer types. For our analysis, we focus on somatic mutations, gene expression data for 140 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) samples,26 307 high-grade serous ovarian cancer (OV) samples27 and 86 triple negative breast cancer (TN) samples,28 most of which are taken from the TCGA portal. All the raw data preprocessing and analysis are preformed the same as described in DriverNet. A binary patient-outlier matrix is generated by gene expression data, in which the element is 1 if the z-score > 2.0 or the z-score < −2.0 for each row of gene expression data, and 0 otherwise. Somatic mutation data is translated to a binary patient-mutation matrix, in which a ‘1’ indicates a gene for which a mutation has occurred in the tumor related to the germ line. Furthermore, we use a influence graph constructed from the computationally predicted pathways based on the protein function (FI) interaction network.29 The protein functional interaction network contains 10956 proteins and 209988 interactions, which extends curated pathways with non-curated sources of information.

From cou.: 8 Driver genes may impact differential expression of their downstream genes in the molecular interaction network and also are related to the patients they are mutated in. To represent the relationship between gene mutations and dyregulated gene expression, an influence graph is built, in which an edge connects node i and node j, if there is a path from gene i and gene j in the protein functional interaction network.12 The influence graph has 7386 genes and 3457328 interactions. Then we integrate mutation data, gene expression data and the influence graph to construct a tripartite network. The nodes of the network include: (1) the set of genes with an outlying status (the left in the tripartite network); (2) the set of genes with a mutation status (the middle in the tripartite network); and (3) the set of patients with a mutation status (the right in the tripartite network). For each patient, we draw edges following two principles. The one is that an edge is drawn between the nodes on the middle and right partitions of the network if gene gi mutated in patient k. The other is that an edge is drawn between the nodes on the left and middle partitions of the network if gene gj presents outlying expression in patient k and gene gj connects gene gi in the influence graph.

From cou.: 9 Recently, the recommender system has been paid more attention. A lot of personalized recommendation technologies are appeared and applied in the economy and society fields.30–32 Diffusion-based algorithms are used in personalized recommendations and they have been shown to be successful for recommending a task.33–37Fig. 2 shows the diffusion strategy. If we give the initial value (1, 0, 1, 0) to the right four nodes, after performing two-step diffusion, the recommended score of the second node owning more common neighbours of the first and third node is higher than that of the fourth node. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that if a mutated gene connects more common outlying genes connected by initial mutated genes, it has more similar mutation ability with initial mutated genes and achieves a higher diffusion score. We formulate the integrated network with outlying genes O = {O1, O2,…, On}, mutated genes M = {M1, M2,…, Mm} and patients P = {P1, P2,…, Pk}. Diffusion progress focuses on the bipartite graph of the mutated genes and outlying expression genes, which can be expressed by an adjacent matrix A. If there is an edge between the mutated gene Mi and outlying gene Oj, we set ai,j = 1, otherwise ai,j = 0.

From cou.: 10 Consider a bipartite graph G(M,O,E), where M is the mutated gene set, O is the outlying expression gene set and E is the set of edges. For mutated genes chosen as the initial nodes for each patient, each node averagely distributes its mutation impact to all neighbouring genes, then each outlying gene redistributes the received impact to all neighbouring mutated genes. This process can be seen as the two-step diffusion:33

From Soup: 39 Once the diffusion score matrix is completed, the order of candidate driver genes for each patient can be obtained by simply ranking each column. However, identifying the robust driver genes is the final goal of our method. It means that we need to combine these candidate driver gene lists to a rank list by considering the heterogeneity of mutated patient samples. We apply a robust rank aggregation method (RRA) 38 (R package RobustRankAggreg)to obtain robust driver genes over all patient samples. RRA based on order statistics is parameter free and even can find the ranking event of the unreliable or irrelevant inputs. Let m be the number of candidate driver genes and n be the number of patients. For each patient, there is a rank vector for candidate driver genes. The rank of a gene is the position in this ordering. Normalized rank means this rank is divided by m . At the same time, each candidate driver gene corresponds a rank vector r = ( r 1 , r 2 ,…, r n ), r i denotes the normalized rank of the gene in the i -th patient. We assume that all normalized rank vectors of the candidate driver genes come from a distribution. For a normalized rank vector r of a candidate driver gene, r (1) , r (2) ,…, r ( n ) is a reordering of r . The final score for a rank vector r as the minimum of P -value is defined as following: 38 where β k , n ( r ) is the probability that ( k ) ≤ r ( k ) . Then ordering all rank vectors according to their ρ scores after the corrected step, we can obtain the ranking of a gene which is statistically significant. It notes that initial mutated genes for each patient will achieve a higher diffusion score, but our goal is to prioritize robust driver genes from each patient, so initial mutated genes are treated as priori knowledge in the ranking procedure and their diffusion scores are changed to the minimal value of the score list for each patient before performing robust aggregation ranking.

From Soup: 49 To investigate the capability of our method in detecting driver genes, our method is compared with DriverNet, PageRank and NBS_propagation on three cancer data sets. We adopt default parameters (damping = 0.85) to run PageRank (R package igraph). Further, we compare to the competitive algorithm NBS, the network propagation process of which is embedded into the diffusion step of our framework. We select the optimal parameter α = 0.7 to run NBS_propagation at the same condition using Matlab package nbs_release_v0.2. The result shows that our method achieves relatively favorable performance in all data sets. Our result is very similar with NBS_propagation, but outperforms DriverNet and PageRank. We can not only identify novel driver genes with high-frequency mutation, but also the potential rare and personalized driver genes which could not be found by other researchers. Furthermore, to demonstrate biological significance, we analyze the predicted driver genes by functional enrichment analysis and literature mining.

The precision of the top 58 genes from our method is higher than 60%, later, our result still remarkably overperforms DriverNet and PageRank. In Fig. 3(d) and (g), Recall and F1 score curves of our method are both higher than that of DriverNet and PageRank, but slightly worse than NBS_propagation.

From Soup: 58 Genetic alterations are associated with cancer progression, applying information of genetic alterations could help identify driver genes of tumorigenesis. Indeed, some well-studied drivers for GBM have been ranked in the top list by our method, including PIK3CA, TP53, EGFR, NF1, RB1, PTEN, ERBB2, MDM2 and CDKN2A. Although they are also identified by DriverNet, their rank positions are more near the top in our method. Furthermore, the co-citation of these genes with key terms implicates the strong association with GBM. Fig. 4(a) shows that 76 out of 200 genes are in NCG4.0 ( p -value 3.94 × 10 −23 ), 54 genes are in CGC ( p -value 2.86 × 10 −36 ) for the top 200, and 35 of 58 genes and 29 of 58 genes for predicted genes are in NCG4.0 and CGC, respectively. The details of the top 58 predicted gene comparison are shown in Table 1 . It can be seen that the top 11 genes are known driver genes in CGC, and almost all of them are the GBM driver genes. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are known regulators of cellular growth and proliferation. Somatic mutations in many human cancers are discovered in the PI3K subunit p110-Alpha (PIK3CA). 44,45 PIK3CA with 7.6% (9/118) mutation frequency owns the highest rank in our method and the eighth rank in the rank list of DriverNet. The well-known suppressor TP53 is ranked second with 32.2% (38/118) mutation frequency, which can disrupt cell cycle arrest and the apoptosis pathway in human cancer. ERBB2 is the seventh-ranked driver which is the elite gene related to Glioblastoma. The gene with the highest mutation frequency of 42.4% (50/118) is EGFR, which is ranked eighth in our method and second in DriverNet. New insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1, TP53, PDGFRA, IDH1, EGFR, and NF1 have been provided by the analysis. 46,47 In addition, some known driver genes ranked in our top gene list cannot be identified by DriverNet, such as DDIT3, KIT, PDGFRB, KDR, FGFR2, CDK6 and SMAD4. Our method also identifies driver genes with low-frequency mutations in which the number of patient mutated samples is less than 5, including AKT3 (2/118), EP300 (3/118) and KRAS (2/118). Furthermore, MAPK9, PRKDC, IFNB1, CTDSP2 and PIK3CG are reported associated with GBM and can be seen as the potential driver genes, which can be further validated by biological experiments. 48–51

From Soup: 66 For ovarian cancer, we identify several consistently high-ranking known cancer driver genes, including PAK, AKT2, ATM, CCNE1, PTEM, CREBBP, MYC, RB1, KRAS, EP300, PRKCG, NF1 and so on. Some of them are frequently mutated and significantly involved in ovarian cancer related functions and pathways. Of these 200 genes, 92 are identified in NCG4.0 ( p -value 1.55 × 10 −35 ), 48 are in CGC ( p -value 9.21 × 10 −30 ). Of the predicted 55 genes, 22 appear in the CGC and 11 genes are remaining in NCG4.0. The comparison of the top genes is shown in Table 2 . The first ranked in our method is PAK1 with 1.9% (6/318) mutation frequency which is ranked sixteenth in the rank list of DriverNet, but the count of co-citations with the term “driver” is not very high. PAK1 is suggested as a critical oncogene target in ovarian carcinoma. 53 The gene ATM with 1.3% (4/318) mutation frequency is ranked fourth in our method, but not in DriverNet, and the count of co-citation OV is 31. In this result, BCL2, MITF, APC, AR, BRAF, and MAP3K5 show the same situation with ATM, which further demonstrates the ability of our method. In addition, our method not only identifies known driver genes with high-frequency mutation, such as NF1 (26/318), RB1 (20/318) and KRAS (12/318), but also identifies known driver genes with low-frequency mutations, including CTNNB1 (2/318), BCL2 (2/318), PIK3CA (2/318). In this data set, most of the potential driver genes are with a low-frequency mutation. More interesting, some top genes not in NCG4.0 are the most promising, such as RHOA, PRKDC, IFNG, PTK2, MAP3K1, STAT5B, PXN, LAMA3, and PLCB1. RHOA is the second-ranked gene in our method, and it is altered in 2/318 of OV patient samples, the count of co-citation terms “driver”, “cancer” and “ovarian cancer” is 4, 259 and 10 respectively. It reports that up-regulation of RHOA is associated with tumor progression in ovarian carcinoma. 54 PRKDC encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which is a member of the PI3/PI4-kinase family. It is identified as a novel serum protein biomarker for ovarian cancer. 55 IFNG is an important regulator of the immune response to tumors and has widely been used to treat solid tumors. 56,57 PTK2, also known as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), plays a role in the signal transduction of a number of pathways, such as cell migration and cellular proliferation, and it has been implicated in many types of cancer including breast and ovarian. 58–60 It also has been linked to cell cycle progression in ovarian cancer. 61

From Soup: 74 For breast cancer, some the well-studied drivers in our top ranked gene list are found. Then, we did a comparison with DriverNet on the top 13 genes which is shown in Table 3 . We can see that out of the 8 genes identified in NCG4.0, 6 are known driver genes in CGC. PTEN with 11.3% (8/71) mutation frequency has the highest rank in our method and is sixth ranked in the rank list of DriverNet. The well-known suppressor TP53 is ranked sixth with 49.3% (35/71) mutation frequency in our method. In this data set, an interested phenomenon shows that the top 6 genes are the same in both results with just a different rank position. We identify two potential driver genes ranked in our top 13 gene list which cannot be identified by DriverNet, such as TRAF6 and LRP6. Our method also identifies the known driver gene NRAS which is mutated in 2 samples and PIK3CA which is mutated in 7 samples. The activation of NRAS by amplification may promote breast cancer progression. 62 PIK3CA is reported as the most mutated oncogene in human breast cancer and plays an important role in epithelial carcinogenesis. 63 CASP3, NR3C1 and LRP6 show a significant count of co-citations with the term “cancer” and “breast cancer”. This is particularly the case for CASP3, which shows counts of 6, 1060 and 120 for co-citation with terms “driver”, “cancer” and “breast cancer”, respectively. Indeed, CASP3 plays a crucial role during apoptosis, its mutation is observed in breast cancer and even other human cancers. 64,65 NR3C1 usually initiates anti-apoptotic pathways in Estrogen receptor negative breast cancer cells; it is associated with poor prognosis in Estrogen receptor negative breast cancers. 66 Wnt signaling co-receptor LRP6 silencing in breast cancer cells reduces Wnt signaling, cell proliferation, and in vivo tumor growth and it becomes a potential therapeutic target. 67 So, these predicted driver genes can be seen as potential driver genes, which will be further validation by biological experiments.

From Soup: 78 In recent years, a lot of methods and computational tools have been developed to pinpoint driver genes, however, they also have some limitations in the detection of driver genes with low frequency mutation. In this work, we try to take this challenge to identify specific and rare driver genes from tumor samples. We develop a simple method that incorporates somatic mutation data and gene expression data into a gene–gene relation network to nominate cancer driver genes. Our method obviously outperforms DriverNet and PageRank although the performance of NBS_propagation is slightly higher than that of our method. Our method is simple and parameter free. At the same time, the results demonstrate that our method shows its ability to identify cancer driver genes, even low-frequency driver genes. Three potential reasons may ensure the favorable performance in our method. First, cancer formation and progression is reported to be correlated with cooperative dysregulation of gene sequence and expression. The constructed integrated network of our method depicts the relationship of somatic mutatione and dysregulated gene expression to some extent. Second, two-step diffusion further amplifies the mutation impact of the initial mutated genes to other genes by the network topological structure. Finally, different patients have differential mutated status. The robust aggregating rank strategy sufficiently considers the heterogeneity of patients. On the other hand, the bipartite graph is constructed from the protein functional interaction network (FI). It represents the relationship between mutated genes and the downstream genes impacted by them in FI. If a mutated gene impacts the more outlying genes, the more likely it may be the driver. It is one of the rationales of our method to identify drivers. So the top-ranked genes prefer the mutated genes with a high degree in the bipartite graph. Fig. 9 shows this characteristic of our method.

From Soup: 79 For three cancer data sets (GBM, OV, breast cancer), we predict 58, 55 and 13 potential driver genes, respectively. Most of them are the known driver genes, the rest of them are further validated for their association with cancer by functional analysis and co-citation analysis. Fig. 4(b) shows the commonalities in the predicted driver genes. We identify three common genes (PIK3CA, RB1, PTEN), more interesting is that they are all the known driver genes. In conclusion, our method can be used as a complementary approach to find rare driver mutation genes and the predicted genes can be seen as potential drivers of specific cancers.

Fig. 4(b) shows the commonalities in the predicted driver genes. We identify three common genes (PIK3CA, RB1, PTEN), more interesting is that they are all the known driver genes. In conclusion, our method can be used as a complementary approach to find rare driver mutation genes and the predicted genes can be seen as potential drivers of specific cancers.
