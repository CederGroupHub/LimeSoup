From cou.: 1 The water and oil distribution in tobacco has a significant impact on its industrial manufacturing. However, the proton distribution in tobacco remains largely unknown. In the present study, the proton distribution in tobacco was measured before and after dehydration. Both the longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times were measured. To distinguish among different water fractions with overlapping signals in the single T1 and T2 spectrograms, the T1–T2 correlation spectrum was examined. Two water fractions and one oil fraction were firstly proven to exist in tobacco. The migration of water in tobacco, which plays an important role in the efficiency of tobacco processing, was also quantitatively analyzed by spin-echo single point imaging (SE-SPI). The water content in the different layers was determined by the signal intensity of the corresponding layers, and the interlayer and intralayer water migration mechanisms were firstly reported and the corresponding rate was calculated. TD-NMR proved to be an effective method to study tobacco systems.

From cou.: 2 Tobacco is a complex and heterogeneous material comprising a large variety of biopolymers.1 The water in tobacco interacts with and penetrates into the tobacco matrix. Moistening is an exceedingly important process employed throughout the tobacco industry.2–4 The purpose of moistening is to prevent the loss of tobacco material from shattering when tobacco leaves are cut due to their brittleness at low water content.5,6 In moistening, water migration and equilibrium are mainly induced by capillary action. When designing the moistening process, the distribution and migration rate of water is a critical factor. One useful technique is to express the migration rate by the effective migration coefficient of water in tobacco. Moreover, when considering engineering applications for the actual process, it is essential that the calculations can be performed in an easy and quick manner.

From cou.: 3 Time-domain NMR (TD-NMR) has proven to be a versatile and non-invasive tool for determining oil and water content, pore size distribution in porous materials and phase changes associated with, for example, changing solid–liquid ratios, rehydration process, solid fermentation and glass transition processes.7–10 In an NMR relaxometry experiment, the process in which the excited spins return from their high energy level back to their original state is defined as relaxation. NMR relaxation is analyzed in terms of two separate processes, each with their own time constants used to describe the rate of the process. The recovery of the spin in the direction of the external magnetic field is defined as longitudinal relaxation, the speed of which can be evaluated by the T1 relaxation time (T1). The other process is transverse relaxation, which is related to the phase randomization of spins in the direction perpendicular to the external magnetic field, the speed of which can be evaluated by the T2 relaxation time (T2). In general, the relaxation time of protons is highly related to their molecular rotational correlation time. The rotational correlation time is the average time it takes for a molecule to rotate one radian and is the molecular dynamics parameter employed in the measurement of viscosity at the molecular level. Thus, TD-NMR can be applied as a powerful tool to study proton mobility and dynamics in various polymers. However, the signals of different proton fractions sometimes overlap in the one-dimensional T1 and T2 spectrograms, making it difficult to identify and assign proton pools. However, two-dimensional (2D) relaxation experiments offer an enhancement to basic 1D experiments.11 The basis of a 2D experiment is that the relaxation time is measured twice in quick succession. In the T1–T2 correlation experiment, the T1 relaxation is first encoded for a period t1, and then the magnetic vector is turned to the horizontal plane (XOY plane), followed by a series of π impulses. Thus, the latter T2 relaxation is modulated by the T1 relaxation. The original data are processed by 2D inverse Laplace transforms, and the results are presented as 2D correlation maps of T1versus T2.12

From cou.: 4 In addition to providing the proton distribution, NMR relaxometry is also a non-destructive profile-selection method suitable for analyzing continuous processes, such as the water equilibrium in non-magnetic materials.13,14 Traditionally, NMR layer selection is employed with frequency encode (readout) gradients. However, the frequency encoding can be distorted by the susceptibility contrast and may be inappropriate for material with a short T2 relaxation time because of the gradient duration. Petrov et al. developed a profile selection method using phase encoding. Phase encoding is insensitive to the susceptibility contrast, as it relies on a regular increment of the gradient's strength rather than on the gradient's uniformity.15 This process creates T2 distribution mapping profiles.

From cou.: 5 Obviously, the water and oil distribution in tobacco has a significant impact on its industrial manufacturing. However, knowledge about water and oil in tobacco is imprecise and is confined within rough concepts such as ‘bound water’ and ‘free water’. The migration and equilibrium of water in tobacco play an important role in the efficiency of tobacco processing. It is well known that water migration in tobacco is mainly determined by the capillarity action and water gradient between adjacent layers. In the present study, a non-destructive, multifaceted NMR method was applied to continuously monitor water migration on the millimeter-scale. The water contents of the different layers were expressed by the signal intensity of the corresponding layers, and the migration rate between the adjacent layers was also calculated.

From cou.: 6 The original tobacco sample (11% water content), deionized water were provided by Hebei Tobacco Corporation. Fresh flue cured tobacco was harvested from Yunnan Province, China in 2013. After harvest, tobacco was dried, then threshed and redried. In order to obtain good sensory attribute, the dried tobacco had been stored in warehouse for natural fermentation (natural aging) for 3 years. Approximately 1.5 g of the original tobacco sample was measured by NMR, dried in a XMA-600 hot air drier (Yetuo Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) to constant weight (relative error less than 1‰) at 105 °C, and then measured by NMR again. The T2 and T1 relaxation times and corresponding population were recorded. In the profile selection experiment, the tobacco was loaded as shown in Fig. 1. Water was injected into the bottom of the NMR tube to form a 1.5 mm water layer (0.12 g). Tobacco was placed in tube, where the bottom layer of the tobacco touched the water layer.

From cou.: 7 The NMR relaxometry experiments were performed in a 22.4 MHz bench top NMR with a phase-encoding gradient unit (Niumag Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). The T2 relaxation time was measured using the Carr–Purcell–Meiboom Gill (CPMG) sequence.16 The interval time (TE) between successive 180° pulses was 500 μs. To increase the signal to noise ratio, data from 2000 echoes were acquired over 32 scan repetitions. The repetition time between two successive scans (TR) was 2 s to ensure the thermal restoration of equilibrium magnetization. The T1 relaxation times were determined using an inversion-recovery sequence. Twenty data points were acquired by incrementing (exponential series) the 180–90° pulse spacing from 0.5 to 5000 ms. Each acquisition was repeated 8 times. The relaxometry measurements were conducted at 25 °C. The T1 and T2 decay curves were processed by MultiExp Inv Analysis software (Niumag Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China), which uses a modified algorithm of the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT).17 This algorithm ensures the relaxation time distribution when the signal to noise ratio of the measured sample is very low. Besides, SIRT is a user-friendly algorithm with less artificial errors as users do not need to set or adjust many parameters. In addition, SIRT can achieve the global optimal control with fast iteration convergence. In this experiment, the number of iteration is 106 to minimize fitting error. Plots of the relaxation amplitude (arbitrary units) versus the relaxation time were obtained. The relaxation time T2i (T2) and T1j (T1) and corresponding proton population (signal area ratio) were recorded.

From cou.: 9 The layer selection experiment was performed using a spin-echo single point imaging (SE-SPI) sequence. The field of view (FOV) was 31.5 mm. The FOV area was divided into 21 layers, and each layer was 1.5 mm. Phase encoding was applied after the first 90° impulse of CPMG, and the other parameters of CPMG were the same as in the T2 relaxation measurement. The original data were filled in K-space, and then processed by fast Fourier transform to obtain the decay curves of different tobacco layers. The decay curves were inversed by SIRT to obtain T2 relaxation curves. The signal intensity (first point on the decay curves) and T21 fraction population of different tobacco layers at 0, 10, 20, 30 and 60 min were recorded. Each test was repeated 3 times. The moisture migration lasts longer than 60 min in the present study; however, we only recorded data for the first hour because the migration became very slow after 60 min.

From cou.: 11 There are three major types of materials in tobacco that contain protons: water, oil and cellulose. Cellulose was not included in the present study because its protons are in the solid state and belong to the Gaussian component, which is difficult to excite and detect. The water and oil in tobacco are important to its industrial processing. Water has a significant impact on the physical properties, storage and burning velocity. In addition, the oil in tobacco is related to its sensory attributes. The interpretation and origin of multi-relaxation in heterogeneous systems have been studied extensively. In general, the multi-exponential relaxation behavior of various materials can be ascribed to different water fractions that exist in the heterogeneous microstructures and protons of the biopolymers.18,19 As shown in Fig. 2, there are three fractions in the original tobacco (moisture content 11%). The T21 fraction relaxed the quickest, with a relaxation time of approximately 0.3 ms, and accounted for approximately 87% of the total signal. This fraction may include the water in different substructures of the tobacco. The T22 and T23 fractions, which accounted for 13% of the total signal, presented typical characteristics of plant oil; thus, these two fractions can be reasonably assigned to tobacco oil. The assignments will be confirmed in the following drying experiment. However, there were only two proton fractions, T11 and T12, present in the T1 spectrum, which is less than the number of fractions in the T2 relaxation spectrum, as shown in Fig. 3. The T1 relaxation is more sensitive to molecular diffusion and chemical exchange than T2, which is represented by the lower number of T1 components compared with the T2 components.20 As a consequence, the major fraction of T12 was reasonably assumed to be a mixture of different proton pools.

 ###### 
From cou.: 12 To justify the assignments, further experiments were conducted. After drying, most of the T21 fraction disappeared in the T2 spectrum, while the T22 and T23 fractions were almost unchanged, as shown in Fig. 2. After the drying process, the water signal in tobacco disappeared as the water evaporated; thus, the T21 fraction was assigned to water in tobacco.13,21 Bulk water has a relaxation time of approximately 2500 ms;22 thus, considering the short T21 relaxation time, T21 water should exist in the microstructures of tobacco such as fiber water vessels and other compact tissues, and strongly interact with tobacco biopolymers. The T21 water molecules diffused to the surface of tobacco, and their relaxation was enhanced by proton exchange with the labile protons of biopolymers with very short relaxation times.23 The T22 and T23 fractions remained almost unchanged after drying, which corroborates the assignment of oil. Oil molecules are free from chemical exchange and their diffusion speed is low compared with water.24 Therefore, oil is relatively inert in the drying process and could remain unchanged. The T11 fraction in the T1 relaxation spectrum disappeared, which indicates that the T11 fraction belongs to water, which evaporates during drying (Fig. 3). It is worth noting that the peak intensity of the T12 fraction decreased after drying, but part of the signal remained. Therefore, the T12 fraction is reasonably assumed to be constituted by both water and oil. The T1 relaxation spectrum suggested that there were two water fractions with different T1 relaxation times in tobacco. However, there was one water fraction in the T2 relaxation spectrum of tobacco, implying that the two water fractions shared similar T2 relaxation times that overlapped in the T2 relaxation spectrum. In addition, one of the water fractions and an oil fraction also overlapped in the T1 spectrum. Ideally, the distribution of water relaxation times should be equivalent to the number of proton fractions. However, the diffusion of water between neighboring compartments averages their NMR signals to an extent that depends on the magnitude of the water self-diffusion coefficient, the compartment morphology and the difference in intrinsic relaxation rates.25 In addition, different proton fractions, such as water and oil in the present study, may exhibit similar T1 or T2 relaxation times on the one-dimensional scale. To justify the hypothesis, a T1–T2 correlation experiment was conducted and is shown in Fig. 4. There are three major proton fractions in the T1–T2 correlation plot. Two fractions are located along the same horizontal axis of the T2 relaxation but can be differentiated by their T1 relaxation along the vertical axis, according to the T2 relaxation spectrum. This demonstrated that there were two water fractions with similar T2 relaxations but different T1 relaxations in tobacco. Similarly, the T12 fraction in the T1 relaxation contained two fractions with similar T1 relaxation times but different T2 relaxation times, demonstrating that one water fraction and an oil fraction have similar T1 relaxation times.

From cou.: 13 In short, there were two water fractions and one oil fraction in the original tobacco. Water fractions evaporated during drying, while the oil fraction was retained. The two water fractions could not be distinguished by their T2 relaxations. One of the water fractions and an oil fraction overlapped in the T1 relaxation spectrum. All fractions were clearly displayed in the T1–T2 correlation plot.

From cou.: 14 Previous studies have offered several solutions for the calculation of water migration in tobacco. However, these methods were all based on mathematical models due to the lack of an appropriate layer moisture analysis method.5 In addition, the differences between the predications of mathematical models and actual results should also be considered as potential drawbacks. NMR provides several non-invasive layer-selection methods. Compared with the readout gradient method, whose uniformity can be distorted by the materials, phase encoding (or constant-time imaging) techniques used in SE-SPI can overcome this shortcoming, as phase encoding relies on a regular increment in the gradient's strength rather than on the gradients uniformity. In addition, the phase encoding approach provides, in principle, the same range of measurable T2 relaxations as a regular CPMG experiment.

From cou.: 15 Because the NMR signal intensity is proportional to the moisture and oil content in foodstuff, NMR methods have been widely applied to analyze the water and oil content in grain, meat and milk.26,27 In the present study, we used the signal intensity of certain layers to determine its water content. Fig. 5 shows the signal intensity of different tobacco layers after 10 min. The columns from left to right signify the different tobacco layers from bottom to top. The bottom layer (black, 0–1.5 mm) absorbed water from the water layer and transported the water to the upper layers because of capillary action. The bottom layer had the highest signal, as it was adjacent to the water layer and had the highest water absorption efficiency. The signal intensity gradually decreased from the bottom up, indicating that the water gradient was caused by interlayer water migration. As shown in Fig. 6, after 60 min, the signals of all of the layers increased, indicating that water had migrated to the upper layers. The signal intensity of the 8th layer (not shown) did not increase significantly during experiment; thus, the 7th layer (yellow) was defined as the boundary in this experiment. The 7th layer only absorbed a limited amount of water from the 6th layer, and its water transport to the next layer (8th) could be neglected. The T2 relaxation profile is shown in Fig. 7 (10 min) and Fig. 8 (60 min). Due to the water migration, the T2 relaxation of tobacco changed significantly compared with the original sample. In the spectrum of the 7th layer, for example, after 10 min of migration, the T22 and T23 fractions in tobacco merged, and the signal was larger than the original T21 water fraction in tobacco. It seemed that the initial water migration was fast because water reached the 7th level and significantly altered the T2 relaxation. In addition, the T2 relaxation time of the absorbed water was approximately 80 ms, which is longer than the T2 relaxation time (0.3 ms) of the original tobacco T21 water. It was also suggested that the water absorbed by tobacco initially existed in a relatively free environment, such as the outside surface, compared with the original tobacco water contained in compact microstructures. The T21 fraction also showed increased migration; the closer the layers were to the bottom, the larger the T21 fraction signal they presented. Normally, attention is given to the macro-scale water migration; however, in the present study, we proved that there is an inner water migration mechanism in tobacco. Water first attached in the relatively free environment of the tobacco and then penetrated into other compact tissues, which was defined as intralayer water migration. Notably, the T21 fraction in the bottom layer (black) split into two water fractions (Fig. 8), which was in accordance with the previous water assignment. It seems that the two T21 water fractions could be distinguished in samples with high water content.

The bottom layer had the highest signal, as it was adjacent to the water layer and had the highest water absorption efficiency. The signal intensity gradually decreased from the bottom up, indicating that the water gradient was caused by interlayer water migration. As shown in Fig. 6 , after 60 min, the signals of all of the layers increased, indicating that water had migrated to the upper layers. The signal intensity of the 8th layer (not shown) did not increase significantly during experiment; thus, the 7th layer (yellow) was defined as the boundary in this experiment. The 7th layer only absorbed a limited amount of water from the 6th layer, and its water transport to the next layer (8th) could be neglected. The T 2 relaxation profile is shown in Fig. 7 (10 min) and Fig. 8 (60 min). Due to the water migration, the T 2 relaxation of tobacco changed significantly compared with the original sample. In the spectrum of the 7th layer, for example, after 10 min of migration, the T 22 and T 23 fractions in tobacco merged, and the signal was larger than the original T 21 water fraction in tobacco. It seemed that the initial water migration was fast because water reached the 7th level and significantly altered the T 2 relaxation. In addition, the T 2 relaxation time of the absorbed water was approximately 80 ms, which is longer than the T 2 relaxation time (0.3 ms) of the original tobacco T 21 water. It was also suggested that the water absorbed by tobacco initially existed in a relatively free environment, such as the outside surface, compared with the original tobacco water contained in compact microstructures. The T 21 fraction also showed increased migration; the closer the layers were to the bottom, the larger the T 21 fraction signal they presented. Normally, attention is given to the macro-scale water migration; however, in the present study, we proved that there is an inner water migration mechanism in tobacco. Water first attached in the relatively free environment of the tobacco and then penetrated into other compact tissues, which was defined as intralayer water migration. Notably, the T 21 fraction in the bottom layer (black) split into two water fractions ( Fig. 8 ), which was in accordance with the previous water assignment. It seems that the two T 21 water fractions could be distinguished in samples with high water content.

From cou.: 16 On the basis of mathematical models, previous reports have studied water migration in various materials. However, the differences between models and actual experiments hinder the widespread use of models. In addition, models can hardly achieve real-time monitoring and require large amounts of sample. In the present study, the interlayer water migration rate was defined as:

From Soup: 29 Table 1 shows the layer to layer water migration rate in the first 60 min. At each period of migration, the migration rate between 0–1.5 was the highest of all because the 0th layer could absorb water directly and had highest water content. All of the layers showed the highest migration rate in the first 10 min, and the rate of each layer decreased with migration time. At first, due to the high moisture gradient between the wet layers and dry layers, the water migration from the bottom to the upper layers was at a relatively high rate. After 10 min, each layer contained a certain amount of water, and the interlayer moisture gradient decreased, leading to a decrease in the interlayer migration rate. The intralayer migration rate is shown in Table 2 . Similar to the interlayer migration, the initial migration rate was high and then decreased with migration time. It is reasonably suggested that the T 21 water fraction of the 0th layer was saturated because the intralayer migration rate after 30 min was insignificant.

From Soup: 31 In the present study, tobacco was studied by multi-NMR relaxometry methods. Though the water and oil fractions had overlapping T 2 relaxation times, their signals could be distinguished in the two-dimensional T 1 – T 2 correlation spectrum. There were two water fractions and one oil fraction in tobacco located in different substructures of tobacco. The multi-layer water distribution profiles during water migration in tobacco were studied by SE-SPI. The two water migration mechanisms in tobacco were firstly reported, and the migration rate was calculated.
