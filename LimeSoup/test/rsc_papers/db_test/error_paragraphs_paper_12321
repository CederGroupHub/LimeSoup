From cou.: 1 Depolymerization of lignin into its monomeric constituents is a promising way to produce aromatic bulk chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass and lignin waste streams. In order to obtain an industrial product further downstream, processing of the monomeric mixture will be needed. Therefore, we selectively removed methoxy (MeO) and hydroxy (OH) groups from mixtures of monomeric lignin model compounds on a Pt-based catalyst in an aqueous environment and achieved a narrow range of products, which is controllable via limiting the hydrogen supply. This well-balanced supply of hydrogen is crucial to push the reaction towards phenol while simultaneously preventing ring hydration. We could show that at temperatures of approx. 250 °C with a Pt-based catalyst the MeO group was converted into an OH group while reacting with water to methanol (MeOH). This MeOH is then instantly reformed on the Pt catalyst to 3 H2 and CO2 providing an in situ supply of hydrogen directly at the active sites of the catalyst, which facilitates MeO and OH group removal. Therefore, the amount of MeO groups limits the supply of hydrogen. Ring hydration does not occur because the hydrogen is produced in situ and consumed immediately on the catalyst. Adding small amounts of MeOH in the beginning accelerates the reaction as expected; nevertheless the hydrogenation of phenol seems to be the slowest reaction in the reaction route, making it a promising product of the process. Pt catalysts with γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2, and activated carbon as a support were investigated, while a Ni/C catalyst was also tested as an alternative. Pt/ZrO2 showed the best results with regard to conversion, followed by Pt/C and Pt/γ-Al2O3. Pt/TiO2 and the Ni/C catalysts showed no significant conversion. The support comparison reactions were done for ten hours taking liquid samples every hour. A simple reaction network is proposed and reaction rates are estimated and then fitted onto measured data.

From cou.: 2 New processes to supply the chemical industry with bulk chemicals from biomass feedstocks, characterized by a neutral impact on the greenhouse effect, are of increasing importance. Aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene (BTX) as well as the corresponding phenols and ketones, are very important platform chemicals. These commodities cannot be easily replaced by products from natural gas, opened up by the fracking chain. The decomposition of lignin, one of the main constituents of lignocellulosic biomass, via liquid phase reforming is an alternative route to meet these demands and to provide aromatic bulk chemicals from renewable resources. Energy intensive drying of the lignin is not necessary when reforming is performed in the aqueous phase. Since the structure of lignin is dependent on the nature of the biomass and is also modified by the pre-processing in which it is separated from the cellulose and hemicellulose, it is necessary to develop adjustable processes which are able to cope with different types of lignins.1

From cou.: 3 The long term goal is the development of a process network that can be operated in a bio-refinery and is capable of valorising all components of the supplied biomass independently of its source. Separation and conversion of lignin into valuable products is the most difficult process in the bio-refinery, because lignin is a very stable biopolymer. In order to decompose it under hydrothermal conditions into fragments with a narrow distribution of products, the most important task is the development of a catalyst with the desired activity and selectivity, characterized by high stability under the hydrothermal reaction conditions.1 Following the development of a strategy for the depolymerization of lignin, possibilities for further downstream processing have to be investigated.

From cou.: 4 Lignin is a natural amorphous polymer consisting of methoxylated phenylpropenyl fragments (coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols) that are randomly connected through carbon–carbon and carbon–oxygen bonds. Depending on its source, lignin consists of up to 48% of β-O-4 and up to 32% of α-O-4 bonds whereas the strongest ether bond, 4-O-5, only makes up ca. 7%.2,3 The major part of the remaining bonds is carbon–carbon links.4 While most of the β-O-4 bonds are cleaved during solubilisation or pre-processing, it is still a challenge to cleave the remaining recalcitrant bonds.1,5–8 Formation of new bonds via repolymerization during the process not only lowers the yield, but also leads to deactivation of the catalyst via coking reactions.1,9,10 Another task is to narrow the product distribution of the monomer and dimer arenes in a second step.

From cou.: 5 The one-step conversion of lignin has been reported several times and involves the catalytic depolymerisation primary over oxidative routes and yields more functionalized monomers, e.g. vanillin.11 However, the yields are low and there is no report about a one-step conversion of lignin directly into simple phenolics as it is way more difficult to depolymerize the biopolymer and at the same time selectively remove functionalities from the arenes keeping their aromaticity intact.11 Zakzeski, Jongerius et al. used a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst on different sorts of lignin dissolved in an alkaline ethanol/water solution for depolymerization.12,13 A subsequent HDO in dodecane over CoMo/Al2O3 and Mo2C/CNF at 300 °C and 50 bar H2 pressure showed promising results for the removal of oxygenated groups.12 Other investigations concerning the depolymerisation of lignin show that reforming lignin and lignin model compounds in alcohol with nickel based catalysts, as a cheap alternative to noble-metal based catalysts (e.g. Pt, Pd, etc.), results in the basic monomers of lignin (methoxylated phenylpropenyl fragments).4,14,15

From cou.: 6 Song et al. studied the reactions of birch lignin in different solvents over the Ni/C catalyst, while Molinari et al. and He et al. depolymerized model compounds (mainly di-aryl ethers) via Ni based catalysts.14–16 In all these reactions the nickel based catalysts exhibited promising cleavage of the ether bonds, including the recalcitrant 4-O-5 bond. Since this paper focuses on the selective removal of side-chains from arenes, the effect of a nickel catalyst for this kind of reaction was also analysed.

From cou.: 7 In previous studies by our group, we showed that in reactions of guaiacol in liquid hot water, a significant reaction rate was observed at temperatures above 200 °C.17 A reaction network was suggested and first test runs with addition of hydrogen and MeOH were performed. Here, MeOH proved more effective in promoting the hydrogen consuming reactions in the network. In a following study, Theiss conducted reactions with Pt/γ-Al2O3 in the same autoclave as that used for the reactions in this paper.18 The temperature was 245 °C and the size of the catalyst particles was in the range of 0.6–1.0 mm. Four repetitive 24 h test runs with the same catalyst were conducted without stirring. The catalyst was dried for about 24 h at atmospheric pressure at 80 °C between each run. The conversion of guaiacol was between 85 and 95% and the catalyst showed only minor deactivation. Theiss also performed reactions with catechol and phenol in liquid hot water and the same Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.18 Without the addition of methanol no conversion could be obtained, indicating that only the MeO group is prone to dissociation if no additional hydrogen donor is present.

From cou.: 10 All catalysts were prepared by an incipient-wetness impregnation method with further drying and calcination steps. Hexachloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O) for the platinum supported catalysts and nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) for the Ni/C catalyst together with water were distributed on the supporting material. The water amount depends on the absorbing capacity of each support. After the drying procedure at room temperature for twelve hours the Pt/γ-Al2O3, Pt/TiO2 and Pt/ZrO2 catalysts were put in an oven for 24 hours at 80 °C. Subsequently they were calcined for three more hours at 500 °C (Pt/γ-Al2O3) and 550 °C (Pt/TiO2, Pt/ZrO2), respectively. The Pt/C catalyst was reduced under a nitrogen/hydrogen atmosphere (70 vol%/30 vol%), heated to 300 °C (3 K min−1) and held for two hours at this temperature. The Ni/C was reduced in a nitrogen flow at 450 °C for two hours. The metal loading was 3 wt% for the platinum based catalysts and 10 wt% for the Ni/C catalyst.

From cou.: 11 The autoclave used was a Roth1 stainless steel (X6CrNiMoTi17-12-2 or AISI 316 Ti) autoclave (art. no.: 2094.1) equipped with a heating jacket and a magnetic stirrer. Since the temperatures exceeded 250 °C, a glass covered stirring bar (Roth art. no.: PK62.1) instead of a Teflon® one was used. The autoclave was equipped with an electronic pressure indicator (Huba Control) and a thermocouple (Thermo Sensor). The readings of both were recorded and logged every 10 s. A sketch of the reactor set-up is given in Fig. 1. To be able to take liquid samples during the reaction, a sampling device was designed and built. This device takes an aliquot of the complete reaction mixture (including the catalyst). The catalyst was also sampled to not change the reactant/catalyst ratio in the autoclave. The volume of the samples taken was approx. 5 ml. To ensure having removed the old liquid in the capillary, 5 ml (an amount significantly higher than the capillary's volume) was drawn and discarded every time before sampling.

From cou.: 16 For all reactions, demineralized water was used as the solvent. The aromatic compounds (syringol, guaiacol, catechol, and phenol) were dissolved in equi-molar amounts relative to 1.5 wt% guaiacol (i.e. 0.24 mol l−1). In the experiments with methanol, it was added stoichiometrically with regard to the produced H2 from the MeO groups. In other words, the number of H2 molecules produced after complete conversion of MeOH is the same amount as the number of MeO groups at the beginning of the reaction. Since the reformation of MeOH with water produces three H2, one third of the molar amount of guaiacol (two thirds when using syringol) was added (see eqn (1)).where nMeO is the number of methoxy groups of the aromatic ring which are to be removed. In the case of 1.50 g guaiacol this means that 0.13 g of MeOH was added prior to the reaction (eqn (2)). After having added all chemicals the catalyst was added to the reactor which was then closed and checked for gas tightness up to 60 bar with a N2–H2 mixture. A hydrogen detector was used to check the test rig for leakages. The pressure was released and the reactor was purged several times with N2. Before starting the reaction, the nitrogen pressure was increased to approx. 5 bar. The reactor including solvent, reactants, catalyst, and stirrer was weighed before the reaction. It was then heated to reaction temperature (245 °C in most cases) within 60 minutes and the magnetic stirrer was set to 550 rpm. Within predefined timespans, liquid aliquots were drawn from the reaction mixture via the custom built sampling device. After ten hours the heating jacket was turned off, the gas phase was sampled after cooling as described and afterwards the reactor was opened for sampling of the remaining liquid phase. The reactor with its contents and the liquid samples are again weighed after the reaction to check for any mass losses of the liquid phase. The mass of the gas phase lost is considered to be insignificant.

From cou.: 17 All the catalyst particles were ground to a fine powder during the stirred reactions. Therefore, the sediment of reactor contents was a grey or black slurry and was filtered out after each test run. Before analysing the liquid samples with GC-MS and GC-FID each aliquot was filtered using a 0.22 μm membrane syringe filter to remove solid particles from the samples.

From cou.: 18 The kinetics is described in the form of a set of differential equations (see the ESI†). Some general assumptions are that the reactions take place in a regime where only microkinetics is important, i.e. surface and pore diffusions have a negligible effect. Detailed modelling of active centers on the surface of the catalyst will be omitted for the model presented. A more complex model using a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, assuming that all substances have to adsorb for reaction, desorb for freeing an adsorption site and to be found in the liquid phase, is the subject of work in progress. In order to determine the adsorption capacity an experiment done with guaiacol and only a catalyst support (ZrO2) was done. Here, no reaction products occur and the difference between guaiacol in the beginning and after two hours at 245 °C is considered to be the adsorption/desorption equilibrium at the defined conditions. An equi-molar mixture of guaiacol and catechol was also tested on the same support to take competitive adsorption of these species into account. Deactivation of the catalyst will be described as coking as in eqn (3) taken from Butt and Peterson (1988):19where keff. is the vector of the effective reaction rate constants. nCoke & Poly, max is defined as the amount of Coke & Poly after the reaction came to a halt. Since the form of the coke is as yet unknown, it is difficult to describe the usage or production of hydrogen during the process. When assuming the coke as cyclic condensed and saturated rings, hydrogen is produced when the side chains are removed and during condensation. The MeO group is also considered to produce CO2. Nevertheless, the coking mechanism is described as hydrogen neutral in the reaction network, since this gives good results for the function fit, while a hydrogen producing or consuming mechanism gives less positive results. All aromatic compounds are considered to be able to contribute to coking, and there is only one type of coke existing.

In order to determine the adsorption capacity an experiment done with guaiacol and only a catalyst support (ZrO 2 ) was done. Here, no reaction products occur and the difference between guaiacol in the beginning and after two hours at 245 °C is considered to be the adsorption/desorption equilibrium at the defined conditions. An equi-molar mixture of guaiacol and catechol was also tested on the same support to take competitive adsorption of these species into account. Deactivation of the catalyst will be described as coking as in eqn (3) taken from Butt and Peterson (1988): 19 where k eff. is the vector of the effective reaction rate constants. n Coke & Poly, max is defined as the amount of Coke & Poly after the reaction came to a halt. Since the form of the coke is as yet unknown, it is difficult to describe the usage or production of hydrogen during the process. When assuming the coke as cyclic condensed and saturated rings, hydrogen is produced when the side chains are removed and during condensation. The MeO group is also considered to produce CO 2 . Nevertheless, the coking mechanism is described as hydrogen neutral in the reaction network, since this gives good results for the function fit, while a hydrogen producing or consuming mechanism gives less positive results. All aromatic compounds are considered to be able to contribute to coking, and there is only one type of coke existing.

From Soup: 29 There are no concentrations available for the gas phase other than the final concentration at the end of the reaction. This last value was taken for the function fit. CH 4 and CO 2 appear only as products but do influence the calculation of the reaction rates. The ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 indicates the ratio of the reactions of the MeO groups with H 2 to OH groups to the reaction of the MeOH reformation, which, without MeOH addition, is a direct function of the reaction of the MeO groups with water. The MeOH reformation is the only internal hydrogen source speeding up the reaction of MeO to OH groups and enabling new reaction routes, like the direct complete removal of MeO to yield MeOH (see Fig. 2 ). Since H 2 is an important reactant, its amount has to be modelled during the simulation. Hydrogen does appear as a molecular gas, solubilized in the liquid phase and bound to the active centers of the catalyst. While all three are in dynamic equilibrium, only the hydrogen on the active centers is important for the reaction rates. In the simple model all hydrogen is assumed to be available for the reaction, while the more complex model will give the possibility of hydrogen adsorption and desorption, allowing for a more realistic hydrogen modelling. Solubility of gases in the liquid phase is ignored, since Henry's constants at the given temperature are negligible for CO 2 , CH 4 , and H 2 in water. 2 Only the solubility of CO 2 in water at ambient temperature is taken into account to determine the final amount of CO 2 after the reaction.

From Soup: 36 Fig. 3 shows the reaction of guaiacol in water on the Pt/ZrO 2 catalyst. While guaiacol is consumed, catechol and phenol are produced. A guaiacol conversion of 96% is achieved after ten hours. 45% of the starting material is converted into catechol and 27% into phenol, while the balance of 24% is assumed to be coke and re-polymerized aromatic compounds formed on the catalyst surface from the aromatic monomers. Methanol is produced as an intermediate and small amounts appear between 30 and 200 minutes. The gas phase consists of CO 2 and CH 4 . CO concentrations were below the detection limits of the GC-TCD (<10 ppmv) in all test runs. The methoxy transfer ratio is 1.26, which means that some carbon atoms in the gas phase originate from aromatic rings in the liquid phase that were decomposed into smaller molecules. According to the proposed reaction network the CH 4 yield equals the yields of the reaction of guaiacol with H 2 to catechol (reaction 9), while the amount of CO 2 is comprised of reactions 8, 10, and 11. A CH 4 /CO 2 ratio larger than unity is a clear indication that reaction 8 is slower than reaction 9. The fact that there is more CO 2 and CH 4 in the gas phase than expected from the decomposition reactions of guaiacol indicates that the formation of coke and the re-polymerization play some role, both of which might be linked to the release of CO 2 and CH 4 . We will further elucidate this in our future work. Moreover, we will investigate why there is no hydrogen found in the gas phase.

The Pt (1 1 1) and Pt (2 0 0) peaks on a ZrO 2 support are indicated. Since Pt is only 3 wt% and the peaks overlap with native ZrO 2 peaks, it is difficult to say something about the Pt phases.

Therefore, reactions in a continuous plug flow reactor are being made, which will give a clear indication of qualitative and quantitative catalyst deactivation.

From Soup: 40 The simulation of the reaction network was done in comparison with the results of the reaction of guaiacol on Pt/ZrO 2 . Fig. 5 and 6 show the results of the simulations. The starting and final values for the reaction rate constants of the minimum problem are given in Table 3 . The constants indicate that the reaction of guaiacol with water must be slow compared to all reactions with hydrogen. Guaiacol reacts to catechol and to phenol, while more slowly in the case of the latter. The k -values for the reactions with hydrogen are approximately one order of magnitude larger in the reaction without methanol addition. A test run with only methanol and Pt/ZrO 2 gave a value for k 12 of about 2 × 10 −4 s −1 , similarly to that of the reaction with methanol addition. The reaction to methyl-catechol seems to be insignificant and was taken out of the function fit. Formation of methanol and hydrogen is problematic in the reaction without methanol addition. While the results show an increase in methanol between 30 and 200 min ( Fig. 5 ), the simulation does only indicate a minor increase. When speeding up methanol production in the beginning, too much hydrogen will be produced and cannot be consumed, since coking has already led to deactivation. The mechanism for hydrogen production/consumption seems incomplete. Adsorption and simulation of active centres can help here. Additional insight into the mechanism of coking and polymerization is also necessary. These aspects will be looked at in our future work.

From Soup: 44 Furthermore, Zakzeski, Jongerius et al. used a Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst for the depolymerization of different lignins in water/ethanol mixtures (1 : 1 v/v) in a batch autoclave. 13 A co-catalyst (H 2 SO 4 , phosphotungstic acid hydrate, or NaOH) was used to increase the depolymerization performance. The usage of the catalysts yielded significant amounts of different monomeric substances but did not lead to a purified monomeric mixture, as could have been expected by the findings of this paper. This can be attributed to a strong deactivation of the catalyst by coking. Our experiments show that this is very probable while inactivity due to steric hindrance cannot be excluded. Since the experiments of Zakzeski, Jongerius et al. were performed in an ethanol/water mixture at 225 °C, a sufficient supply of hydrogen via the reformation of ethanol with water should be given. As stated previously, Jongerius et al. found that guaiacol and lignin inhibit or even prevent the transformation of γ-Al 2 O 3 into boehmite. 21 This inhibition could be caused by the coking of the catalyst, which not only blocks the active centres, but also hinders the uptake of water of the alumina.

From cou.: 56 It could be shown that a selective side chain removal without ring hydration from guaiacol and syringol in liquid hot water with a platinum catalyst is feasible.
From Soup: 56 We investigated the reaction of guaiacol and syringol under hydrothermal conditions on heterogeneous catalysts to remove the side chains. We hypothesize that guaiacol (and syringol) starts adsorbing on the catalyst prior to the reaction. The reaction products have to desorb after the reaction. Either Pt is necessary for adsorption or the amount of adsorbed species on the bare support itself is very low. This is postulated because the reaction with ZrO 2 support gave no conversion of guaiacol, indicating that guaiacol remains in the liquid phase. Popov et al. describe the adsorption of guaiacol on alumina with a mechanism where the MeO group is dissociated and the formed catechol is attached on the metal catalyst via its oxygen groups. 22 The first reaction step is the transformation of guaiacol with water to catechol and MeOH. 17,23 The methanol is then reformed with water to produce hydrogen, which fuels further degradation and carbon dioxide. The reaction of guaiacol with water is the slowest in this chain and only takes place as a major route if no hydrogen is present. As soon as hydrogen is present, the guaiacol reacts with hydrogen to catechol and methane and also to phenol, forming additional methanol. All hydrogen reactions are considered fast and are only limited by free adsorption sites and the supply of hydrogen.

From Soup: 57 It is also assumed that some of the adsorbed components form dimers, trimers, etc . They form new (inactive) adsorption sites while at the same time removing monomers from the balance. This forms a coke layer on the catalyst support, blocking other active centres from access.

From Soup: 58 The reactions all come to a stall after a certain conversion. The reactions without MeOH stop after approx. 300 min while the ones with MeOH addition stop after about 180 min. Coke formation is assumed to be the reason for this behaviour and reformation of MeOH is also inhibited by this coke layer. Repetitive reactions with Pt/γ-Al 2 O 3 by Theiss showed the reusability of the catalyst with only minor deactivation when used with a catalyst to guaiacol ratio of 10/3 in weight and having larger catalyst particles (0.6–1.0 mm).

From Soup: 59 Construction of a complete reaction network allows for parameter analysis of the network giving the possibility to maximize the yield of a certain product while minimizing coking. It could also be shown that evaluating the reaction rates of the network is doable. To get a clearer view of the reaction, lower concentrations of reactants and catalyst have to be used. While the former prevents early coking, leading to a deactivation of the system, the latter can indicate if the active sites on the catalyst are rate determining.
