From cou.: 1 The speciation of four selected organic Se compounds (selenocystine, selenocystamine, selenomethionine and selenoethionine) was studied by coupling high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with hydraulic high pressure nebulization (HHPN) for sample introduction into a double focusing magnetic sector field instrument in order to overcome problems from spectral interferences. Reversed-phase chromatography with methanol as the eluent was applied to the separation of the organic Se compounds. The nature of the interferences due to methanol was elucidated by application of high mass resolution. Finally, a mass resolution of R = 1400 was found to be sufficient for resolution of the interferences from the isotopes of analytical significance with which, in comparison with low resolution operation (cf. Part I), detection limits were improved to between 0.002 ng ml−1 for selenocystine and 0.01 ng ml−1 for selenocystamine. With respect to a sample volume of 200 µl, this enabled micro analysis of the compounds with a content below 2 pg.

From cou.: 2 Selenium is an essential element which in its inorganic form appears in the environment, the human body and tissues in four different oxidation states: zerovalent (Se0), in the cationic state (Se4+, Se6+) and in the anionic state (Se2−). The concentration region in which it is physiologically essential is narrower than for any other trace element. Sufficient intake of Se is helpful to reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer;1–3 deficiency, however, can produce disease,4–6 and above the essential range toxicity occurs when high concentrations of Se are absorbed, translocated and incorporated as Se analogues of essential sulfur compounds, because this substitution results in an interference with cellular biochemical reactions.1,7 In general, Se is well known for its very high biological activity.1 Bioavailability and toxicity of Se depend strongly on the chemical form in which the element is present.7

From cou.: 3 For speciation, the highest possible sensitivity is required in medical, environmental and biological applications. This is the reason why atomic spectrometry and especially inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) are finding increasing interest for detection.8,9 ICP-MS with low mass resolution instruments based on quadrupole filters is increasingly applied to speciation of metals and semi-metals owing to its excellent sensitivity.10 Speciation of inorganic and organic Se compounds in environmental,11 nutritional12 and biological13 samples requires the highest possible sensitivity, because the species are present only at ultratrace levels; reviews on different detection techniques are given elsewhere.14–16 For this type of application, however, the performance of ICP-MS is restricted: the sensitivity for Se is comparatively low due to its high first ionization potential, and for all isotopes the determination suffers from interferences, isobaric as well as polyatomic. The sensitivity problem may be overcome to a certain extent by modern sample introduction techniques of high efficiency, such as direct injection nebulization (DIN),17–19 ultrasonic nebulization (USN)20 and hydraulic high pressure nebulization (HHPN),21 or alternatively by hydride generation.22 Except for DIN, these sample introduction techniques can additionally be used to reduce spectral interferences from solvents by use of desolvation systems or by matrix separation in hydride generation.

From cou.: 4 Techniques to overcome problems arising from polyatomic interferences are often a peculiar feature in the development of novel instrumentation in ICP-MS, and different approaches have been presented in the literature, such as the cold plasma technique,23 application of collision and reaction cells24,25 or high mass resolution.26 The application of the cold plasma technique and of collision and reaction cells looks promising as a cost-effective alternative to sector field instruments with high mass resolution. The cold plasma technique is preferably applied to the analysis of ultra-pure chemicals; however, it cannot be recommended for speciation in coupling with reversed-phase (RP) chromatography, because for elements with a high first ionization potential such as Se the ionization efficiency is poor, and severe matrix effects may additionally be introduced from the use of methanol.

From cou.: 6 Application of high mass resolution is, of course, the most effective solution as has been shown for speciation by Gallus and Heumann using an HPLC technique for speciation of Fe in humic substances.28 A survey of the performance of ICP-MS with high mass resolution in general and its use for speciation of metals has been given in a recent review.29Table 1 presents a compilation of prominent spectral interferences in the mass region of the Se isotopes with the resolution necessary for separation of the analyte isotope from its interferent. Polyatomic interferences in general require only moderate resolution. The isobaric interferences from Ge and Kr require extremely high resolution; however, Ge is usually not present at elevated concentrations in environmental and biological matrices and Kr as an impurity in the gas supply is present at only low levels, also. Only the dimers of argon may be a real limitation, because the necessary resolution of up to about 10000 is at the upper end of the accessible range of commercial sector field instruments. Operation of a double focusing instrument at high mass resolution may be useful for reduction of the spectral background; however, one should be aware that this is always accompanied by a loss of sensitivity, so it is doubtful whether any improvement of the detection limits can be realized by interference reduction.

From cou.: 7 With ICP-MS as the detection technique, the separation of the species by means of chromatography has to fulfil some compatibility requirements: on-line coupling should be possible with optimum operational conditions for both techniques, calibration by standards should also be possible, and the risk of spectral and non-spectral interferences should be kept as low as possible. To date, this has been achieved mainly in coupling with ion chromatography.30–32 Goessler et al.30 applied an HHPN system to sample introduction, but used a strong cation-exchange column for separation of inorganic and organic Se compounds. For selenocystine, selenomethionine and selenoethionine, detection limits below 1 ng ml−1 were realized.30 Using on-line vesicle mediated HPLC-focused microwave digestion-hydride generation, González La Fuente et al. have realized detection limits in the range 1–5 ng ml−1 for these compounds also, but in urine as a complex matrix.33 Le et al. have separated inorganic Se from selenocystine and selenomethionine using an RP column and an ion-pair reagent, and detection limits of about 10 ng ml−1 were realized for both substances with a Meinhard nebulizer.34 For speciation of selenite, selenate, selenocystine and selenomethionine, application of HPLC with detection by flame atomic absorption spectrometry and ICP-MS using a cross-flow nebulizer resulted in detection limits in the low ng ml−1 range.31 Li et al. have realized detection limits of 0.18 ng ml−1 Se for selenomethionine using anion-exchange chromatography for separation from inorganic Se and ultrasonic nebulization for sample introduction.32 Application of RP chromatography was only hindered owing to the risk of spectral interferences from organic eluents.

From cou.: 8 Applying a high resolution instrument, we have now investigated the speciation of selenocystine, selenocystamine, selenomethionine and selenoethionine by RP chromatography coupled to ICP-MS. In Part I of this series,35 which presents mainly the development of the analytical procedure, the double focusing instrument was operated in low resolution mode using HHPN as a high efficiency nebulization technique36 with the primary aim of achieving the highest possible sensitivity. Using methanol–water mixtures with proportions up to 10 + 90 (v/v) as eluent, chromatographic baseline separation could be achieved, but only with an increase of the spectral background at masses 77 and 82 u which had been selected for the measurements; nevertheless detection limits below 0.02 ng ml−1 could be realized.

From cou.: 9 While the highest possible sensitivity was the main aim in Part I of our work, the achievement of the lowest possible detection limits by exploitation of the high mass resolution capabilities of the instrument is the main aim of this second part. For this purpose the instrument was operated with high (or at least moderate) resolution to overcome spectral interferences resulting from the organic solvent used for RP chromatography. For reasons of comparability no other changes were made to the analytical procedures of both parts except for mass resolution, as will be indicated in each case.

From cou.: 10 The experimental arrangement including the HPLC system has been presented in detail in the previous paper.35 For a satisfactory baseline separation of the four test compounds a methanol–water mixture (5 + 95, v/v) was sufficient as eluent. Oxygen addition was not necessary with the operational conditions chosen for this investigation. Operational optimization was performed with respect to 103Rh. This is not retained on the column and can therefore be used as an internal standard which, when added to the eluent, produces a constant signal for compensation of any instrumental drift. The operational conditions as compiled in Table 2 were used throughout this investigation unless stated otherwise.

From cou.: 11 A prototype of a double focusing ICP-MS instrument (ELEMENT, Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany) was used for element specific detection. In a deviation from the commercial version this instrument enables continuous variation of the mass resolution between 300 and 7500. The instrument was always adjusted so as to realize a 10% valley separation of interfering mass peaks. Excessive increase of the mass resolution was avoided in order to keep the sensitivity as high as possible in favour of the detection limits. For data acquisition an electric mass scan over a limited interval was favoured against a magnetic scan, because the higher speed of the electric scan is preferable for transient signals such as those present in coupling with chromatography.

From cou.: 13 The selection of Se isotopes for evaluation should be made with respect to the signal-to-background ratio in order to optimize the analytical performance. Isotopes with high natural abundance are generally preferable; however, the background has additionally to be taken into account. As can be seen from Table 1, the interferences from the argon dimers (38Ar40Ar+ and 40Ar40Ar+) are strong limitations for the two most abundant isotopes 78Se and 80Se. The necessary resolution R ∼ 10000 is clearly beyond the accessible range of the instrument used in this investigation, and even for commercial instruments capable of operating at such high resolution settings the sensitivity will be reduced to only a few per cent. of the low resolution value. Therefore, selection of the isotopes 77Se and 82Se is generally a good compromise. However, as already pointed out in Part I, these isotopes suffer from interferences when methanol is used as the eluent. For an estimation of such effects it is therefore important to identify the contributions from organic species, which is made possible by precise mass determination in a high mass resolution mode.

From cou.: 14 For this investigation the HPLC system, omitting the column, was directly coupled to the HHPN unit as a high efficiency sample introduction system. A methanol–water mixture (5 + 95, v/v) without and with a 20 ng ml−1 inorganic Se standard was used for the operational optimization and for investigation of spectral interferences due to methanol. Full baseline separation of methanol-induced polyatomic ions was achieved with a resolution of R = 3000. Sections of the resulting mass spectra for the regions of 77Se and 82Se are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively. For 77Se two interfering polyatomic ions appear (12C51H16O+ and 12C61H5+), and for 82Se three polyatomic ions can be identified (12C41H216O2+, 12C51H616O+ and 12C61H10+). For 82Se the isobaric 82Kr may additionally contribute, because the mass resolution of R = 25000 as required for separation is far above the capability of the instrument (cf.Table 1). Basically, a correction by use of the ion intensity measured at 83Kr may be calculated for quantitative evaluation and for control of the standards, which, however, requires high mass resolution, because as can be seen from Fig. 1(c) the signals of two hydrocarbons (12C41H316O2+ and 12C51H716O+) exceed the signal of 83Kr, and all the other Kr isotopes are also subject to interference.

From cou.: 15 These results verify that high resolution is an effective means to elucidate the influence of organic solvents in ICP-MS analysis, because in this way the analytical determinations derived from low resolution measurements can be checked for accuracy. This is demonstrated in Table 3, in which the polyatomic interferences observed and identified by precise mass measurement in our experiments are compiled. All of them may impede application of RP chromatography or introduce problems for the direct investigation of organic matrices with quadrupole-based instrumentation.

From Soup: 22 Concerning the interference contributions in the mass interval of the Se isotopes, the results are summarized in Fig. 2 . With a resolution of R = 3000 all interferences from hydrocarbons were clearly resolved from the Se isotopes as well as from the argon dimers of different isotopic composition. The interfering polyatomic species in this mass interval must mainly be attributed to the second and third groups as given above. The background equivalent concentration value of these hydrocarbons with respect to the internal standard is at medium to low pg ml −1 levels. Concerning the isotopes selected for this investigation, it becomes obvious from Fig. 2 that 77 Se suffers mostly from the interfering hydrocarbons , and therefore 82 Se is the best compromise between spectral background and natural abundance.

From Soup: 23 As far as we know, there is no model consideration in the literature from which generation mechanisms for the appearance of such hydrocarbons are plausibly proposed. Their appearance, however, demonstrates that a fraction of the organic solvent survives the passage through the plasma. Additionally, it shows that the organic solvent has not completely been removed from the generated aerosol, although a desolvation system was used in this work. The interference levels observed are at least comparable to those of the Meinhard nebulizer. This we found surprising, because the HHPN system as chosen for sample introduction in this investigation includes a two-stage condensating desolvation unit which was known to remove more than 95% of the solvent from the aerosol. 38 Nevertheless, desolvation was not sufficient here for complete interference reduction . Further improvements may be realized with other desolvation techniques such as multistage cryogenic condensation or membrane desolvation. 39 In spite of this deficiency, the sample introduction system is still superior to a Meinhard nebulizer with a Scott-type double pass spray chamber because the sensitivity realized so far is higher by a factor of about 10. 40

The intensity maximum of the interferences appears at a lower flow rate, while the analyte intensity displays maxima at a lower and also at a higher flow rate. For all further investigations a flow rate of 1.1 l min−1 was chosen.
From Soup: 29 The chromatograms show that the intensity decreases significantly with higher resolution. With respect to the peak area, the loss of sensitivity corresponds to a factor of 2.5 for selenocystine , selenomethionine and selenoethionine and of 1.5 for selenocystamine ; the reason for the behaviour of the last species is not yet clear. In general, the loss of sensitivity corresponds to expectation, but is only moderate.

From cou.: 30 Chromatography.
From Soup: 30 An increase of the mass resolution, if only moderate, does result in improved limits of detection (LOD) owing to the lower spectral background. This is demonstrated by the calibration results presented in Table 4 which were obtained for 82 Se by measurements in both low and high resolution modes. The calibration covered the concentration interval from 0.1 to 10 ng ml −1 . LOD were calculated using the 3 σ definition. The relative standard deviation was derived from background measurement over the time interval required for the full chromatographic peak of the respective Se compound.
 ###### 
From cou.: 31 Typical chromatograms as obtained with the RP column (cf.Table 2) inserted into the HPLC system are represented in Fig. 4 including two measurements with different mass resolutions (R = 300, R = 1400). For R = 1400 the 82Se isotope signal is clearly separated from the signals of interfering organic molecules, whereas the signal for R = 300 is made up of the unresolved contributions from the Se isotope and the polyatomic ions. For these measurements, a buffered [30 mM ammonium formate in methanol–water (5 + 95, v/v)] sample containing all four organic Se compounds under investigation at a concentration of 10 ng ml−1 each was injected via a sample loop with a volume of 200 µl.
From Soup: 31 The results in Table 4 demonstrate that the lower spectral background for the only moderately increased mass resolution leads to an improvement of the LOD by a factor of 4 for selenocystine , selenomethionine and selenoethionine. For selenocystamine this does not hold true to the same extent, as discussed above concerning sensitivity. LOD below 0.01 ng ml −1 were finally achieved, corresponding to an absolute value of 2 pg when using a 200 µl injection loop.
 ###### 
From cou.: 32 The chromatograms show that the intensity decreases significantly with higher resolution. With respect to the peak area, the loss of sensitivity corresponds to a factor of 2.5 for selenocystine, selenomethionine and selenoethionine and of 1.5 for selenocystamine; the reason for the behaviour of the last species is not yet clear. In general, the loss of sensitivity corresponds to expectation, but is only moderate.
From Soup: 32 In comparison with the results from quadrupole-based instruments presented in the Introduction, the LOD presented here are lower by up to one order of magnitude. This demonstrates the high sensitivity of sector field ICP-MS instruments even when operated at increased but moderate resolution, so that spectral interferences caused by organic solvents are virtually eliminated. This progress makes RP chromatography more attractive for the speciation of Se. However, for volatile metalloid species such as methylated Se compounds, in situ purge and cryogenic trapping followed by gas chromatography and detection by ICP-MS is superior with detection limits as low as 1 fg ml −1 . 41

From cou.: 33 An increase of the mass resolution, if only moderate, does result in improved limits of detection (LOD) owing to the lower spectral background. This is demonstrated by the calibration results presented in Table 4 which were obtained for 82Se by measurements in both low and high resolution modes.

The relative standard deviation was derived from background measurement over the time interval required for the full chromatographic peak of the respective Se compound.
From Soup: 33 Concerning disturbances introduced by application of organic solvents in ICP-MS , we have shown in this investigation of the speciation of Se that application of higher mass resolution enables separation of the analyte signals from all methanol-induced interferences in RP chromatography . The nature of the polyatomic interferences that appear has been elucidated by precise mass determination with higher mass resolution.

From cou.: 34 The results in Table 4 demonstrate that the lower spectral background for the only moderately increased mass resolution leads to an improvement of the LOD by a factor of 4 for selenocystine, selenomethionine and selenoethionine. For selenocystamine this does not hold true to the same extent, as discussed above concerning sensitivity. LOD below 0.01 ng ml−1 were finally achieved, corresponding to an absolute value of 2 pg when using a 200 µl injection loop.
From Soup: 34 Owing to the reduction of the spectroscopic background the LOD could be improved significantly. This demonstrates that the reduction of the background more than compensates for the loss of sensitivity that is unavoidably connected with the resolution increase which in this case is only low. In coupling with RP chromatography , higher mass resolution is a general requirement to remove the influence of interferences introduced by organic solvents ; in practical applications, however, mass resolution should always be kept as low as possible in order to achieve the lowest possible LOD. High mass resolution is an extremely valuable tool for identification of contributions from interferences such as those introduced here by methanol and, therefore, may be applied to check for accuracy in the application of quadrupole instruments.
