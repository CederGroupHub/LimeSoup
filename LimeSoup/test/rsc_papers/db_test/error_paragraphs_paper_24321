From cou.: 1 The assessment of matrix effects in the quantification of organophosphorus pesticides in fruit and vegetables by GC-NPD, were studied applying ANCOVA. Calibration curves prepared in solvent were compared with calibration curves prepared in a blank matrix extract for eight different commodities, establishing whether the matrix induces systematic or proportional errors in the quantification of the pesticides. In such cases correction functions were obtained and validated by quantifying spiked samples using solvent calibrations and applying the correction functions to the data obtained. The results were compared with those obtained by quantification using matrix-matching calibrations and with those from 100% recovery experiments. It was found that the matrix effects can be avoided using the correction functions. Finally the contribution of the correction functions to the uncertainty of the results was estimated as well as their stability during a four month period.

From cou.: 2 Control programmes on pesticide residue levels are carried out by official and private analytical laboratories to ensure the quality of fruits and vegetables in order to reduce the risk to the consumer.1–4 In this field, the analytical problem has two aspects: on the one hand there is a need to determine a wide range of pesticides in a single run or as fast as possible, because the products are perishable and the number of samples use to be high; on the other hand there is a need to achieve reliability in the determination of such residues, at the low concentration levels established by the legislation as the maximum residue levels (MRLs)5,6 allowed. Both aspects must involve low costs and low environmental contamination (for example, reduction in solvent consumption), but must also have accuracy and representativeness.

From cou.: 3 The first aspect, which is mainly related to additional analytical properties,7 is usually achieved with multiresidue methods.8–10 The ideal multiresidue method requires little sample treatment and minimises reagent consumption but it should be feasible to determine as many analytes as possible. Accuracy, which is among the principal analytical properties, is achieved working in a quality system that ensures the sensitivity, selectivity and precision required. Both objectives have to be balanced depending on the goal of the analytical process.

 ###### 
From cou.: 4 A key aspect in pesticide multiresidue methods is their selectivity. The definition of this term is being revised by IUPAC,11 who recommend its use for referring to the extent to which a given method can determine particular analytes under given conditions in mixtures or matrices, simple or complex, without interferences from other components. In the context of pesticide multiresidue methods the definition of selectivity relates to the matrix effects and/or the presence of interferences. Massart et al.12 distinguish between interferences (for example, co-elution of two compounds in a chromatographic method) and matrix effects, which may affect the analytical signal by increasing the level of random errors and/or introducing a systematic effect on the analytical results (which can be either constant, affecting the blank, or proportional, affecting the analytical sensitivity).

From cou.: 5 In pesticide multiresidue methods selectivities based on multistage separation and detection principles are frequently used. The extraction step has to be general enough to allow quantitative extraction of pesticides with different chemical and physical properties, in the literature screening methods are described using solvents1–4,10 such as ethyl acetate, acetone, petroleum ether and dichloromethane or the use of supercritical fluid extraction.13 With regard to the determination step, chromatographic techniques with different detectors, such as gas or liquid, are the most used due to their capability for separating a wide range of analytes in a single run.

From cou.: 6 Several authors refer to the nature of matrix effects as a ‘protection’ of the analytes from adsorption and/or decomposition mainly in the injection ports of gas chromatography (GC) systems.14,15 Matrix effects in such methods can be reduced in the sample processing step by using clean-up methods.16,17 Chromatographic techniques tend to rely for selectivity on the separation process, or even on the combination of the selectivities achieved with respect to the detection and separation,16 in this sense hyphenated techniques, such as GC-MS or the extended GC-MS-MS, yield an especially high selectivity.11,18

From cou.: 7 However, most routine laboratories tend to minimise the experimental work, avoiding steps such as clean-up (when possible) due to their time-consuming nature and to the likely increase in the uncertainty in the results that each additional step in the analytical process might bring about; hyphenated techniques are also still expensive for many laboratories.

From cou.: 8 Despite the use of such measures matrix effects can still affect the analytical results..14,19–22 The inclusion of matrix co-extractives in the calibration step is a way of minimising the effects of the matrix in the quantification of pesticides. For this, the use of a standard additions method is suggested in the literature,12,23 but the most usual and recommended way to avoid such matrix effects is the use of matrix-matched calibration.23–26 Nevertheless, this measure is again time-consuming and it does not give any information about the extent of such effects.

From cou.: 9 This paper presents a methodology for assessing the matrix effects of eight different vegetable commodities for the quantification of eight pesticides that are analysed by GC using a nitrogen–phosphorus detector (GC-NPD). A statistical treatment allows the estimation of the matrix effects by comparison of calibration curves prepared in solvent and in blank vegetable extracts (matrix-matched calibration). A correction function has been obtained in each case that allows reliable results to be obtained using solvent calibration for quantification. The correction functions have been validated, the uncertainty estimated and their robustness tested during a six month period in which only minor changes in the chromatographic conditions were made.

From cou.: 22 In order to state the matrix effects and to obtain a correction function for each pesticide, a calibration solution prepared in solvent (SC) and a calibration solution prepared using blank matrix extracts (MC) instead of pure solvent were compared. The analyte concentrations in both kinds of standard solutions were the same: 0.20, 0.60, 1.00 and 1.40 mg L−1 for all the pesticides, except for ethoprophos and carbophenothion, which were 0.05, 0.15, 0.25 and 0.35 mg L−1 and for diazinon which were 0.10, 0.30, 0.50 and 0.70 mg L−1. These concentration ranges were chosen on the basis of the MRLs in vegetables allowed by European regulations for such pesticides in the studied commodities.

From cou.: 26 Fig. 2 show the statistical approach for assessing the matrix effects and the Appendix shows the different statistical formulae used for calculating each parameter. The experiments were repeated every month between June and September. Data for each replicate were fitted to straight lines using a least squares method28,29 obtaining an equation for each replicate. In the first step, the analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA)30was applied to the daily replicates of SC and MC in order to check their repeatability during a single day. Such analysis consisted of comparing the slopes using an F-test. If the calculated F value (Fcal) was less than the tabulated F value (Ftab), considering a 95% confidence, the slopes of the replicates did not differ. The same procedure was applied to the intercepts in order to check if the replicates are coincident or parallel. Fcal was also less than Ftab. Thus it could be concluded that neither solvent nor matrix calibration changed during the period of time taken for each batch to be analysed.

From cou.: 27 Under such conditions, a unique regression can be fitted by least squares regression both for SC and for each MC using the twelve data obtained in each calibration set (three replicates at each concentration level).

 ###### 
From cou.: 28 The ANCOVA was applied independently to the data obtained in each monthly experiment, the same conclusions were obtained in all cases. As an example Table 1 shows the Fcal values for the experiment carried out in June. It can be seen that the slopes do not differ statistically for chlorpyrifos-methyl in pepper, ethoprophos in watermelon and parathion-methyl in pepper and courgette (Fcal is minor than Ftab ), in such cases the intercepts were also statistically similar, which means that the above matrices do not exert any effect in the quantification of ethoprophos and parathion-methyl. In the case of chlorpyrifos-methyl in watermelon, similar slopes were obtained but the intercepts differ so that in this particular case a systematic bias affects the quantification of the analyte (Fig. 2). In the rest of the cases the Fcal results were higher than the Ftab values for both the slopes and the intercepts (Table 1), this indicates that there is a significant difference between the solvent and matrix-matched calibrations, which means that the matrix content introduces both a proportional and a systematic bias into the quantification of such residues.

From cou.: 29 A correction function (CF) was calculated each month from the slopes and intercepts of the unique regressions fitted for the SC and MC in each experiment. Both kinds of plots can be correlated using a linear correction function, CCF = A + B·CSC, where CSC is the concentration of spiked samples calculated by SC; CCF is the concentration obtained after applying the correction to the above results; and A and B are the correction coefficients, which are calculated from the regression coefficients of each calibration plot (see Appendix, eqns. (1) and (2)). A CF is then obtained as the mean average of the correction coefficients obtained in June, July, August and September (CCF = Ā + ·CSC). Table 2 shows the correction functions obtained for each pesticide in the different matrices.

From cou.: 30 The reliability of the use of CFs for avoiding the bias introduced by matrix effects in the quantification of pesticides, was tested by quantifying the same spiked samples with both SC and MC and by applying the CFs to the results obtained with SC. The recovery rates31,32 were calculated as the quotients between the amounts of analyte found in each of the three ways (CSC, CMC and CCF, respectively) and the spiked amount (see Appendix, eqns. (3), (4) and (5)). Tables 3 and 4 show the recovery rates obtained with SC and MC. It can be seen that the values are different, and by applying a t-test to the mean of the recovery rates (Appendix, eqn (6)), it was found that when SC was used, the recovery rates are statistically different to the 100% recovery (tcal > ttab), whereas when MC was used the recovery rates are similar to the 100% recovery (tcal is less than ttab), which means that MC is an effective way of avoiding matrix effects in order to obtain accurate results.

 ###### 
From cou.: 31 Finally, the results obtained after applying the correction function to the results obtained with SC were compared with a paired sample test. It was concluded that any statistical difference observed between both methods had a probability of greater than 5%. As shown in Table 5, tcal was less than ttab, and therefore there was no significant difference between the recovery rates obtained with MC and CF.

From cou.: 32 Thus this method is suitable for calculating a correction function that allows statistically similar results to be obtained when solvent calibration is used for quantifying samples instead of matrix-matched calibration, obtaining recovery rates that do not differ from 100%.

From cou.: 34 Finally, the uncertainty associated with the correction function is obtained as the sum of all the above contributions, resulting in a second degree equation that depends only upon CSC for a given value of uncertainty u(CSC). It can be seen that if CSC increases, the uncertainty also increases. Table 2 shows the uncertainty obtained in each case considering u(CSC) = 11% for all pesticides,27 it can be observed that the use of the correction function increases the uncertainty of results by less than 11%; the global uncertainty is in most cases less than 20%. With the use of the correction function one can suppose results of between 40 and 70% of the global uncertainty, such a value is within the uncertainty commonly accepted in the field of pesticide residue analysis.

From cou.: 35 The effects of co-extractives from eight different vegetable commodities in the quantification of pesticides by GC-NPD have been assessed. The methodology proposed consists of comparing the calibration curves prepared in solvent with those prepared in a blank matrix extract by using ANCOVA, a useful statistical tool for such a purpose. This study concluded that matrix effects lead, in most cases, to both systematic and proportional bias in the quantification of the pesticides if a solvent calibration is used for the determinations.

 ###### 
From cou.: 36 A correction function for correcting the matrix effects in each commodity has been proposed. The correction functions obtained showed good stability over a period of four months where only minor changes in the working conditions occurred, such as reagent batches and chromatographic maintenance. A paired sample t-test showed that there was no statistical difference between the results achieved using a matrix-matched calibration and those obtained after applying the correction function to the data obtained with solvent calibration. The use of the correction function might lead to a saving in costs and in the time taken for the analyses in pesticide residue laboratories, by avoiding the need for the extraction of blank samples, saving solvents, enlarging the life of the chromatographic consumables and by making easier the quantification with the use of simple solvent calibration.
