From cou.: 1 Many studies have quantified the cost of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) power plants, but relatively few discuss or appreciate the unique value this technology provides to the electricity system. CCS is routinely identified as a key factor in least-cost transitions to a low-carbon electricity system in 2050, one with significant value by providing dispatchable and low-carbon electricity. This paper investigates production, demand and stability characteristics of the current and future electricity system. We analyse the Carbon Intensity (CI) of electricity systems composed of unabated thermal (coal and gas), abated (CCS), and wind power plants for different levels of wind availability with a view to quantifying the value to the system of different generation mixes. As a thought experiment we consider the supply side of a UK-sized electricity system and compare the effect of combining wind and CCS capacity with unabated thermal power plants. The resulting capacity mix, system cost and CI are used to highlight the importance of differentiating between intermittent and firm low-carbon power generators. We observe that, in the absence of energy storage or demand side management, the deployment of intermittent renewable capacity cannot significantly displace unabated thermal power, and consequently can achieve only moderate reductions in overall CI. A system deploying sufficient wind capacity to meet peak demand can reduce CI from 0.78 tCO2/MWh, a level according to unabated fossil power generation, to 0.38 tCO2/MWh. The deployment of CCS power plants displaces unabated thermal plants, and whilst it is more costly than unabated thermal plus wind, this system can achieve an overall CI of 0.1 tCO2/MWh. The need to evaluate CCS using a systemic perspective in order to appreciate its unique value is a core conclusion of this study.

From cou.: 2 The global energy landscape is changing substantially, motivated by the need to combat climate change. Investment in renewable energy has been in the vanguard of this system change rising from $60 to $200 billion annually from 2000 to 2013, while investments in fossil fuel using technologies continue to dominate by increasing from $500 to $1100 billion in the same period.1 Over 86% of energy consumption is met by fossil fuels with only 2.2% from intermittent renewable sources such as wind and solar.2 Due to immense capital investment and long asset lifetimes the energy system evolves slowly.3 It is therefore likely that fossil fuels will remain vital to the global energy supply for the foreseeable future.4 It is also recognised that fossil fuels cannot continue to be exploited as they have been,5 with a significant fraction of the world's reserves now branded “unburnable”.6 However, the fossil fuels are themselves not “unburnable”, rather the CO2 released from their combustion is “unemittable”, and in this context carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a unique proposition for decarbonising the power sector.

From cou.: 3 There is a growing consensus that CCS† is key to the low-cost decarbonisation of both the power and industry sectors, complementing renewable or nuclear power.5,7–9 The IPCC finds that to achieve a 450 ppm CO2-eq atmospheric concentration by the end of the century (2 °C warming), global mitigation costs are 138% higher without CCS power plants.5 Similarly, the Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group (LCICG) estimate that fully integrating CCS into the UK's energy system reduces costs between 2010 and 2050 by £100–500 billion (≈1–5% of total system cost without CCS availability).7,10 The additional value of CCS power plants in being able to generate carbon negative electricity via bioenergy CCS (BECCS) is also widely recognized.5,7,11,12 Intermittent renewable energy sources (iRES), also referred to as variable renewable energy (VRE),13 unquestionably has an important role to play in decarbonising the electricity system; it is not a case of “renewables or CCS”, but “renewables and CCS”. The key question which therefore arises is what mix of these sources provides the most value to the electricity system.

From cou.: 4 IRES can provide low-carbon electricity, however their power output depends on a fluctuating energy source (wind or insolation) which cannot be controlled. A sufficient level of balancing capacity‡ is required, since even with more iRES capacity installed than peak demand, electricity demand cannot be met at times where the energy source is unavailable. Balancing capacity can come from energy storage technologies, demand-side mechanisms, and conventional firm capacity such as nuclear or fossil fuel power plants. On a practical level, the increasing penetration of intermittent power generation is stressing the electric grid's operability to its limits and is increasing the requirements for reserve and frequency control.15,16 The trilemma between carbon avoidance, cost, and security requires a delicate balance.17,18

From cou.: 5 CCS power plants have the advantage of being both low-carbon (typically 0.05–0.1 tCO2/MWh) and dispatchable. Previous studies have focused on the cost of CCS, but to the best of our knowledge no research has investigated the value provided to the energy system by CCS power plants. Generating technologies operating within the electricity system are required to comply with technical and socio-economic conditions. In addition to meeting environmental constraints, technologies also have to meet operational requirements ensuring security of supply and system operability. In order to assess the value of a given technology to the electricity system, it is crucial that the analysis is performed both for the costs of the technology individually and for the added cost imposed on the system by the introduction of an additional unit of capacity.

From cou.: 6 It is important to note that the first unit of a technology added to a given capacity mix has a different value than the nth unit. For example, the first capacity unit of wind power is extremely valuable to a system given its near-zero short-run marginal costs (SRMC) and its manageable impact on system operability and stability. In contrast, in a wind-rich generation mix, increasing the wind capacity further could actually increase system costs (i.e. negative value) and operational emissions owing to the requirement for back-up volume and their increased part-load operation.19

However, this work does not aim to perform a complete whole-systems analysis, but rather to highlight the necessity of considering system synergies and to present the background of the integration problem in an illustrative example differentiating between intermittent and firm capacities.

From cou.: 9 The cost of electricity is simply described by its price: £42/MWh in 2014 in Britain.20 The value of having access to a reliable electricity supply is much greater, despite it being largely taken for granted in many societies. The Value of Lost Load (VoLL) is a measure of the damage caused to the economy by a loss of power supply.21–23 This concept enables us to contrast the cost of electricity with its economic and societal value, and indicates the dependency of modern economies on reliable electricity supply.

From cou.: 11 The economic losses caused by power brown-outs and black-outs are two orders of magnitudes higher than the costs of electricity. This emphases the importance of ensuring that the new electricity generation technologies which are being deployed as part of the transition to a decarbonised energy system do not compromise the stability or resilience of the electricity grid.

From cou.: 12 In addition to providing low carbon electricity, CCS-equipped power plants also have the key feature of providing flexible, dispatchable power, which will become increasingly important with the continued deployment of iRES.31 Traditionally flexibility is understood on the process level of managing unit operations, and indicated by parameters such as ramping rates, up times, down times, and so forth. Consequently, it allows power plants to follow the load and to operate in sympathy with iRES.

From cou.: 13 More recently, flexibility from the perspective of the electricity grid, or system operator is becoming increasingly important. Here flexibility of a power plant is not simply the adjustment in power output but the ability to provide the required service to the electricity system at any given point in time. This feature is typically referred to as dispatchability. IRES, being only reactively controllable (e.g., the output of a wind power plant can be turned down when the wind is blowing, but it cannot be increased beyond the available wind power at any given point in time), are non-dispatchable. The implications of this second perspective underpin this paper as it highlights how the value of a specific feature of a technology depends on the network the technology is operating within.

From cou.: 14 Increasing operational flexibility in CCS can impose constraints on the operation compared to conventional power plants.32 The degree to which different variants of CCS technology (amine scrubbing, oxy-combustion etc.) can operate in a flexible manner is a function of the design and operability of the individual technology elements of which the CCS plant is composed. A restriction applicable to all CCS options is for example the part load behaviour of the CO2 compressors (70% minimum stable load32) but other, limitations arise from the individual processes in pre-combustion, post-combustion, and oxy-combustion CCS. Crucial for oxy-combustion CCS are the ramp rates (3% per minute) of cryogenic air separation units;32 whereas for post-combustion processes the solvent regeneration or column design can become limiting factors.

From cou.: 15 Analyses of how to increase CCS power plant flexibility have historically been divided between options that reduce CO2 removal and those which keep the CO2 capture rate constant when operating off the nominal load point. Hydrogen storage for pre-combustion, liquid oxygen storage, solvent storage, or time varying solvent regeneration33,34 for post-combustion or bypassing are currently the most studied techniques.35–40 Strategies to overcome the operational limitations are ample (although not tested at large-scale) and we do see that CCS power plants can operate just as flexibly as their CO2 emitting counterparts,32,41–44 albeit potentially at the expense of greater capital cost.

From cou.: 16 Despite its technical strengths, a lack of understanding of the value which CCS power plants provides to a low-carbon electricity system has, to date, acted as a first-mover disincentive.45 Although current deployment of CCS is mostly limited to the power generation and gas processing sector, industry (e.g. cement and steel industry) is also expecting movement towards CCS.46,47 Cost reductions from experiences in the power sector may function as an enabler for the use of CCS in industrial decarbonisation. The IPCC suggests that limiting temperature rise requires an increase in CCS investment rates almost on par with renewables (+100% by 2029 compared to 2010), whereas unabated fossil fuels experience strong divestment (−20% by 2029 compared to 2010).5

From cou.: 19 Although the importance of CCS is clear, only economic measures defined through coherent long-term policies can convince the industrial and energy end-use sectors to invest in and deploy this technology. Using technology prices or LCOE measures do not adequately value at the system level the production of dispatchable, low carbon power and these approaches can have major shortcomings evaluating system integration costs.60 The overall value of a given technology to the electricity system can only be understood when technologies are assessed together, not in isolation.

From cou.: 20 Power stations do not only generate electricity, but a range of additional services which are essential for maintaining a permanent and stable supply across the system, including reserve capacity and frequency control. These additional services are mandatory for eligible power producers and indispensable for a reliable electricity supply. We identify three levels defining the system state. On the highest level, the total of installed generating capacity establishes system “adequacy” as the ability to meet peak load. The second level, system “reliability” is secured by a sufficient amount of reserve capacity, whereas on the lowest level inertia is required to ensure system “operability”. Reserve capacity refers to the amount of power that is held by generators or energy storage technologies which is not being dispatched to serve the instantaneous electricity demand but can be called upon if necessary. Inertia refers to the kinetic energy stored in the spinning generators or rotors connected to the system which smoothes out imbalances and is important for frequency and voltage control.

From cou.: 21 The continuously changing level of demand requires the constant balancing of load¶ and generation in the electricity network. The system-wide variables defining the state of the grid are the generation, the load, the frequency, and interchanges.61 A change in load, fluctuation of power output from the generators, as well as unplanned shut-downs of generators or interconnectors constantly disturb the balance on the electric grid.61

 ###### 
From cou.: 22 Restrictions for the operability of the network arise on the consumer-side where the frequency quality matters. In Europe, grid frequency must be maintained at 50 Hz ± 1%. This condition of the network is generally referred to as grid stability. The Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) is manageably small (0.125 Hz·s−1 in 2014/201516) as long as the level of system inertia, all inertia provided by the generators connected to the network, is sufficient. The definition of sufficient system inertia depends on the network size as well as the types of technologies in the capacity mix.62 If the frequency fluctuates beyond the threshold of ±1% generating units may be automatically disconnected from the grid for safety reasons. In a worst case scenario the frequency drop causes a cascade effect where more and more generators are turned off-line resulting in a “frequency collapse”, often with far-reaching impact.61

From cou.: 24 The maintenance and functionality of these services is indispensable for reliable electricity supply. However, not all types of power generators are technically capable of providing ancillary services. Depending on the energy conversion process, technologies can feature inertia-rich components (gas or steam turbines, rotational energy) or the potential to provide reserve (stored energy in chemical, potential and other forms). As both sides of the electric system, the supply and demand, are changing this will serve to further complicate the “balancing challenge”.65 Hence, grid stability is to become a limiting factor for an innovative electricity system transition,15,66 and is indeed considered in current energy policies.67 In the following sections we investigate how electricity generation and consumption changes and influences the balancing requirements specifically in the UK until 2050.

As both sides of the electric system, the supply and demand, are changing this will serve to further complicate the “balancing challenge”. 65 Hence, grid stability is to become a limiting factor for an innovative electricity system transition, 15,66 and is indeed considered in current energy policies. 67 In the following sections we investigate how electricity generation and consumption changes and influences the balancing requirements specifically in the UK until 2050.

From cou.: 25 To begin with, we take one step further back from a regional to an international level and briefly discuss the position of the UK's electricity system within Europe. The distribution and of type of power plants across the European Union (EU) depend on a number of factors including indigenous resource availability, political interests and public acceptability. Every country is facing its own specific set of circumstances and is developing its own strategy.

From cou.: 26 We aggregate the technologies into three main categories: firm low-carbon (nuclear, hydro, bioenergy, geothermal energy, imports, and energy storage technologies), intermittent renewables (on- and off-shore wind and solar), and fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil) with and without CCS. This specification emphasises pertinent features of the different fuel types in terms of capacities, operational constraints and environmental impact. Firm low-carbon generators provide dispatchable electricity at very low emission rates. Despite an increasing quality in weather forecasting, the source of intermittent power generation (wind or insolation) is inherently uncontrollable in time and intensity. Power generation from fossil fuels causes greenhouse gas emissions but can be adjusted quickly and operate flexibly. Fig. 2 summarises the shift in electricity generation by fuel over the past four years from 2010 to 2014 for selected European countries. Historically, power systems have been predominantly firm and controllable generation: a transition to systems dominated by iRES is unprecedented.

From cou.: 27 All European countries have moved towards renewables and a reduction in fossil fuels in recent years. However, it is also clear from Fig. 2 that they are all moving in different directions. Often the individual movements are only possible because they happen in conjunction with neighbouring systems. For example, Denmark (DK) as a relatively small country produces 30 TWh/year in almost equal parts from wind and fossil sources.68 However, with a peak power demand of ∼5 GW (relative to the UK with ∼60 GW peak demand) 30% of inland generated electricity is exported and 30% of Denmark's consumption is met by imported electricity.68 The possibility to operate an electricity system without firm low-carbon capacities highly depends on interconnections and regional sources.

From cou.: 31 Within the two branches, data is in overall agreement. Fig. 4 visualises the corresponding fuel mix for the different 2035/50 systems. There is a marked transition from an electricity system dominated by unabated fossil fuels to one in which a much larger role is played by nuclear and iRES. All scenarios in the “green” branch start including fossil power plants with CCS starting from 2019 to 2025. Power generation from unabated coal disappears in every “green” scenario by 2050, CCS gains ground and ultimately contributes 20% of electricity generation in the UK. These results are in agreement with other electricity projections by the IPCC.5

From cou.: 34 The role of ancillary services as tool to maintain supply reliability and grid stability is essential. When comparing power technologies it is again important to clearly differentiate between firm and intermittent generators. Conventional power generators such as fossil-based systems (or energy storage technologies) are referred to as firm capacities and due to the (theoretically) permanent and immediate availability of the energy source (fossil fuel for example), they can commonly meet reserve service requirements. Thermal power plants including synchronous generators are also inherently inertia-rich. On the other hand, intermittent generators such as wind power plants have a predictable but not dispatchable power output. Due to their intermittent nature they cannot be dispatched as demand occurs and chosen by “economic criteria” in contrast to conventional power generating technologies.60 New concepts are being proposed to add reserve and inertia providing features to expand their portfolio of services. The subsequent sections examine how the changing electricity supply and demand affect the balancing requirements for reserve and inertia services.

From cou.: 41 The expected changes in generating capacity over the coming decades greatly influences the level of available system inertia. This property is measured in GW·s, indicating the power output that can be retained only by the kinetic energy stored in the on-line generators. Substituting synchronous generators (such as gas turbines, conventional coal and nuclear plants) by non-synchronous generators such as iRES reduces the total system inertia.79 Currently the level of system inertia in the UK is 360 GW s and is expected to shrink to 150 GW s in the period of 2024–2035,16 in proportion to the rate of installation of iRES.72 Subsequently, this causes a higher RoCoF, a general decrease in system stability, and increases requirements for a higher level of frequency containment.16

In this way, power generators which are traditionally almost inertialess can provide a similar service by rapidly increasing their power output from a part-load operation point.16 However, this type of service cannot be monetarily valued as it is not yet specified by the Grid Code.

From cou.: 44 Although inertia is an essential feature of the electricity grid, there are at present no evident market incentives, apart from individually contracted agreements with the system operator, to promote high-inertial generator types.

From cou.: 45 The major reason iRES and CCS power plants are considered in the technology mix today is their distinguishing characteristic of providing low-carbon electricity. In order to compare emissions from power systems including these technologies we define and investigate a hypothetical capacity unit for the provision of constant power through the year. Intermittent power generators such as wind farms cannot operate at full power continuously as they are limited by resource availability, and so they require back-up capacity to meet electricity demand continuously over the year. Their average power output relative to their installed capacity is referred to as their capacity factor (CF). We assume that conventional fossil-based power generators running at full load have a capacity factor of 100%, meaning in one hour of operation a conventional power plant with capacity size of 500 MW for example can generate 500 MWh of electricity. On an annual average this is an acceptable assumption since base-load power plants operate at CFs of 85–90% due to downtime. Applying the same logic to intermittent power generators, a 500 MW wind farm for instance can provide CFWind 500 MWh in one hour, where the CF for wind generators varies over time and space, and inherently depends on the location of the power plant.

As might be expected, the North Sea and the northern European countries register the highest wind speeds and consequently the highest CFs. Fig. 6 shows the capacity factor distribution in the selected European countries. The spread of CFs for central European countries is greater than for the northern countries such as Denmark (DK) or Great Britain (GB) which can generally rely on CFs between 25–30% onshore. Offshore CFs for the North Sea, which refers to the region most accessible for Great Britain and the Scandinavian countries, reach up to 45–50%.

From cou.: 47 Wind power generators alone cannot provide a full capacity unit in terms of firmness and availability (full load hours). Thus, in order to compare the effects on electricity generation costs and emissions of an operable electricity system, we combine wind with thermal power plants (with and without CCS) where the thermal power plants provide back-up capacity. The Carbon Intensities (CI) measured in tCO2/MWh for different system configurations are shown in Fig. 7. The CIs for the combined wind-thermal systems are calculated as described in eqn (1), where index i represents the different countries, BU indicates the back-up capacity, and W wind power generators. In all cases, CIW = 0 and annually averaged CFs for each country are derived from the underlying data in Fig. 6.

From cou.: 48 Although during operation there are no carbon emissions from pure wind power generators, a capacity unit comprising the available wind energy (regional CFs) shows only a marginally lower CI than purely conventional processes. Hence, the CI of the back-up capacity should be included when stating the emissions of wind power generators. The idea of “associated carbon” refers to the carbon implicitly emitted by “clean” electricity generators which require fossil-based back-up capacity.

From cou.: 49 We find that the CI of electricity coming from combined capacity where wind power generation is backed up by coal-fired power plants (subcritical or supercritical) still exceeds the CI of a conventional Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT) operating independently. Only a combination including CCS technologies can reduce the CI to sufficient levels below 0.1 tCO2/MWh when deployed on coal-fired power plants, and 0.05 tCO2/MWh for CCGT-CCS power plants, respectively. We note that the presented CI levels for power generation from CCS power plants are based on the conservative assumptions in the underlying IECM tool;84 with state-of-the-art power plants and improved capture technologies, CI can potentially be reduced further. Additionally, balancing operation forces back-up power plants to operate off their design point, reducing efficiency and increasing CI further. This latter factor is not considered here, making the calculations presented in Fig. 7 an optimistic estimate for the CI of power generated from capacity composed of a combination of wind and unabated thermal power plants. The effect of a combined wind and solar power integration increases the CI for the results on combined capacities presented in Fig. 7. Since the CF for solar (PV) power generation in the UK is 1/3 the CF for on-shore wind (9% versus 29% annual average85), any mix of wind and solar will be worse than the presented example.

From cou.: 50 Adding capacity to a system does not only displace power generation, it also displaces power capacity. However, due to its intermittent output, the contribution of an increment of electricity generation from iRES changes as a function of how much is present in a given system. The capacity credit (CC) quantifies the fraction of a generator's capacity that can be considered ‘firm’, and is available to be called on when most needed. This fraction also corresponds to the quantity of other generating capacity that is displaced by iRES, without compromising the system's ability to reliably meet peak demand.86,87 Conventional power generators generally have a CC near 100% since they provide inherently firm capacity (not considering outage due to maintenance for instance). For wind power generators, the CC is a function of the wind penetration XW, the percentage of installed wind capacity of total system capacity. This relationship is presented in Fig. 8 based on data from Gross et al.75 and references therein. In a system where wind capacity contributes 5% of peak capacity, i.e., XW = 5%, the CC ranges between 16–31%, at XW = 20% it decreases to 7–24%, dropping to 2–13% once the installed capacity reaches 50%. This is due to the wind power supply uncertainty increasing, leading to the “firmness of capacity” decreasing with the amount of capacity on the system.

From cou.: 51 In this section, we present the results of a thought experiment where we quantify the impact of extensive deployment of intermittent renewable electricity or CCS power plants into an electricity system initially composed of unabated thermal power plants. Our hypothetical system has a peak demand of 62.5 GW, analogous to current UK peak demand. We evaluate the contribution of each technology in increments of capacity towards a reduction in the cost and carbon intensity of the resulting system. The calculations provide insight on the difference between firm and intermittent capacities on the system configuration, cost, and CI. We define a low-carbon electricity system as one with an overall CI of less or equal then 0.1 tCO2/MWh. Table 1 provides the input data for the underlying calculations presented.

From cou.: 52 In our model system, we quantify the amount of thermal and wind capacity required to ensure a reliable electricity supply, meeting the annual electricity demand specified in Table 1. The underlying calculations refer to the half-hourly demand data for the UK for 2013.88Fig. 9(a) illustrates how the total amount of capacity increases with the level of wind capacity in the mix. Although wind capacity can displace some thermal capacity, in line with the CC of wind at that level of penetration, a system including 69 GW of wind capacity, i.e., sufficient wind to meet peak demand, would at most replace 7–22% of existing thermal capacity. This would have the effect of nearly doubling the total asset base required to reliably provide sufficient energy to meet peak demand. This represents an infrastructurally inefficient and capitally expensive system. A purely fossil based system meeting a peak demand of 62.5 GW with a standard reserve margin of 10% would require a total of 69 GW thermal capacity. In a system composed of different types of thermal power plants, base-load units operate at high utilisation rates (>80%) whereas peak load plant utilisation is generally low (<10%). However, the utilisation of thermal power plants in such a system would average 52% meeting 315 TWh/year (utilisation = power output/installed capacity). The integration of wind causes a decrease in utilisation of the thermal asset, dropping from 52 to between 27 and 33%, as a function of the value of CC used at this level of wind penetration. As the rate of plant utilisation decreases, the associated business risk increases, which will in turn increase the cost of capital and consequently the price at which electricity must be sold. At the same time electricity prices become more volatile which requires more state aid and third party regulation.89

This would have the effect of nearly doubling the total asset base required to reliably provide sufficient energy to meet peak demand. This represents an infrastructurally inefficient and capitally expensive system. A purely fossil based system meeting a peak demand of 62.5 GW with a standard reserve margin of 10% would require a total of 69 GW thermal capacity. In a system composed of different types of thermal power plants, base-load units operate at high utilisation rates (>80%) whereas peak load plant utilisation is generally low (<10%). However, the utilisation of thermal power plants in such a system would average 52% meeting 315 TWh/year (utilisation = power output/installed capacity). The integration of wind causes a decrease in utilisation of the thermal asset, dropping from 52 to between 27 and 33%, as a function of the value of CC used at this level of wind penetration. As the rate of plant utilisation decreases, the associated business risk increases, which will in turn increase the cost of capital and consequently the price at which electricity must be sold. At the same time electricity prices become more volatile which requires more state aid and third party regulation. 89
 ###### 
From cou.: 53 A system where CCS power plants are deployed for low-carbon electricity generation is illustrated in Fig. 9. Here, the total amount of capacity remains constant, as CCS power plants could displace thermal power plants on a one-to-one basis. The utilisation of the thermal capacity decreases as it is displaced by CCS-equipped capacity. Early CCS plants operate at 100% load until the installed CCS capacity is greater than 50% of peak demand. Only once this threshold is crossed would CCS capacity begin to become constrained off in the usual fashion, tending towards a final asset utilisation factor of 52%. Early adopters of CCS, however, could enjoy a first mover advantage of high utilisation rates, thus incentivising the creation of new markets and triggering further investment.

From cou.: 63 The LCOE allows for a comparison of investment decisions as it contains key market parameters such as fuel cost, discount rates, or carbon cost. However, the LCOE metric assumes that generated electricity is a homogeneous product.60 This is not the case for power generation through iRES which require back-up or energy storage capacity in order to provide electricity as reliably as conventional power plants. Thus the traditional concept of LCOE lacks a systems perspective when comparing the electricity generation costs iRES and firm generation technologies, as it does not account for the costs imposed upon firm power generators (such as increased cycling and start-up costs) imposed upon firm intermittent power generators.90

From cou.: 64 We address the shortcomings of the LCOE metric by proposing an alternative metric, the total system cost (TSC), and use this to analyse two model systems – the first composed of wind and unabated thermal power plants, and a combination of CCS and unabated thermal power plants in the second. As described in eqn (3), the annualised total system cost (£) is an absolute measure including the capital and operational expenses of all power plants comprising the electricity system. It does not, however, consider the costs of power plant decommissioning. The OPEX factor (including O&M, fuel, carbon) accounts for the total quantity (TWh) of electricity generated over the year. This enables us to explicitly consider the additional costs associated with thermal power plant generation arising from iRES integration. For simplicity, we do not include system infrastructure costs such as transmission and distribution, however, this extension would further elucidate the system impacts of technology integration.

From Soup: 73 Fig. 10(a) illustrates how the additional capital cost of wind power generators is approximately balanced by the reduction in system OPEX arising from fuel consumption. Nevertheless, the total system cost increases by 16% for a maximum deployment of wind capacity. However, the increased deployment of wind power results in a significant reduction in system CI. The system CI reaches 0.38 t CO 2 /MWh at the maximum wind power integration, which equals a reduction of 50% as 50% of electricity demand is met by wind power generation. However, the overall CI does not satisfy low-carbon electricity system requirements of 0.1 t CO 2 /MWh, and indeed is a higher CI than the unabated CCGT plant illustrated in Fig. 7 . For the CCS integrated system in Fig. 10(b) , total system cost increases by 30% at the maximum level of CCS deployment, replacing the thermal capacity entirely. However, the CI is very significantly reduced, resulting in a truly low carbon system with a CI of 0.1 t CO 2 /MWh. ††

From Soup: 74 Fig. 11 compares the aggregate cost of carbon abatement for the illustrative thermal–CCS and thermal–wind electricity systems across their range of CI, and penetration of CCS and wind power plants, respectively. We find that initially the deployment of wind power generators can reduce the systems CI more cost effectively than the deployment of CCS. However, attempting to reduce the CI below 0.45 t CO 2 /MWh exclusively via wind integration causes a significant increase in the amount of total capacity installed and thus the cost of abatement. Indeed, the thermal–wind system cannot achieve a CI below 0.225 t CO 2 /MWh, even at 137 GW of wind in the capacity mix.

From Soup: 75 Considering the role of CCS, we find that 20 GW of CCS achieves the same amount of decarbonisation as the deployment of 44 GW of wind. Moreover, the deployment of 69 GW of CCS reduces the CI to 0.1 t CO 2 /MWh – something which is unachievable with the deployment of iRES alone. However, initially, deploying CCS has an increased marginal abatement cost over wind deployment. Therefore, in the context of this analysis, the cost-optimal solution is first the deployment of 44 GW of wind and the subsequent deployment of sufficient CCS to displace the remaining unabated thermal plant.

From Soup: 76 Note that this is a static analysis and so we have not assumed any change in cost of technology as it is deployed, consistent with the NOAK plant cost assumptions presented in Table 1 . Given that the wind industry is relatively mature, this is a reasonable assumption. However, in the case of the CCS industry, this is conservative, and one would expect significant cost-reduction to be observed as a result of increased deployment, and in particular as the marginal cost of developing transport and storage decreases.

From Soup: 81 Our analysis indicates that, in the absence of CCS-equipped power plants, wind power provides a limited reduction in the carbon intensity (CI) of a given energy system. This statement comes with the caveat that wind power provides an initially cost-effective means for the first steps in decarbonising an energy system. Compared to electricity generation from unabated coal or gas power plants, the integration of wind power to a combined unabated thermal–wind capacity unit can reduce the CI by 18–30%. The integration of CCS technology, however, reduces emissions per MWh by 87–88%, ‡‡ noting that this figure has the potential to improve in line with advances in capture technology.

From Soup: 82 We have presented the results of a thought experiment wherein we evaluated the environmental and economic impacts of decarbonising an electricity system composed initially of unabated thermal power plants with wind and CCS. We find that the installed wind capacity can only marginally displace thermal capacity due to its relatively low capacity credit. A high deployment of wind power capacity would increase total system cost by 16% and reduce the CI from 0.78 to 0.38 t CO 2 /MWh. However, such an electricity system contains nearly double the amount of capacity that would be needed as firm asset to secure supply. Intermittent renewables are able to displace thermal power generation, but cannot substantially displace thermal capacity. The savings in operational and fuel expenses for thermal power generators do not entirely compensate the capital costs added through the installation of wind power generators. Additionally, a reduced market access and distortion of traditional base load and peaking operation for thermal power plants could drive up the cost for electricity generation. In a system where CCS power plants are deployed, unabated thermal capacity can be replaced effectively, resulting in an energy system with generation capacity in line with demand. The option of extensive CCS deployment is estimated to increase total system cost by 30% and reduces CI to 0.1 t CO 2 /MWh. In comparison, a system integrating CCS faces a persistent increase in CAPEX and OPEX in proportion to the amount of CCS capacity installed.

From Soup: 83 The analysis has confirmed the hypothesis that the choice and integration of different power generating technologies significantly impacts system-level characteristics, such as the total amount of necessary capacity, total system cost, and carbon intensity. Investments in supposedly cheap technologies can entail unplanned expenses in areas such as grid stability but also miss the goal of reducing environmental damage. A feasible path of decarbonisation will likely require a combination of intermittent renewable energy and firm low carbon energy technologies. Emission reduction in the electricity sector will cause an increase in total system cost, and a least-cost path to decarbonisation will require the deployment of a portfolio of technological solutions.
