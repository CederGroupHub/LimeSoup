From cou.: 2 Recent studies of ionic liquids as a new alternative reaction media are having an important impact on organic chemistry.1 To date, the use of ionic liquids as reaction media have been reported for Friedel–Crafts chemistry,2 alkylation reactions,3 alkane isomerisation,4 alkylation of isobutane with butene,5 Diels–Alder reactions6 and the Heck reaction.7 Recently we have reported the use of new ionic liquids (such as 8-ethyl (8-methyl)-1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]-7-undecenium trifluoromethanesulfonate) in organic syntheses such as the one-pot synthesis of heterocycles, one-pot aza-Diels–Alder reaction8 and the synthesis of fluorinated alkenes by the Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction.9

From cou.: 3 In our continuous study of ionic liquids as a recyclable media, we describe here the possibility of the reuse of the ionic liquid at 200 °C, proceeding sequential syntheses (domino reactions) involving Claisen rearrangements and cyclization reactions in the presence of a Lewis acid to give 2-methyl-2,3-dihydro-benzo[b]furan derivatives.

From cou.: 4 As the impact of the Claisen methodology in modern synthetic strategies and its application for the preparation of highly functionalized derivatives are well known,10 we initially examined the Claisen rearrangement of allyl phenyl ether at 150 °C for 4 h in an ionic liquid (e.g. 8-ethyl-1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]-7-undecenium trifluoromethanesulfonate 1). The uncatalysed reaction did not proceed. The addition of a Lewis acid (anhydrous scandium trifluoromethanesulfonate, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) induced the Claisen rearrangement and cyclization reactions. After 4 h at 200 °C, 2-allylphenol, 2-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b]furan and the starting material (1∶1∶1) were detected by 1H NMR. When the reaction was carried out at 200 °C for 10 h, the expected rearrangement material, 2-allylphenol, was not produced. The obtained product was 2-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b]furan which was produced from the domino reaction of a Claisen rearrangement and an intramolecular cyclization of 2-allylphenol catalysed by the Lewis acid. To determine the reaction path and 2-allylphenol as a reaction intermediate in this reaction, we examined the cyclization reaction of 2-allylphenol in the system of Sc(OTf)3 and ionic liquid 1 under the same reaction condition. After 4 h of heating, the target material, 2-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b]furan was obtained in 61% yield.11

From cou.: 5 The structure was conformed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Signals at δ 1.38 (3 H, d, J 6.60 Hz) and 4.82 (1 H, m) suggest a methyl group and one proton attached (CHCH3), and then δ 2.73 (1 H, dd, J 15.38, 7.69 Hz) and 3.23 (1 H, dd, J 15.38, 8.79 Hz) suggest the two protons attached on the ring. Further, aromatic protons appeared at δ 6.67–7.09.

From cou.: 6 In the case of 2-methyl-2-propenyl phenyl ether as a starting material, 2,3-diisopropylbenzo[b]furan was obtained in 15% yield. The reaction mechanism, not clear until now, followed a Claisen rearrangement (step a) as the first step to produce intermediate A. Further, A was produced via step b, and then cyclization gave 2,3-diisopropylbenzo[b]furan.
