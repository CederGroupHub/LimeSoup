From cou.: 1 Cell migration is an essential process involved in crucial stages of tissue formation, regeneration or immune function as well as in pathological processes including tumor development or metastasis. During the last few years, the effect of gradients of soluble molecules on cell migration has been widely studied, and complex systems have been used to analyze cell behavior under simultaneous mechano-chemical stimuli. Most of these chemotactic assays have, however, focused on specific substrates in 2D. The aim of the present work is to develop a novel microfluidic-based chip that allows the long-term chemoattractant effect of growth factors (GFs) on 3D cell migration to be studied, while also providing the possibility to analyze the influence of the interface generated between different adjacent hydrogels. Namely, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 4 mg ml−1 concentrations of collagen type I were alternatively combined with 5, 10 or 50 ng ml−1 concentrations of PDGF and VEGF (as a negative control). To achieve this goal, we have designed a new microfluidic device including three adjacent chambers to introduce hydrogels that allow the generation of a collagen concentration step gradient. This versatile and simple platform was tested by using dermal human fibroblasts embedded in 3D collagen matrices. Images taken over a week were processed to quantify the number of cells in each zone. We found, in terms of cell distribution, that the presence of PDGF, especially in small concentrations, was a strong chemoattractant for dermal human fibroblasts across the gels regardless of their collagen concentration and step gradient direction, whereas the effects of VEGF or collagen step gradient concentrations alone were negligible.

From cou.: 2 Regulation of cell migration by gradients of soluble molecules (chemotaxis) has been widely studied during the last few years.1–6 Many biological processes occurring during both normal and pathological functions require the migration of cells in response to chemical gradients.7 Therefore, chemotaxis plays an important role in cell physiology, although its study presents some difficulties, since cells interact with each other and the extracellular matrix in their natural microenvironment, affecting their morphology and phenotype8 and varying depending on each cell type.9 Different kinds of in vitro assays have been used to simplify the biological variables controlling the chemical gradient as well as cell movement and orientation.3,10 For instance, common Transwell assays promote the random and fast movement of cells in response to a chemical stimulus (chemokinesis) and the differential growth and adhesion of cells under the influence of gradients of diffusible chemicals from a source.2 Also, the Boyden Chamber is one of the earliest and simplest assays normally used to study chemotaxis, consisting of two chambers (upper and lower) separated by a porous membrane through which cells can migrate.10–16 Other types of assays such as T-Transwell or colorimetric tests present membrane filters separating the top chamber, where cells were seeded in the first stages, from the bottom zone, where cells are collected for quantification.13 The material of the membrane filter, which recreates the extracellular matrix (ECM), varies for each assay, from polycarbonate to matrigel or collagen,4,12,17–24 as well as the kind of analysis performed. The Zigmond Chamber (based on the Boyden Chamber) is an alternative method where a narrow space separates both characteristic chambers of chemotaxis assays and permits direct-viewing of cells moving across the bridge between those chambers.10,14 Owing to the need to achieve better optical characteristics and accuracy, the Dunn Chamber was developed, which consists of a glass microscope slide with two concentric annular wells.10,14 The cell solution is added into the central chamber moving over the bridge between both wells and visualized under a microscope.10 Following this idea, further improvements were achieved with the Insall Chamber, including easy handling and the possible use of oil immersion lenses.3

From cou.: 3 Morphology, migration and other cell behaviors are also influenced by physical gradients. Indeed, the effect of substrate stiffness on directed cell migration has been widely explored due to its significant role during tissue development, immune response, metastasis or wound healing.25–30 Many authors have studied cell migration under different mechanical conditions, characterizing the gels that often play the role of an extracellular matrix. The stiffness of these gels is usually related to their collagen concentration and associated with changes in pore size. For instance, Fraley et al. (2015) measured the elastic modulus (G′ (Pa)) of several hydrogels and found that collagen concentrations of 1.5, 2 and 2.5 mg ml−1 led to much lower values (under 100 Pa) compared to 4 mg ml−1 collagen type I (500 Pa, approximately).31

From cou.: 5 In this work, we develop a novel and versatile microfluidic device which allows the quantification of 3D cell migration through the interface of continuous collagen-based gels with different concentrations. This chip also allows the simultaneous application of chemical gradients in 3D embedded cells. In summary, our tool could be used to investigate several unresolved queries involved in cell migration. In particular, we study cell behavior by combining different growth factors (PDGF-BB, abbreviated as PDGF, and VEGF in different concentrations) and collagen concentration step gradients in each zone or chamber, separated by an interface. The chemotactic effect of PDGF on fibroblasts has been widely studied, and is used as a positive control in this work to understand the behavior of cells at different concentrations of GF.44,45 On the other hand, VEGF is released by fibroblasts as an inactive molecule,46 so, we used it as a negative control.

From cou.: 8 Based on the main characteristics of the microfluidic devices designed by Farahat et al.,48 we have developed a new geometry that uses trapezoidal columns to support the hydrogel via surface tension (see Fig. 1). The chip consists of a central chamber divided into three channels. The central cavity lodges the cells seeded while two symmetric and adjacent channels allow hydrogel filling. Two extra lateral channels allow the introduction of cell culture medium and growth factors in order to create the chemical gradient. Fig. 1D illustrates the main chip dimensions. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows a picture of the microdevice next to a coin to compare the scale.

From cou.: 9 NHDF cells were cultured in Fibroblast Cell Basal medium with growth supplements (Lonza) in a 37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO2. HEK 293T (human embryonic kidney) cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS (Lonza) and 100 U ml−1 penicillin (Life Technologies) in a 37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO2 in order to generate the virus. 293T cells were seeded at 4 × 106 cells per 100 mm dish and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2, one day before transfection. These embryonic cells were co-transfected with 3 μg of pLOX-CWgfp (Addgene Plasmid #12241), 3 μg of psPAX2 (Addgene Plasmid #12260) and 3 μg of pMD2G (Addgene Plasmid #12259) by using Fugene 6 reagent (Promega). At about 18 hours post-transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium, and 48–72 hours post-transfection, the supernatant containing the viruses was collected, filtered through a 0.45 μm pore size filter (Whatman), and 1 μl of polybrene (10 mg ml−1) was added to 1 ml of virus to enhance lentiviral transduction. The infective virus was stored at −80 °C.

From cou.: 13 Interfaces were generated after the consecutive polymerization of each adjacent hydrogel. Since the central hydrogel was the first matrix added to the device, a meniscus-like shape appears due to surface tension and is maintained, while the other gels introduced by the lateral channels settle and establish crosslinking between networks (see Fig. 1B). To visualize these interfaces, confocal reflection of hydrogels was performed according to the specified instructions described in the Image acquisition section. Despite the variability found in these interfaces in terms of thickness, mainly due to the manual process, no significant effects on cell motility were observed among different repetitions and different chips. Sections were analyzed with a Super Plan Fluor 40× objective using z-stack scanning and obtaining slice images of this region, each of 2 μm, to check the ability of cells to cross the interface (Fig. S2, ESI†).

From cou.: 14 To characterize the transport of growth factors used as chemoattractants in our assays, diffusion experiments using 20 kDa fluorescently labelled dextran (FITC–dextran, Sigma Aldrich, Germany) were performed. This particle has been used due to the similarities with PDGF in terms of molecular weight as well as in other diffusivity constants.50 The solution was injected simultaneously in both reservoirs of the same channel, diffusing homogeneously along the hydrogels. PBS was used to refill the opposite reservoirs in order to equilibrate the system. A 2X CPI Plan APO objective was used to visualize the diffusion phenomenon under a Nikon D-Eclipse C1 Confocal Microscope, acquiring fluorescence images every 500 ms for a total of 3 hours. Furthermore, the diffusion profile was obtained for the rectangular area between two trapezoidal posts starting in the entrance of channel 1 up to the end of channel 2, following the nomenclature given in Fig. 1C (see the diffusion of this fluorescent molecule into the whole device in the ESI,† Video S1).

From cou.: 15 After overnight incubation of seeded microdevices, the corresponding GFs following the conditions specified in Table 1 were added into the indicated input channel. Control devices were only rehydrated with cell growth media. To avoid the evaporation of reservoirs and the increase of GF concentration, channels were refilled every two days with the appropriate culture medium. In this process, the medium was removed from one of the reservoirs of each channel equilibrated by pressure differences before the diffusion process starts and achieving the same height of liquid in both reservoirs on the same side of the device.

From cou.: 17 A Nikon D-Eclipse C1 Confocal Microscope equipped with a Plan Apo VC 60XH objective and multichannel fluorescence imaging was used for both the visualization of the collagen network interface and the acquisition of complete images. Phase contrast and fluorescent (GFP) images were captured with a Plan Fluor 10X/0.30 OFN25 PH1 DLL Nikon objective every 24 hours for 8 consecutive days. The experiment was reproduced three independent times. The focal plane was selected to be in the middle along the z-axis of the device, focusing cells completely embedded within the 3D network. The reference for the mosaics of the images was the central point of the device which was roughly given by the cross formed by the vertical line crossing the third pillar and the horizontal line dividing the central chamber. In any case, all images were automatically re-aligned through fixed reference points. Each image was then automatically analyzed with a custom-made Matlab script to count the number of cells in each channel (see Fig. 2). Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows a tiled view for different days and different conditions. These data were further analyzed to extract statistical results by means of regression models (see the Statistical modeling section).

From Soup: 26 In order to facilitate the interpretation of the results obtained in this article, we propose a chemotactic index (CI) as a phenomenological perspective. There exist a wide variety of definitions for this index in the literature, 42,54–56 however, in this work, the CI is simply defined as the difference between the estimated proportion of cells in a zone with GF and the opposite zone (where there is not any GF). Hence, we propose this definition: where i represents the channel with GF and j the opposite one.

From cou.: 28 In order to facilitate the interpretation of the results obtained in this article, we propose a chemotactic index (CI) as a phenomenological perspective. There exist a wide variety of definitions for this index in the literature,42,54–56 however, in this work, the CI is simply defined as the difference between the estimated proportion of cells in a zone with GF and the opposite zone (where there is not any GF). Hence, we propose this definition:where i represents the channel with GF and j the opposite one.
From Soup: 28 Since the initial number of cells seeded in the central chamber varies for each assay, we propose a study based on the proportion of cells in each zone. As the total sum holds (100%), we can build a statistical model that predicts the probability of cells being in a particular zone depending on the micro-environmental conditions, namely GF and collagen concentration (see Statistical modeling section). These conditions are summarized in Table 1 . Cells were tracked for each assay every 24 h over a week, including the initial state, so that time ( t ) in the model represents days and ranges from 1 to 8.

From Soup: 30 Collagen concentrations of 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 4 mg ml −1 were used to form interfaces between the microdevice hydrogel channels in a different distribution for each assay (see Table 1 ). Comparing the cell distribution evolution for the controls of each assay allows the effect of collagen concentration and step gradient direction to be isolated. The final ratio of cells in each zone was practically identical (0.24) for all assays, regardless of collagen concentration and spatial position. The temporal evolution was very similar too, if slightly slower during the first days in assay 1 (with completely uniform collagen distribution) ( Fig. 3 ). This, together with the fact that the observed minimum and maximum values of cell proportion were in the same range for all the studied cases (Fig. S6, ESI † ), suggests that the effect of collagen concentration and distribution is negligible, at least within the explored ranges. In other words, cells placed near the interfaces presented a higher probability to move towards the adjacent hydrogel, independent of its collagen concentration, than cells located in the central area of the middle channel. This implied that although cells might prefer a specific collagen concentration, the event of crossing the interface, without the influence of other cues, was purely random. To confirm this, a GAM model was proposed to evaluate the interrelation between time and cell proportion in the top and bottom zones. A nonlinear relationship, similar for each assay and zone, was found (Fig. S7, ESI † ) indicating that quadratic g i ( t ) functions should be used in the statistical model. With this idea in mind, we developed a multinomial logistic regression model to find the proportion of cells in each zone as a function of time (quadratic order), collagen concentration and step gradient with respect to the middle channel. The Wald test confirmed the non-significance of the covariates associated with collagen so that they can be safely eliminated from the equations. Hence, p 1 ( t , x i ,…, x k ) = p 3 ( t , x i ,…, x k ), which finally stands as: This equation shows the expected proportion of cells in both the top and bottom channels, which steadily increases until the 6th day and stabilizes until the 8th. Table S1 (ESI † ) summarizes the adjusted model parameters.

From Soup: 31 Based on the results obtained in previous works, 45,57 specific concentrations of PDGF and VEGF were selected (see Table 1 ) to study the influence of GFs on cell migration. Hydrogels of 2 mg ml −1 concentration of collagen were placed in the three channels to isolate the chemotactic effect. A concentration of 5 ng ml −1 PDGF was found to be the strongest chemotactic stimulus for the cells, which were attracted to the top zone (where the factor was applied) accumulating almost half of the population by the end of the assay (45%). About 15% of the cells, however, migrated toward the bottom area, and the remaining 40% stayed in the middle zone. A higher concentration of PDGF (50 ng ml −1 ) produced similar but less pronounced effects, achieving a final distribution of 31–44–25% per zone. On the other hand, the influence of VEGF was negligible compared to the control, attaining a proportion of 23–55–23%, respectively ( Fig. 4 , first row of panels).

From cou.: 32 Collagen concentrations of 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 4 mg ml−1 were used to form interfaces between the microdevice hydrogel channels in a different distribution for each assay (see Table 1). Comparing the cell distribution evolution for the controls of each assay allows the effect of collagen concentration and step gradient direction to be isolated. The final ratio of cells in each zone was practically identical (0.24) for all assays, regardless of collagen concentration and spatial position. The temporal evolution was very similar too, if slightly slower during the first days in assay 1 (with completely uniform collagen distribution) (Fig. 3). This, together with the fact that the observed minimum and maximum values of cell proportion were in the same range for all the studied cases (Fig. S6, ESI†), suggests that the effect of collagen concentration and distribution is negligible, at least within the explored ranges. In other words, cells placed near the interfaces presented a higher probability to move towards the adjacent hydrogel, independent of its collagen concentration, than cells located in the central area of the middle channel. This implied that although cells might prefer a specific collagen concentration, the event of crossing the interface, without the influence of other cues, was purely random. To confirm this, a GAM model was proposed to evaluate the interrelation between time and cell proportion in the top and bottom zones. A nonlinear relationship, similar for each assay and zone, was found (Fig. S7, ESI†) indicating that quadratic gi(t) functions should be used in the statistical model. With this idea in mind, we developed a multinomial logistic regression model to find the proportion of cells in each zone as a function of time (quadratic order), collagen concentration and step gradient with respect to the middle channel. The Wald test confirmed the non-significance of the covariates associated with collagen so that they can be safely eliminated from the equations. Hence, p1(t,xi,…,xk) = p3(t,xi,…,xk), which finally stands as:This equation shows the expected proportion of cells in both the top and bottom channels, which steadily increases until the 6th day and stabilizes until the 8th. Table S1 (ESI†) summarizes the adjusted model parameters.
From Soup: 32 Therefore, the adjusted multinomial logistic regression model for this assay includes a quadratic effect of time with equivalent coefficients for the top and bottom zones, as well as linear and quadratic effects of PDGF in the top zone (denoted [PDGF] Z1 ), while the [VEGF] Z1 effect is not significant. It is worth noting that PDGF requires a quadratic term to represent the higher attractive power of lower collagen concentration (Fig. S8, ESI † ). Adjusted parameters of the fit can be found in Table S2 (ESI † ). To obtain a better idea of the net temporal effect of each GF, it is useful to plot the ratio of cell proportion in each zone between controls and GF cases. Fig. 5 (first row) shows how the initial proportion of cells in the top zone for a PDGF concentration of 5 ng ml −1 (PDGF: 5–0) is about 2.2 times larger than the proportion of cells in such a zone for the control case. This ratio decreases in time but never goes below 1.74. Similarly, a PDGF concentration of 50 ng ml −1 in the top zone (PDGF: 50–0) presents the same effect but with lower values, reaching a maximum of 1.5 and a minimum of 1.36. The middle and bottom zones behave similarly, PDGF: 5–0, having the lower ratios.
 ###### 
From cou.: 33 Based on the results obtained in previous works,45,57 specific concentrations of PDGF and VEGF were selected (see Table 1) to study the influence of GFs on cell migration. Hydrogels of 2 mg ml−1 concentration of collagen were placed in the three channels to isolate the chemotactic effect. A concentration of 5 ng ml−1 PDGF was found to be the strongest chemotactic stimulus for the cells, which were attracted to the top zone (where the factor was applied) accumulating almost half of the population by the end of the assay (45%). About 15% of the cells, however, migrated toward the bottom area, and the remaining 40% stayed in the middle zone. A higher concentration of PDGF (50 ng ml−1) produced similar but less pronounced effects, achieving a final distribution of 31–44–25% per zone. On the other hand, the influence of VEGF was negligible compared to the control, attaining a proportion of 23–55–23%, respectively (Fig. 4, first row of panels).
From Soup: 33 Having explored the effects of GFs alone, different step gradients of collagen concentration were established to elucidate whether these new mechanical conditions in combination with the GFs were able to alter the observed individual migratory patterns. Firstly, we used a single step gradient of 1.5, 2 and 2.5 mg ml −1 collagen concentrations in the top, middle and bottom chambers, respectively, and secondly a double step gradient of 2, 1.5 and 4 mg ml −1 (see Table 1 ). In the first case (assay 2), both PDGF and VEGF were injected from both input channels separately, allowing us to study the effects of the GF gradients when applied in the same and opposite directions of the collagen concentration gradient. In assay 3, the same strategy was followed, but, based on the results of assay 2, using only PDGF.
 ###### 
From cou.: 34 Therefore, the adjusted multinomial logistic regression model for this assay includes a quadratic effect of time with equivalent coefficients for the top and bottom zones, as well as linear and quadratic effects of PDGF in the top zone (denoted [PDGF]Z1), while the [VEGF]Z1 effect is not significant. It is worth noting that PDGF requires a quadratic term to represent the higher attractive power of lower collagen concentration (Fig. S8, ESI†). Adjusted parameters of the fit can be found in Table S2 (ESI†). To obtain a better idea of the net temporal effect of each GF, it is useful to plot the ratio of cell proportion in each zone between controls and GF cases. Fig. 5 (first row) shows how the initial proportion of cells in the top zone for a PDGF concentration of 5 ng ml−1 (PDGF: 5–0) is about 2.2 times larger than the proportion of cells in such a zone for the control case. This ratio decreases in time but never goes below 1.74. Similarly, a PDGF concentration of 50 ng ml−1 in the top zone (PDGF: 50–0) presents the same effect but with lower values, reaching a maximum of 1.5 and a minimum of 1.36. The middle and bottom zones behave similarly, PDGF: 5–0, having the lower ratios.
From Soup: 34 In assay 2, we found that cell proportion evolution was, for all the cases, practically equal compared to assay 1 where the collagen concentration was homogeneous. That is, VEGF had no influence compared to the control, regardless of the input channel used, and PDGF concentrations lead to similar cell proportion values: about 40% by the end of the assay in the zone were the GF was applied and 20% in the opposite zone ( Fig. 4 second row of panels). That is to say, the collagen concentration distribution had no significant effect on cell invasion, and the top and bottom parts could be considered almost equivalent depending on the input channel used for the GF. This symmetric behavior was also observed in assay 3, where the collagen gradients were steeper and in opposite directions. However, significant variations of cell proportion (about 44% lower than controls) in the zone opposite to the corresponding input channel were observed. Although the direction of the collagen concentration gradient does not seem to affect cell migration, the magnitude of such concentration does. A possible cause of this behavior could be the greater motility of cells in 1.5 mg ml −1 collagen compared to that in 2 mg ml −1 ones, 43 explained by the differences in the structural characteristics of each collagen concentration such as the mesh size or fibril diameter. 58 Compared to assays 1 and 2, more cells in assay 3 would arrive sooner to the interface of the gel in which the GF is being liberated, activating some kind of molecular signal that could be attracting more cells from the middle zone, and decreasing the number of cells migrating towards the opposite zone. To discard some possible effects of the interfaces and the chip geometry on the GF diffusion, we quantified the diffusive profile of dextran–FITC (20 kDa). The results showed that the diffusion of particles is almost the same for both hydrogels (Fig. S9 and Video (ESI † ), gradient from the left side of the hydrogel to the right channel), explained by the difference between the particle and pore size (kDa and nm). Even though the pore size of the 4 mg ml −1 collagen hydrogel was almost half that of the 2 mg ml −1 one, 59 this reduction was not enough to decrease the particle movement in a significant way, and therefore did not affect the diffusion of GFs.

From cou.: 35 Having explored the effects of GFs alone, different step gradients of collagen concentration were established to elucidate whether these new mechanical conditions in combination with the GFs were able to alter the observed individual migratory patterns. Firstly, we used a single step gradient of 1.5, 2 and 2.5 mg ml−1 collagen concentrations in the top, middle and bottom chambers, respectively, and secondly a double step gradient of 2, 1.5 and 4 mg ml−1 (see Table 1). In the first case (assay 2), both PDGF and VEGF were injected from both input channels separately, allowing us to study the effects of the GF gradients when applied in the same and opposite directions of the collagen concentration gradient. In assay 3, the same strategy was followed, but, based on the results of assay 2, using only PDGF.
From Soup: 35 Due to these intrinsic differences, a separated multinomial logistic regression model was adjusted for each assay (Fig. S10, ESI † ). The model for assay 2 is complex and includes two linear terms to account for the concentration of PDGF in the top and bottom channels, respectively, and four quadratic terms to account for the similar but not perfectly symmetric cell proportion temporal evolution in both zones (see Table S3, ESI † ). The ratio of cell proportion in each zone between controls and cases with PDGF shows a trend practically identical to assay 1 (PDGF: 5–0) regardless of the input channel used ( Fig. 5 first and second rows), which confirms the little influence of the collagen gradient direction. Although the model for assay 3 also includes quadratic terms independent of PDGF to account for the temporal evolution, it incorporates a term representing the difference in cell proportion between the top and bottom zones, and therefore takes into account the negative effect that the PDGF has on the cell population of the opposite channel (see Table S4. ESI † ). This predicts cell proportions that are about 1.5 times larger than the control in the zone where PDGF is applied and 2 times smaller in the opposite channel ( Fig. 5 third row).

From Soup: 36 Both models were used to quantify the time at which the estimated probability reaches 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 (tp 20 , tp 30 and tp 40 ) in the top and bottom zones respectively, generating a lookup table for future studies (see Table 2 ). In control cases and in those assays with VEGF, the probability 0.2 is reached at the 5th day (tp 20 ∼ 5) whereas the probability 0.3 is never attained (and consequently neither 0.4). On the other hand, PDGF decreases the temporal threshold, achieving the probability 0.2 in the range 3–3.5 days, even reaching 0.4 around the 6th day (tp 40 ∼ 6).

From Soup: 37 Regarding the chemotactic index (CI) previously defined as the difference between the estimated proportions of cells in different zones, Table 2 shows its value on the 7th day, when a stabilized behavior of proportions has been observed in the experiments. The total time evolution of the CI can be found in Fig. S11 (ESI † ). Values close to zero appear under control conditions (with no GFs) and cases with VEGF. On the other hand, the highest values correspond to PDGF at lower doses.

From Soup: 38 In this work we have developed a microfluidic device to quantify 3D cell migration through the interface of collagen-based gels with different concentrations in the presence of different GF gradients (namely PDGF and VEGF). The simple design of this microdevice allows easy microscopy-based quantification via image processing and statistical analysis, which makes this chip a useful tool to perform 3D cell chemotaxis studies in different matrices.

From Soup: 39 The first analysis of the controls (with [PDGF] = [VEGF] = 0 ng ml −1 ) revealed that the effects of collagen concentration and collagen gradients alone do not have any influence on the distribution of cells in the three channels during the individual invasion experiment, which was only dependent (quadratic order) on time.

From Soup: 40 A second exploration using the same collagen concentration in all channels (2 mg ml −1 ) but under different GF conditions showed the strong chemo-attracting effect of PDGF at low concentrations (5 ng ml −1 ), but weaker at higher concentrations (50 ng ml −1 ). On the other hand, VEGF had no significant effect compared to controls, which was confirmed in a third analysis using both GFs and collagen concentration gradients.

From cou.: 41 The first analysis of the controls (with [PDGF] = [VEGF] = 0 ng ml−1) revealed that the effects of collagen concentration and collagen gradients alone do not have any influence on the distribution of cells in the three channels during the individual invasion experiment, which was only dependent (quadratic order) on time.
From Soup: 41 Another third assay was performed to elucidate the role of collagen step gradients. The results suggest that the step collagen gradient direction itself has no direct effect on cell migration, although the magnitude of the concentration might still influence cell behavior. In fact, when the collagen step gradient is from 1.5 to 2.5 the role of the chemoattractant is similar to the case with uniform collagen density. However, if the gradient is not defined but the collagen concentration is varied (2–1.5–4) significant negative effects (decreased cell population) were found in the channel opposite to the GF addition. Whether this is produced by some interaction between the GF and the collagen density, it is just a random process depending on the cell proximity to the interfaces, or it relies on some mechano-transduction signaling between the cells arriving at the interfaces and those still placed in the seeding zone is out of the scope of this work and will be explored in future studies.

On the other hand, VEGF had no significant effect compared to controls, which was confirmed in a third analysis using both GFs and collagen concentration gradients.
From Soup: 42 To assess the reliability of our experiments, we have developed a wide statistical analysis. In fact, experimental data were adjusted to different multinomial logistic regression models to elucidate the contribution and interactions between the involved variables, particularly: time, collagen concentration magnitude, collagen concentration distribution (gradient) and GF concentration. This kind of statistical modeling presents several advantages: (a) it simultaneously represents the temporal evolution of the ratio of cells in the three zones, (b) the model is multivariate and includes the ability to estimate the effect of one or more potential stimuli, whose statistical significance is established by the test ( e.g. study the effect of GF present in both channels simultaneously), (c) the shape of GF effects or time evolution can be expressed, using adequate functions to include non-linear effects (for instance, the expected time to reach a given proportion in a certain area with GF can be easily obtained from the statistical model), and (d) the model can be used, without the necessity of performing new experiments, to estimate the migration response in different combinations of the considered stimuli, provided the desired GF doses fall within the current range. Apart from that, there are other advantages compared to other more commonly used methods such as the chemotactic index, including the necessity of significantly less time points for cell imaging and cell tracking measurements. However, it also has disadvantages. For example, the model could find significant statistical associations but does not necessarily imply a cause–effect relationship, which should be established based on biological arguments and the adequate design of experiments.

From Soup: 43 From our study, we conclude that our microfluidic device allows 3D chemotaxis measurements for human cells through the interface of different collagen-based hydrogels to be performed for the first time. This new device can provide the basis for developing a platform for the chemotactic analysis of multiple interfaces between different biomaterials. In addition, our device can be easily extended to include more chambers, therefore increasing the number of possible conditions. This will allow cell migration to be tested towards specific chemo-attractants in order to characterize cell capacity to move from one matrix to another, significantly improving our understanding of how cell movement is regulated by chemotaxis and the different properties of the extracellular matrix. It is worth noting that the control over the interface formation is limited, and that some variations may arise due to the manual procedure used to insert the hydrogels into the corresponding chambers. Nevertheless, we did not observe high variability during the experiments, with cells showing a clear spatial independent pattern in their invasion from the central chamber.
