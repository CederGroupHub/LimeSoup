From cou.: 1 Recently, we devised an energy scale to vary systematically amino acid–solvent interactions for Monte Carlo simulations of lattice model proteins in water. For 27-mer and 64-mer protein chains, changes in the interaction energies produce quite different protein-folding behavior. Here, for two- to six-chain systems, we investigate the effect of interaction parameters and chain length on protein aggregation. Here too, small changes in the interaction energies produce different classes of protein behavior: non-aggregating; reversibly aggregating; irreversibly aggregating while maintaining part or all of the native structure. Interaction parameters optimized for fast folding and high cooperativity in single-chain simulations provide the least aggregation in multi-chain simulations. Simulations with 27-mers and with 64-mers suggest that the interaction-energy parameters optimal for stability against aggregation depend only weakly on protein size. Although we are not able to find an energy parameter set for 27-mers that makes the native, non-aggregating state the most stable state, we have obtained such a set of parameters for 64-mers, indicating a strong influence of chain length on aggregation properties.

From cou.: 2 The biological function of a protein is coupled strongly to its conformation or tertiary structure. For native proteins, this conformation is believed to correspond to the global minimum of free energy.1–3 The order of free-energy levels of different conformations can change in the presence of other molecules (macromolecules like chaperones or amyloids or small molecules like urea or sugars) and in the presence of interfaces.4,5 A change in conformation usually diminishes the biological function of a protein and may lead to precipitation.3 Conformation change is relevant for the production,6 formulation and application7 of protein-containing drugs and nutrition supplements. Aggregation also plays a crucial role in several diseases, including Alzheimer’s2,8–12 and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)/scrapie.13–15 Despite the importance of protein aggregation, much remains to be learned.

From cou.: 3 A number of protein aggregation studies using lattice Monte Carlo simulations have appeared in the literature. Beyond the simplifications resulting from the lattice representation itself, all of the interaction-energy models used have several shortcomings. Two studies by Bratko et al.16,17 are based on the Go model,18 where two amino acid beads interact with energy −ε if they are in contact in the native state; otherwise the interaction energy is zero. Although the Go model is probably the simplest possible model for protein simulation, it is nevertheless known to capture the generic features of protein folding and aggregation. However, in an N-bead Go model, each bead is unique and attracts only those beads that are neighboring it in the native state. Therefore, it is an N-letter model with a very high specificity. In a Go-model protein, more different types of amino acids exist than in nature. One might argue that the relatively high stability of Go-proteins against aggregation might be due to the higher-than-natural specificity. Bratko et al. found in their more recent study that an increase in the size of a Go-model protein increases the stability against aggregation of the chain.

From cou.: 4 Another model used for aggregation studies is the HP model.19–21 In the HP model, there are two different kinds of amino acid beads: hydrophobic and polar. The HP model can describe generic features as the Go model. However, it lacks different strengths of hydrophobicity and specific interactions between specific pairs of amino acids. A model introduced by Miyazawa and Jernigan (MJ model)22 has the advantage of providing experimentally approximated interaction energies for all 20 amino acids, allowing for different degrees of hydrophobicity and polarity and specific amino-acid interactions. For example, the self interaction of charged amino acids is very weak, but oppositely-charged amino acids attract each other strongly. However, Miyazawa and Jernigan point out22 that the amino-acid hydrophobicity in their model is about twice as large as that in most other publications. Further, for two 36-mers in water, Broglia et al.23 using the MJ model, observed that irreversible aggregation occurs for all amino-acid sequences studied whenever two strongly attractive sites of the stable cores of the chains come into contact during the folding process. However, in nature, this irreversible aggregation seems to be the exception rather than the rule for proteins under physiological conditions.24

From cou.: 6 Our interaction model is an extension of the MJ interaction-energy scale. The modified interaction-energy scale allows us, by changing one parameter, , to alter the trend of our lattice proteins to prefer compact structures. In addition, with a second parameter, Cs, our interaction energy scale permits adjustment of the difference between two interaction energies, viz the interaction energy between a hydrophobic amino acid and the solvent and the interaction energy between a hydrophilic amino acid and the solvent. In other words, we can vary the amino acid–solvent interactions independently from the amino acid–amino acid interactions, which we take from Miyazawa and Jernigan.22 Accordingly, we can change the relative strength of the hydrophobicity of the amino acids and the contrast of their hydrophobicity compared to the specific amino acid–amino acid interactions. Using these two parameters, we can design solvents of different polarity, study protein folding and aggregation in these solvents, and then, upon comparing with experimentally observed behavior for aqueous protein solutions, decide which of them is most conducive to realistic protein behavior.

The more positive Cs, the more favorable are contacts between the solvent and hydrophilic amino acids. describes the average interaction of an amino acid with the solvent. When is negative, amino acid–solvent interactions are attractive on average. When is positive, amino acids repel the solvent and hence effectively attract each other.

 ###### 
From cou.: 29 E
From Soup: 29 During the simulation, we compute and record different types of contacts in addition to the energy. The number of total contacts, N tot , is the number of contacts between the beads of one chain and all other amino-acid beads on any chain, omitting contacts between the two neighbors that are consecutive on the same chain (one neighbor for a terminal bead). A contact between two beads exists if the beads are nearest neighbors on the lattice. The number of intramolecular contacts, N intra , refers only to contacts between non-consecutive beads on the same chain, and the number of intermolecular contacts, N inter , refers the contacts between beads of two different chains: N inter + N intra = N tot . The number of native contacts, N nat , refers to those contacts that are also present in the maximally compact state ( i.e. , a 3 × 3 × 3 or 4 × 4 × 4 cube). N nat is a commonly used measure of the similarity of a given structure to the native structure. Note in our work that the native state is not necessarily a maximally compact state but may be an ensemble of rather compact and structurally closely related states. Therefore, N nat of a native state is not necessarily the same as the maximal possible number of native contacts, N nat,max . 25,26,29 The number of total contacts gives information on how compact a protein is under given conditions, similar to the radius of gyration but in an inverse scale. The number of intermolecular contacts is useful for determining how strongly chains aggregate in multiple-chain simulations.

From Soup: 31 Protein -like polymers exhibit a folding transition: they are unfolded at high temperatures and folded at low temperatures. The midpoint temperature T m is defined as the temperature where, on average, half of the native contacts are present during a simulation. For a 27-mer with a 3 × 3 × 3 cube as native state having 28 native contacts, T m is the temperature where 〈 N nat, max 〉= 14.

The number of intermolecular contacts is useful for determining how strongly chains aggregate in multiple-chain simulations.
From Soup: 33 Usually, there is a free-energy barrier between the folded and the unfolded states that determines the folding rate of the chain. Small free-energy barriers characterize well-designed proteins . However, for certain combinations of chain sequence and interaction-energy scale, the free-energy barrier can be much larger than the free-energy difference between the folded and the unfolded state. An example is provided by Fig. 1 , which graphs the free energy as a function of N nat for a 27-mer. In this example, the folded state (II) is the stable state and the unfolded (I), is a metastable state. If a simulation at a low temperature is started in the native state of Fig. 1 , the chain remains there over the time scale of the simulation. Likewise, if the simulation is started in an unfolded state, it remains trapped in a metastable configuration. In multi-chain simulations, a multitude of metastable states exists at a low temperature, and the system is also considered to be in a glass-like state. If the temperature is increased sufficiently, the simulation starts to sample all relevant states. The temperature where this statistically meaningful sampling occurs is called the glass-transition temperature, T g . As an estimate of T g , we use the highest temperature where 2 × 10 10 MC steps are not sufficient to sample all metastable states. The blocking algorithm of Flyvbjerg and Petersen 28 estimates the sampling statistical errors and assesses when sampling becomes insufficient. Clearly, this definition does not correspond to a definition on macroscopic time scales, but to the time scales accessible to our simulations. Nevertheless T g should be useful for comparing results for different interaction-energy scales. For well-designed proteins , the glass-transition temperature is much lower than the midpoint temperature. However, for aggregation simulations with multiple chains, T g is typically in the region 0.75 < T g / T m < 1.1 and becomes an important parameter that diagnoses whether reversible aggregation takes place or whether the chains form amorphous, irreversible aggregates.

From cou.: 35 Protein-like polymers exhibit a folding transition: they are unfolded at high temperatures and folded at low temperatures. The midpoint temperature Tm is defined as the temperature where, on average, half of the native contacts are present during a simulation. For a 27-mer with a 3×3×3 cube as native state having 28 native contacts, Tm is the temperature where 〈Nnat, max〉=14. For a 64-mer, the native state has 81 contacts and Tm corresponds to 〈Nnat, max〉=40.5.
From Soup: 35 Several definitions of cooperativity are discussed by Crippen and Chhajer. 29 We use a simple definition where the cooperativity, Δ T / T m , is calculated from the temperatures where on average 0.9, 0.5 and 0.1 times the maximum number of native contacts can be observed: 25,26

Small free-energy barriers characterize well-designed proteins. However, for certain combinations of chain sequence and interaction-energy scale, the free-energy barrier can be much larger than the free-energy difference between the folded and the unfolded state.

In this example, the folded state (II) is the stable state and the unfolded (I), is a metastable state. If a simulation at a low temperature is started in the native state of Fig. 1, the chain remains there over the time scale of the simulation. Likewise, if the simulation is started in an unfolded state, it remains trapped in a metastable configuration. In multi-chain simulations, a multitude of metastable states exists at a low temperature, and the system is also considered to be in a glass-like state. If the temperature is increased sufficiently, the simulation starts to sample all relevant states. The temperature where this statistically meaningful sampling occurs is called the glass-transition temperature, Tg. As an estimate of Tg, we use the highest temperature where 2×1010 MC steps are not sufficient to sample all metastable states.

For well-designed proteins, the glass-transition temperature is much lower than the midpoint temperature.

From cou.: 38 Cooperativity.
From Soup: 38 Because of the importance of folding speed for proteins , we also determine the folding time in our simulations. During the simulation, we record when a chain changes from a completely folded state to one with less than 40% (25% for 64-mers) of its native contacts present, or vice versa , independently of the number of inter-chain contacts. The average number of MC steps performed for one folding/unfolding cycle is referred to as the mean folding time t f .

 ###### 
From cou.: 40 A low value of ΔT/Tm corresponds to a high cooperativity and vice versa.
From Soup: 40 In a Monte Carlo simulation, it is not possible to calculate absolute free energies. However, it is possible to calculate free-energy differences between states that can be observed in MC simulations by counting the numbers of occurrences of the states. We use the number of native contacts, N nat , and the number of intermolecular contacts, N inter , which are called order parameters, to create a 2-dimensional histogram for each chain in a simulation; we then count how often the chain is in each state corresponding to a combination of the two order parameters. In the calculation, we set the free energy of the fully folded single chain ( N nat = 28) equal to zero. After the simulation, the relative free energy F (A) of state A is calculated from the number of times the chain was found in that state Z (A). where Z (A) is the canonical partition sum of the system in state A. It is composed of the configurational part of the partition sum, Z conf , and the translational part, Z trans . For a box length of L , Z trans = 6 L 3 or, equivalently, F trans / k B T = −10.78 (with L = 20) per free object. A single isolated chain is a free object as is an aggregated multiple-chain. As listed in Tables 5 and 8 below, reported free energies correspond to the particular concentrations employed here; they can be converted to different concentrations ( i.e. , to different box sizes) by the formula given above for the translational partition function. Calculated free energies preserve their trends with interaction energy parameters independent of concentration (or box size).
 ###### 
From cou.: 41 Folding time.
From Soup: 41 The state A can be a histogram bin. It can also be any combination of histogram bins. For example, for the four states in multi-chain aggregation simulations defined in the results section, each bin of the histogram is added to one of the four states, depending on the respective values of N nat and N inter .

From cou.: 42 Because of the importance of folding speed for proteins, we also determine the folding time in our simulations. During the simulation, we record when a chain changes from a completely folded state to one with less than 40% (25% for 64-mers) of its native contacts present, or vice versa, independently of the number of inter-chain contacts. The average number of MC steps performed for one folding/unfolding cycle is referred to as the mean folding time tf.
From Soup: 42 A series of simulations with two identical 27-mers in bulk water was performed for C s = 0.2 and for several values of . The goal is to elucidate the effects of single-chain properties on aggregation behavior, namely folding speed to the native state and cooperativity for a single chain. For each interaction energy scale, we performed simulations at several temperatures to analyze the effect of temperature as well as the effect of the interaction-energy parameters. First, we enumerate in Fig. 2 the four basic configuration ensembles a chain can display in a multi-chain simulation: (A) separated and folded to the native state; (B) separated and unfolded; (C) aggregated in the native state; and (D) aggregated in the unfolded state. For the aggregated, folded and aggregated, unfolded states, we do not distinguish whether an aggregate is a dimer, a trimer, and so on, but only whether or not it is a single chain or an aggregate of two or more chains. Unless the temperature is low enough to reach the glass-like state (details given below), all four conformation ensembles appear in all simulations, but with different free energies.

Calculated free energies preserve their trends with interaction energy parameters independent of concentration (or box size).
From Soup: 44 Fig. 2A illustrates two separated chains that are folded in their native states. The separated state is characterized, of course, by having no intermolecular contacts, N inter = 0. The number of native contacts in the separated and native state is the same as that for a single chain in the native state. Since we have previously identified two different classes of native states, viz maximally compact native states and non-compact native states, 25,26 it is useful to make the same distinction here. In the simulations with C s = 0.2 and = 0.01, the native state (or lowest energy state) of the single 27-mer chain is non-compact, has 23 of the native contacts in the compact state and has 26 total contacts. This particular conformation is pictured elsewhere ( cf. Fig. 4 of ref. 25 ). For all other parameter sets in the multi-chain simulations, the native state is a compact one like those shown in Fig. 2A .

From cou.: 45 The state A can be a histogram bin. It can also be any combination of histogram bins. For example, for the four states in multi-chain aggregation simulations defined in the results section, each bin of the histogram is added to one of the four states, depending on the respective values of Nnat and Ninter.

From cou.: 46 A series of simulations with two identical 27-mers in bulk water was performed for Cs=0.2 and for several values of . The goal is to elucidate the effects of single-chain properties on aggregation behavior, namely folding speed to the native state and cooperativity for a single chain. For each interaction energy scale, we performed simulations at several temperatures to analyze the effect of temperature as well as the effect of the interaction-energy parameters. First, we enumerate in Fig. 2 the four basic configuration ensembles a chain can display in a multi-chain simulation: (A) separated and folded to the native state; (B) separated and unfolded; (C) aggregated in the native state; and (D) aggregated in the unfolded state. For the aggregated, folded and aggregated, unfolded states, we do not distinguish whether an aggregate is a dimer, a trimer, and so on, but only whether or not it is a single chain or an aggregate of two or more chains. Unless the temperature is low enough to reach the glass-like state (details given below), all four conformation ensembles appear in all simulations, but with different free energies.
From Soup: 46 The separated, unfolded state is shown in Fig. 2B . Here, again, N inter is zero. Since Fig. 2B shows a configuration in a simulation at a relatively low temperature ( T ≈ 0.8 T m ), the unfolded states are rather compact. At higher temperatures, the unfolded states are less compact, have fewer intraprotein contacts, N intra , and a higher radius of gyration ( i.e. a smaller N tot ).

From cou.: 47 Separated and native.
From Soup: 47 Aggregated and native.
 ###### 
From cou.: 48 Fig. 2A illustrates two separated chains that are folded in their native states. The separated state is characterized, of course, by having no intermolecular contacts, Ninter=0. The number of native contacts in the separated and native state is the same as that for a single chain in the native state. Since we have previously identified two different classes of native states, viz maximally compact native states and non-compact native states,25,26 it is useful to make the same distinction here. In the simulations with Cs=0.2 and =0.01, the native state (or lowest energy state) of the single 27-mer chain is non-compact, has 23 of the native contacts in the compact state and has 26 total contacts. This particular conformation is pictured elsewhere (cf. Fig. 4 of ref. 25). For all other parameter sets in the multi-chain simulations, the native state is a compact one like those shown in Fig. 2A.
From Soup: 48 The aggregated and native state is also found subdivided into two substates. For those 27-mers with a maximally compact native state, N nat = 28 per chain, and N inter > 0 defines the aggregated and native state. For interaction-energy parameter sets with a non-compact native state ( i.e. C s = 0.2 and = 0.01), N nat has to be 23 per chain or larger and N inter > 0 to be considered aggregated and native. In all 2-chain simulations performed with 27-mers, the natively aggregated state was the lowest energy state found during the simulations. This state is shown in Fig. 2C for simulations with C s = 0.2 and > 0.1 ( N nat = 28, N intra = 28, and N inter = 6). For C s = 0.2 and = 0.01, the state with the lowest energy found in our simulations is one with 26 native contacts per chain ( i.e. three more than in a single-chain simulation), 26 intra-chain contacts, and 6 inter-chain contacts. This configuration is shown in Fig. 3 where dashed lines indicate the amino-acid residue intermolecular contacts.

 ###### 
From cou.: 50 The separated, unfolded state is shown in Fig. 2B. Here, again, Ninter is zero. Since Fig. 2B shows a configuration in a simulation at a relatively low temperature (T≈0.8Tm), the unfolded states are rather compact. At higher temperatures, the unfolded states are less compact, have fewer intraprotein contacts, Nintra, and a higher radius of gyration (i.e. a smaller Ntot).
From Soup: 50 In the aggregated and unfolded conformation ensemble, N inter > 0, and the number of native contacts is smaller than that in the native state. Fig. 2D shows an example for two chains aggregated in the unfolded state. The aggregated and unfolded state exhibits a large range of the number of native contacts, depending on the particle interaction energy-parameter set employed and on the temperature. The number of intermolecular contacts and the compactness of the chains also vary strongly with the interaction-energy scale and the temperature.

 ###### 
From cou.: 52 The aggregated and native state is also found subdivided into two substates. For those 27-mers with a maximally compact native state, Nnat=28 per chain, and Ninter>0 defines the aggregated and native state. For interaction-energy parameter sets with a non-compact native state (i.e.Cs=0.2 and =0.01), Nnat has to be 23 per chain or larger and Ninter>0 to be considered aggregated and native. In all 2-chain simulations performed with 27-mers, the natively aggregated state was the lowest energy state found during the simulations. This state is shown in Fig. 2C for simulations with Cs=0.2 and >0.1 (Nnat=28, Nintra=28, and Ninter=6). For Cs=0.2 and =0.01, the state with the lowest energy found in our simulations is one with 26 native contacts per chain (i.e. three more than in a single-chain simulation), 26 intra-chain contacts, and 6 inter-chain contacts. This configuration is shown in Fig. 3 where dashed lines indicate the amino-acid residue intermolecular contacts.
From Soup: 52 All frames from Fig. 2 are snapshots from a single simulation. However, because the frames in Fig. 2 are arranged in a sequence that is most logical to explain the four states, they do not appear in the same time sequence as that of the simulation. The particular simulation of Fig. 2 started in the configuration of frame A with each chain in its native state, one lattice site apart. Next image D appears where both chains eliminate their native structure to a large extent and many intermolecular contacts arise. From this unfolded aggregate, the chains are able to separate and refold again to their native configuration in frame C, but they completely lose ’memory’ of their previous orientation. During the particular low-temperature simulation at T = 0.805 T m in Fig. 2 , the last observed state is the separated, unfolded state B. The system moves many times through all four states during the simulation; hence aggregation is completely reversible at this temperature.

From Soup: 53 Effect of temperature and mean attraction.
 ###### 
From cou.: 54 In the aggregated and unfolded conformation ensemble, Ninter>0, and the number of native contacts is smaller than that in the native state. Fig. 2D shows an example for two chains aggregated in the unfolded state. The aggregated and unfolded state exhibits a large range of the number of native contacts, depending on the particle interaction energy-parameter set employed and on the temperature. The number of intermolecular contacts and the compactness of the chains also vary strongly with the interaction-energy scale and the temperature.
From Soup: 54 A series of two- protein simulations was performed starting at the midpoint temperature T m , and then lowering the temperature as much as possible ( e.g. , 0.9 T m , 0.85 T m and 0.8 T m ). To both illustrate the temperature trend on aggregation and to keep the amount of data shown manageable, we report here the results only for two temperatures, T m and 0.85 T m , in Tables 2 and 3 , respectively. Single-chain simulation results for 27-mers under the same conditions are shown in Table 4 .
 ###### 
From cou.: 55 Progression of a 2-chain simulation.
From Soup: 55 At T m in Table 2 and for a weak mean attraction ( ≤ 0.2), the number of native contacts per chain in the 2-chain system is close to the number of native contacts in the single-chain system (〈 N nat 〉= 14 at T m by definition). This number decreases monotonicaly as increases, whereas the number of total contacts and, much more pronounced, the folding time, increase. For a weak mean attraction, states B and D appear most frequently during a simulation at T m , while state D becomes the strongly dominating state when the mean attraction is stronger (see Table 5 ). These four trends together indicate that inter-chain aggregation is stronger the stronger is the mean attraction.
 ###### 
From cou.: 56 All frames from Fig. 2 are snapshots from a single simulation. However, because the frames in Fig. 2 are arranged in a sequence that is most logical to explain the four states, they do not appear in the same time sequence as that of the simulation. The particular simulation of Fig. 2 started in the configuration of frame A with each chain in its native state, one lattice site apart. Next image D appears where both chains eliminate their native structure to a large extent and many intermolecular contacts arise. From this unfolded aggregate, the chains are able to separate and refold again to their native configuration in frame C, but they completely lose ’memory’ of their previous orientation. During the particular low-temperature simulation at T=0.805Tm in Fig. 2, the last observed state is the separated, unfolded state B. The system moves many times through all four states during the simulation; hence aggregation is completely reversible at this temperature.
From Soup: 56 However, there is another effect that plays a role at lower temperatures and causes a maximum of native structure at intermediate mean attractions. As shown in Table 3 , for a very weak mean attraction ( = 0.01), the number of native contacts increases minimally when the temperature is reduced. For = 0.01 the most stable low-temperature single-chain state is one with only 23 native contacts. Although the number of native contacts in the 2-chain system is close to 〈 N nat 〉 in the single-chain system under these conditions, the number of native contacts is not maximal. At a high mean attraction and at T = 0.85 T m , there is again much more aggregation than at a weak mean attraction. This difference in aggregation strength between low and high mean attraction holds for T m (data in Table 2 ) as well as for lower temperatures ( i.e. for T = 0.85 T m in Table 3 and for temperatures where no data are shown). Because of the strong aggregation at a high mean attraction and because of the relatively few native contacts in a single chain simulation at a very weak mean attraction, the native structure is preserved to the greatest extent at = 0.16. This information can be obtained from the trends in Tables 2, 3 and 4 . All conformations that play a role in this context belong to the strongly variant states B and D in Fig. 2 .
 ###### 
From cou.: 57 Effect of temperature and mean attraction.
From Soup: 57 If the temperature is further reduced to 0.8 T m , the trend of increasing aggregation for all but the smallest continues, but very long simulations are necessary to obtain reliable results, especially when > 0.3. Under conditions of strong mean attraction and at T = 0.8 T m , a glass-like state is reached. We can, therefore, estimate that the glass-transition temperature T g lies between 0.85 T m and 0.8 T m for > 0.3. For weaker mean attractions, simulations are possible at slightly lower temperatures (0.75 T m < T g < 0.8 T m ). In any case, glass-like states are reached before the global energy minimum is the dominant state indicating that a simulation started in an arbitrary conformation usually does not reach the lowest-energy state at low temperatures. Instead, the system is trapped in a local free-energy minimum of two aggregated unfolded chains, although the system can visit the lowest energy state at moderately higher temperatures. The trapped aggregate looks much like structure D in Fig. 2 , but now the aggregate is essentially irreversible. Therefore, the lowest-energy structure C of Fig. 2 occurs only at temperatures T m or slightly below, but not at very low temperatures, if > 0.3. This result shows that there is a high free-energy barrier for the reorientation from structure A to structure C in Fig. 2 under low-temperature conditions. The free-energy barrier between structures A and C provides further indication for the existence of metastable states at low temperature and strong mean attractions. If a simulation at 0.8 T m is started in the lowest energy state with a high mean attraction, the chains remain close to this state throughout the entire simulation.
 ###### 
From cou.: 58 A series of two-protein simulations was performed starting at the midpoint temperature Tm, and then lowering the temperature as much as possible (e.g., 0.9Tm, 0.85Tm and 0.8Tm). To both illustrate the temperature trend on aggregation and to keep the amount of data shown manageable, we report here the results only for two temperatures, Tm and 0.85Tm, in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Single-chain simulation results for 27-mers under the same conditions are shown in Table 4.
From Soup: 58 Free-energy differences between the four aggregation states.
 ###### 
From cou.: 59 At Tm in Table 2 and for a weak mean attraction (≤0.2), the number of native contacts per chain in the 2-chain system is close to the number of native contacts in the single-chain system (〈Nnat〉=14 at Tm by definition). This number decreases monotonicaly as increases, whereas the number of total contacts and, much more pronounced, the folding time, increase. For a weak mean attraction, states B and D appear most frequently during a simulation at Tm, while state D becomes the strongly dominating state when the mean attraction is stronger (see Table 5). These four trends together indicate that inter-chain aggregation is stronger the stronger is the mean attraction.
From Soup: 59 Unexpectedly, for 27-mers, we did not find an interaction-energy parameter set of and C s wherein the free folded chains are the primary state as indicated in the free-energy differences between the four states shown in Table 5 . With increasing mean attraction, the stability of the separated, unfolded state decreases whereas the stability of both aggregated states increases. Decreasing the temperature always favors folded states: both the aggregated and separated. For a low mean attraction ( = 0.01), the separated, unfolded state is dominant when T > T g . For the next stronger mean attraction, = 0.11, the separated, unfolded state is only the most stable at T = T m , but not at any lower temperature studied. At any temperature above the glass-transition temperature, the aggregated, unfolded state is always more stable than the aggregated folded state. Therefore, for a high mean attraction larger than approximately 0.11, the chains are found mostly in the aggregated, unfolded state. When the temperature is lowered, the two unfolded states are always less populated, and the folded states become more stable. However, as mentioned before, the glass-like state is reached before the most stable, natively aggregated state is dominant for any interaction-energy parameter set.
 ###### 
From cou.: 60 However, there is another effect that plays a role at lower temperatures and causes a maximum of native structure at intermediate mean attractions. As shown in Table 3, for a very weak mean attraction (=0.01), the number of native contacts increases minimally when the temperature is reduced. For =0.01 the most stable low-temperature single-chain state is one with only 23 native contacts. Although the number of native contacts in the 2-chain system is close to 〈Nnat〉 in the single-chain system under these conditions, the number of native contacts is not maximal. At a high mean attraction and at T=0.85Tm, there is again much more aggregation than at a weak mean attraction. This difference in aggregation strength between low and high mean attraction holds for Tm (data in Table 2) as well as for lower temperatures (i.e. for T=0.85Tm in Table 3 and for temperatures where no data are shown). Because of the strong aggregation at a high mean attraction and because of the relatively few native contacts in a single chain simulation at a very weak mean attraction, the native structure is preserved to the greatest extent at =0.16. This information can be obtained from the trends in Tables 2, 3 and 4. All conformations that play a role in this context belong to the strongly variant states B and D in Fig. 2.
From Soup: 60 We have also evaluated the effect of a definition of the native state based on only 23 native contacts, as suggested by our single-chain results 25 and as suggested by Crippen et. al. . 29 Using N nat ≥ 23 instead of N nat = 28 as the definition of the native state, the free energy of the folded state is obviously reduced, but the results do not change qualitatively. However, this observation for 27-mer chains does not hold for 64-mer chains.
 ###### 
From cou.: 61 If the temperature is further reduced to 0.8Tm, the trend of increasing aggregation for all but the smallest continues, but very long simulations are necessary to obtain reliable results, especially when >0.3. Under conditions of strong mean attraction and at T=0.8Tm, a glass-like state is reached. We can, therefore, estimate that the glass-transition temperature Tg lies between 0.85Tm and 0.8Tm for >0.3. For weaker mean attractions, simulations are possible at slightly lower temperatures (0.75Tm<Tg<0.8Tm). In any case, glass-like states are reached before the global energy minimum is the dominant state indicating that a simulation started in an arbitrary conformation usually does not reach the lowest-energy state at low temperatures. Instead, the system is trapped in a local free-energy minimum of two aggregated unfolded chains, although the system can visit the lowest energy state at moderately higher temperatures. The trapped aggregate looks much like structure D in Fig. 2, but now the aggregate is essentially irreversible. Therefore, the lowest-energy structure C of Fig. 2 occurs only at temperatures Tm or slightly below, but not at very low temperatures, if >0.3. This result shows that there is a high free-energy barrier for the reorientation from structure A to structure C in Fig. 2 under low-temperature conditions. The free-energy barrier between structures A and C provides further indication for the existence of metastable states at low temperature and strong mean attractions. If a simulation at 0.8Tm is started in the lowest energy state with a high mean attraction, the chains remain close to this state throughout the entire simulation.
From Soup: 61 In addition to the series of simulations at C s = 0.2, we performed simulations with C s = 0.1 and C s = 0.4 to check whether there is an unexpected effect of the contrast parameter. We use mean attractions = 0.06 and = 0.42, respectively, because they feature the fastest folding for the contrast parameters C s = 0.1 and C s = 0.4. Nevertheless, for single-chain simulations with these two parameter sets, folding speed is slower and cooperativity weaker than for C s = 0.2 and = 0.16. The simulations with C s = 0.4 show a very strong aggregation behavior, while the results for C s = 0.1 indicate only slightly more aggregation than that for the best sets with C s = 0.2. This behavior correlates well with the folding rates and cooperativity obtained for a single chain.

From cou.: 62 Free-energy differences between the four aggregation states.
From Soup: 62 Aggregation behavior of more than two chains has been sparsely studied. Using the Go potential, Bratko and Blanch 16,17 found that two 27-mers aggregate reversibly, but more than two aggregate irreversibly. To investigate the behavior of more than two chains with our interaction-energy scale, we performed simulations with three, four, and six chains. For the multi-chain simulations, we calculated the same quantities as we did for the two-chain simulations. We present our results in terms of the same four states described in the previous section and shown in Fig. 2 .
 ###### 
From cou.: 63 Unexpectedly, for 27-mers, we did not find an interaction-energy parameter set of and Cs wherein the free folded chains are the primary state as indicated in the free-energy differences between the four states shown in Table 5. With increasing mean attraction, the stability of the separated, unfolded state decreases whereas the stability of both aggregated states increases. Decreasing the temperature always favors folded states: both the aggregated and separated. For a low mean attraction (=0.01), the separated, unfolded state is dominant when T>Tg. For the next stronger mean attraction, =0.11, the separated, unfolded state is only the most stable at T=Tm, but not at any lower temperature studied. At any temperature above the glass-transition temperature, the aggregated, unfolded state is always more stable than the aggregated folded state. Therefore, for a high mean attraction larger than approximately 0.11, the chains are found mostly in the aggregated, unfolded state. When the temperature is lowered, the two unfolded states are always less populated, and the folded states become more stable. However, as mentioned before, the glass-like state is reached before the most stable, natively aggregated state is dominant for any interaction-energy parameter set.
From Soup: 63 Very long simulations (more than 5 × 10 10 MC steps) are necessary to obtain a stationary state in multi-chain simulations. Nevertheless, for many of the conditions studied, the results for different copies of chains of the same kind in a simulation do not agree well, although they should agree if the phase space is thoroughly sampled. Therefore, we do not present any numbers, but only trends that can be identified from our simulations.
 ###### 
From cou.: 64 We have also evaluated the effect of a definition of the native state based on only 23 native contacts, as suggested by our single-chain results25 and as suggested by Crippen et. al..29 Using Nnat≥23 instead of Nnat=28 as the definition of the native state, the free energy of the folded state is obviously reduced, but the results do not change qualitatively. However, this observation for 27-mer chains does not hold for 64-mer chains.
From Soup: 64 In general, the higher the chain concentration, the more aggregation occurs, indicating fewer native contacts, more inter-chain contacts and a lower free energy of the aggregated structures. This trend is relatively weak for a weak mean attraction ( = 0.01) and more pronounced for a moderate to strong mean attraction.
 ###### 
From cou.: 65 In addition to the series of simulations at Cs=0.2, we performed simulations with Cs=0.1 and Cs=0.4 to check whether there is an unexpected effect of the contrast parameter. We use mean attractions =0.06 and =0.42, respectively, because they feature the fastest folding for the contrast parameters Cs=0.1 and Cs=0.4. Nevertheless, for single-chain simulations with these two parameter sets, folding speed is slower and cooperativity weaker than for Cs=0.2 and =0.16. The simulations with Cs=0.4 show a very strong aggregation behavior, while the results for Cs=0.1 indicate only slightly more aggregation than that for the best sets with Cs=0.2. This behavior correlates well with the folding rates and cooperativity obtained for a single chain.
From Soup: 65 When more chains are present in a simulation, the temperature of the transition to the glass-like state, where the phase space cannot be sampled completely, is shifted to a higher temperature. Although this temperature is below the midpoint temperature for all 2-chain simulations, it is about at the midpoint temperature for a strong mean attraction for the three-chain simulations and even higher for simulations with more chains. For a weak mean attraction, the transition occurs always at a temperature slightly below that for a high mean attraction, but rises above the midpoint temperature for a high concentration.
 ###### 
From cou.: 66 Aggregation behavior of more than two chains has been sparsely studied. Using the Go potential, Bratko and Blanch16,17 found that two 27-mers aggregate reversibly, but more than two aggregate irreversibly. To investigate the behavior of more than two chains with our interaction-energy scale, we performed simulations with three, four, and six chains. For the multi-chain simulations, we calculated the same quantities as we did for the two-chain simulations. We present our results in terms of the same four states described in the previous section and shown in Fig. 2.
From Soup: 66 Previously, we established that 64-mers with our energy scale show more realistic behavior than do 27-mers. 26 Therefore, it is useful to study the aggregation of 64-mer chains. Again, we present our results for two 64-mers in water using the same four aggregation states of Fig. 2 . The progression of a simulation of two 64-mers is similar to that with two 27-mers. However, the degree of remaining native structure for the aggregation simulations with 64-mers can be quite different from the results for 27-mers, depending on temperature. Calculated results are shown in Table 6 . The number of total contacts, folding time, and cooperativity can be compared with 64-mer single-chain results in Table 7 . The results can also be compared with the aggregation results for two 27-mers in Tables 2 and 3 . At the midpoint temperature, the general observations do not differ much from those for two 27-mers. For a weak mean attraction, the number of native contacts is close to the results for single-chain simulations; when increases, only a few native contacts remain. At T m , similar to the 27-mer, states B and/or D in Fig. 2 dominate for all mean attractions studied. However, for a weak mean attraction the sructures are close to the native conformation. When the temperature is lowered, the quantitative behavior of two 64-mers is considerably different from two 27-mers. Namely, the number of native contacts in the simulations with two 64-mers remains very close to the number observed in a single-chain simulation when < 0.2. For T < T m , the number of native contacts is maximal for an intermediate mean attraction because of two effects; these are: stronger aggregation for a strong mean attraction, and less native contacts for a single chain at a given temperature for a weak mean attraction, as discussed in the section on aggregation of 27-mers in more detail.
 ###### 
From cou.: 67 Very long simulations (more than 5×1010 MC steps) are necessary to obtain a stationary state in multi-chain simulations. Nevertheless, for many of the conditions studied, the results for different copies of chains of the same kind in a simulation do not agree well, although they should agree if the phase space is thoroughly sampled. Therefore, we do not present any numbers, but only trends that can be identified from our simulations.
From Soup: 67 Table 8 presents free energies for aggregation studies based on two different definitions of the native state, the conventional definition of 81 native contacts and the definition where the state is considered native if a chain has at least 60 “native” contacts. Whereas we indicated the necessity to use an ensemble of native states in our paper on a single 64-mer, 26 the choice of 60 contacts is somewhat arbitrary. We chose 60 because, while we do not want to include too many states in the native ensemble, nevertheless, we want to include the minimum of free energy corresponding to the folded state at 0.85 T m . When we require the folded state to be a fully folded state, the unfolded state is always dominant, as in 27-mer aggregation. When we use a native ensemble to allow some flexibility in the folded state, however, the folded state is the dominating state in a two-64-mer simulation under the condition of a weak or medium mean attraction and T = 0.85 T m , in agreement with the observation that the number of native contacts does not change much from the single-chain to the 2-chain simulation. For = 0.06, this dominant folded state is a relatively flexible folded state where the two chains prefer to have many contacts with water . Hence, because only very little aggregation is observed, the separated native state is the lowest free-energy state. For = 0.16, however, the native state is much less extended and at the concentration we use, an aggregated native state has almost the same free energy as the separated native state. Because aggregation is favored by high concentration, the result of the free energy being almost the same for the aggregated native state and the separate native state means that the proteins prefer to be in a separated native state at a low concentration with little flexibilty and can aggregate in their native state at a higher concentration, which corresponds to a crystal-like state. Fig. 4 shows a schematic of the lowest energy state of this simulation. In this figure, one chain is in its native state and has 12 intermolecular contacts with the other chain, while the second chain has only 77 native contacts according to the usual definition of native contacts. However, it can still be considered a member of the native ensemble. The chain in the maximal compact state lends one peripheral domain, SKEK, to the other chain, where it forces the same amino acids to rotate and to move out of their original positions. As a consequence, all 12 intermolecular contacts can be called quasi-native contacts, in the sense that these contacts consist of the same pairs of amino acids that exist in the same position in the native state, but now the contacts are with beads from a different chain. Something similar has been observed experimentally in the literature 30 as well as in simulation studies, 31 and is called domain swapping. In domain swapping, one protein buries one of its domains in the other protein and vice versa . This usually leads to a loss of native structure, function, and/or amyloid fibril formation. Our dimer is different in that one protein totally remains in its native structure, while the other one is only changed in its peripheral region. Further, our lowest-energy dimer cannot serve as a nucleation core for a fibril formation, because none of the two chains exhibits a domain or edge like the one involved in the contact between the two chains remaining at its surface. We therefore might call the process domain “lending”. The stabilization energy for the dimer for = 0.16 is 4.92 MJ energy units compared to that for two separated folded single chains, which is ca . 10–15 k B T for the temperatures used in our aggregation simulations.
 ###### 
From cou.: 68 In general, the higher the chain concentration, the more aggregation occurs, indicating fewer native contacts, more inter-chain contacts and a lower free energy of the aggregated structures. This trend is relatively weak for a weak mean attraction (=0.01) and more pronounced for a moderate to strong mean attraction.
From Soup: 68 When the mean attraction is stronger, = 0.26, much more aggregation takes place, as is seen for the 27-mer. No results are given in Table 6 for = 0.26 and T = 0.85 T m , because the simulation reaches the glass-like state above 0.85 T m ; reaching the glass-like state corresponds to irreversible, denatured aggregation. The values of the free energy in Table 8 for = 0.26 and T = 0.85 T m are only very approximate due to the glass-like behavior of the system under these conditions; they are only shown to illustrate the trend of a strong aggregation and the loss of native structure in aggregation simulations under these conditions.
 ###### 
From cou.: 69 When more chains are present in a simulation, the temperature of the transition to the glass-like state, where the phase space cannot be sampled completely, is shifted to a higher temperature. Although this temperature is below the midpoint temperature for all 2-chain simulations, it is about at the midpoint temperature for a strong mean attraction for the three-chain simulations and even higher for simulations with more chains. For a weak mean attraction, the transition occurs always at a temperature slightly below that for a high mean attraction, but rises above the midpoint temperature for a high concentration.
From Soup: 69 We performed some simulations to investigate the reason for the difference in stability against aggregation between the long and the short chains described in the previous paragraph. There is a difference in the fluctuations of native structure of a single chain associated with the length of the chain. At 0.85 T m , the 27-mer frequently unfolds to a large extent, whereas the 64-mer rarely loses more than 50% of its native contacts at this temperature. We could argue that the 64-mer does not expose its hydrophobic core at 0.85 T m and therefore aggregation is kinetically hindered, but the aggregated state may still be the lowest free-energy state. We ruled out this hypothesis by starting simulations with unfolded separated and unfolded aggregated chains. Under all starting conditions studied at 0.85 T m and when < 0.2, the chains separate (if applicable) and fold to their native structure which is then in equilibrium with weakly aggregated states and partially unfolded states. Therefore, we prefer to argue that the high stability against aggregation of the 64-mers is due to the large amount of very specific and attractive hydrophobic interactions in their cores that overpowers the hydrophobic intermolecular interaction with the second protein , provided that the mean attraction is not too strong. Therefore, the aggregation properties of the 64-mer are more realistic than those of the 27-mer, just like the properties of the single 64-mer are more realistic than those of the single 27-mer. 26
 ###### 
From cou.: 70 Previously, we established that 64-mers with our energy scale show more realistic behavior than do 27-mers.26 Therefore, it is useful to study the aggregation of 64-mer chains. Again, we present our results for two 64-mers in water using the same four aggregation states of Fig. 2. The progression of a simulation of two 64-mers is similar to that with two 27-mers. However, the degree of remaining native structure for the aggregation simulations with 64-mers can be quite different from the results for 27-mers, depending on temperature. Calculated results are shown in Table 6. The number of total contacts, folding time, and cooperativity can be compared with 64-mer single-chain results in Table 7. The results can also be compared with the aggregation results for two 27-mers in Tables 2 and 3. At the midpoint temperature, the general observations do not differ much from those for two 27-mers. For a weak mean attraction, the number of native contacts is close to the results for single-chain simulations; when increases, only a few native contacts remain. At Tm, similar to the 27-mer, states B and/or D in Fig. 2 dominate for all mean attractions studied. However, for a weak mean attraction the sructures are close to the native conformation. When the temperature is lowered, the quantitative behavior of two 64-mers is considerably different from two 27-mers. Namely, the number of native contacts in the simulations with two 64-mers remains very close to the number observed in a single-chain simulation when <0.2. For T<Tm, the number of native contacts is maximal for an intermediate mean attraction because of two effects; these are: stronger aggregation for a strong mean attraction, and less native contacts for a single chain at a given temperature for a weak mean attraction, as discussed in the section on aggregation of 27-mers in more detail.
From Soup: 70 We have applied our new interaction-energy scale, extended from the original Miyazawa–Jernigan interaction scale, towards simulation of aggregation. In the parameter space studied (selected combinations of 0.1 ≤ C s ≤ 0.4 and −0.01 ≤ ≤ 0.61) and with both 27-mers and 64-mers, we discover four regimes of different protein behavior. These are the same four regions that have been identified from single chain simulations based on stability of the compact native state, folding speed and cooperativity. Fig. 5 displays these four regions in – C s space and their approximate boundaries. Protein simulations using parameters from Regions I and IV show a behavior that is not typical for real proteins under native conditions. Region I reflects slow folding, weak cooperativity, and strong aggregation, mainly of the unfolded type. This type of aggregation is essentially irreversible even up to relatively high temperatures. The original MJ interaction energy matrix lies in Region I. In Region IV, we do not see much aggregation, but the most compact state is very unstable giving slow folding and a low cooperativity. Because there is a set of medium compact states with similar energies, essentially no folding–unfolding event is observed. Energy parameters characteristic of Regions II and III can be used to study real proteins , because they exhibit the most realistic behavior and allow the shortest simulation times. In Region II, the compact cube is the lowest energy state, and it exhibits the highest cooperativity, fast folding, and reversible aggregation down to the lowest temperatures T / T m of all interaction energy parameters. Therefore, Region II corresponds to proteins that have a compact native state that is well defined for all amino acids . Many real proteins show some flexibility even in the native state, and parts of the chain cannot be resolved in X-ray crystal structures. 29 Such proteins can be modeled with parameters from Region III and show the fastest folding, weakest aggregation, and still relatively high cooperativity. In our study, the reference state for folding rate and cooperativity is the compact cube. If this refence state is changed to an non-compact state, as recently suggested by Crippen and Chhajer, 29 proteins with parameters from Region II will probably show an even better behavior in the sense of fast folding and high cooperativity.
 ###### 
From cou.: 71 Table 8 presents free energies for aggregation studies based on two different definitions of the native state, the conventional definition of 81 native contacts and the definition where the state is considered native if a chain has at least 60 “native” contacts. Whereas we indicated the necessity to use an ensemble of native states in our paper on a single 64-mer,26 the choice of 60 contacts is somewhat arbitrary. We chose 60 because, while we do not want to include too many states in the native ensemble, nevertheless, we want to include the minimum of free energy corresponding to the folded state at 0.85Tm. When we require the folded state to be a fully folded state, the unfolded state is always dominant, as in 27-mer aggregation. When we use a native ensemble to allow some flexibility in the folded state, however, the folded state is the dominating state in a two-64-mer simulation under the condition of a weak or medium mean attraction and T=0.85Tm, in agreement with the observation that the number of native contacts does not change much from the single-chain to the 2-chain simulation. For =0.06, this dominant folded state is a relatively flexible folded state where the two chains prefer to have many contacts with water. Hence, because only very little aggregation is observed, the separated native state is the lowest free-energy state. For =0.16, however, the native state is much less extended and at the concentration we use, an aggregated native state has almost the same free energy as the separated native state. Because aggregation is favored by high concentration, the result of the free energy being almost the same for the aggregated native state and the separate native state means that the proteins prefer to be in a separated native state at a low concentration with little flexibilty and can aggregate in their native state at a higher concentration, which corresponds to a crystal-like state. Fig. 4 shows a schematic of the lowest energy state of this simulation. In this figure, one chain is in its native state and has 12 intermolecular contacts with the other chain, while the second chain has only 77 native contacts according to the usual definition of native contacts. However, it can still be considered a member of the native ensemble. The chain in the maximal compact state lends one peripheral domain, SKEK, to the other chain, where it forces the same amino acids to rotate and to move out of their original positions. As a consequence, all 12 intermolecular contacts can be called quasi-native contacts, in the sense that these contacts consist of the same pairs of amino acids that exist in the same position in the native state, but now the contacts are with beads from a different chain. Something similar has been observed experimentally in the literature30 as well as in simulation studies,31 and is called domain swapping. In domain swapping, one protein buries one of its domains in the other protein and vice versa. This usually leads to a loss of native structure, function, and/or amyloid fibril formation. Our dimer is different in that one protein totally remains in its native structure, while the other one is only changed in its peripheral region. Further, our lowest-energy dimer cannot serve as a nucleation core for a fibril formation, because none of the two chains exhibits a domain or edge like the one involved in the contact between the two chains remaining at its surface. We therefore might call the process domain “lending”. The stabilization energy for the dimer for =0.16 is 4.92 MJ energy units compared to that for two separated folded single chains, which is ca. 10–15 kBT for the temperatures used in our aggregation simulations.
From Soup: 71 The same four regions with approximately the same boundaries apply for 64-mers as for 27-mers. Whereas aggregation is weak but dominant for 27-mers, for 64-mers the aggregated, folded state is the dominant state in Region II and the separated, folded state is dominant in Region III. Therefore, Region II corresponds to a crystallisation-like behavior while Region III resembles folded proteins in solution. The transition from a native protein in solution to a crystallising protein can be caused by a very small change in the solvent parameters. This observation is in agreement with experimental observations ( e.g. for lysozyme see refs. 32 and 33 ).
 ###### 
From cou.: 72 When the mean attraction is stronger, =0.26, much more aggregation takes place, as is seen for the 27-mer. No results are given in Table 6 for =0.26 and T=0.85Tm, because the simulation reaches the glass-like state above 0.85Tm; reaching the glass-like state corresponds to irreversible, denatured aggregation. The values of the free energy in Table 8 for =0.26 and T=0.85Tm are only very approximate due to the glass-like behavior of the system under these conditions; they are only shown to illustrate the trend of a strong aggregation and the loss of native structure in aggregation simulations under these conditions.
From Soup: 72 Our simulations indicate that the three possible design goals (fast folding, high cooperativity, and stability against aggregation) for proteins are correlated. Therefore, if the system is optimized for one of the goals, the two others are rather close to their optimal values. This holds especially for the contrast parameter C s . For 27-mers, fastest folding requires a slightly lower mean attraction than does high cooperativity, whereas a mean attraction between these two optima is still very good for fast folding and for high cooperativity and additionally, ideal for stability against aggregation.
 ###### 
From cou.: 73 We performed some simulations to investigate the reason for the difference in stability against aggregation between the long and the short chains described in the previous paragraph. There is a difference in the fluctuations of native structure of a single chain associated with the length of the chain. At 0.85Tm, the 27-mer frequently unfolds to a large extent, whereas the 64-mer rarely loses more than 50% of its native contacts at this temperature. We could argue that the 64-mer does not expose its hydrophobic core at 0.85Tm and therefore aggregation is kinetically hindered, but the aggregated state may still be the lowest free-energy state. We ruled out this hypothesis by starting simulations with unfolded separated and unfolded aggregated chains. Under all starting conditions studied at 0.85Tm and when <0.2, the chains separate (if applicable) and fold to their native structure which is then in equilibrium with weakly aggregated states and partially unfolded states. Therefore, we prefer to argue that the high stability against aggregation of the 64-mers is due to the large amount of very specific and attractive hydrophobic interactions in their cores that overpowers the hydrophobic intermolecular interaction with the second protein, provided that the mean attraction is not too strong. Therefore, the aggregation properties of the 64-mer are more realistic than those of the 27-mer, just like the properties of the single 64-mer are more realistic than those of the single 27-mer.26
From Soup: 73 For 64-mers, the same parameter set is optimal for fast folding and high cooperativity. This parameter set leads to soluble native or crystall-like behavior in two-chain simulations, depending on protein concentration. A slightly weaker mean attraction leads to a slightly slower folding speed and weaker cooperativity but prevents aggregation.

From Soup: 74 From the differences between the 64-mer and the 27-mer, we can conclude that the 64-mer is a much more realistic protein model than the 27-mer. Although the 27-mer displays the basic features of protein folding, it seems too small for modelling faithfully the aggregation of proteins . Some experimental observations, like the existence of non-aggregating proteins and the ability of many proteins to crystallise as a result of small changes in solvent properties, can only be observed with the 64-mer.

From Soup: 75 The importance of a marginal stability of a native state to attain a realistic behavior can also be seen from our results for the 64-mer. As long as no disulfide bonds, hydrogen bonds, and charges are considered, it is possible to obtain fast folding, high cooperativity, and stability against aggregation only with a marginally stable native state.

From cou.: 76 Our simulations indicate that the three possible design goals (fast folding, high cooperativity, and stability against aggregation) for proteins are correlated. Therefore, if the system is optimized for one of the goals, the two others are rather close to their optimal values. This holds especially for the contrast parameter Cs. For 27-mers, fastest folding requires a slightly lower mean attraction than does high cooperativity, whereas a mean attraction between these two optima is still very good for fast folding and for high cooperativity and additionally, ideal for stability against aggregation.
From Soup: 76 The emphasis of this work is on the optimization of the amino acid – solvent interaction energies for native- protein -like behavior, including stability against aggregation. Nevertheless, we expect that the results of this study may be useful to study sequence-related effects of protein aggregation. In doing so, energy-scale-related aggregation effects can be separated from sequence-related aggregation effects. This may aid in improved understanding of aggregation processes. With a new energy scale the behavior of chains in water as solvent is now modeled more realistically and extension to other solvents is straightforward. Effects similar to those found by Giugliarelli et al. in two dimensions 20 can be studied with our model in three dimensions. Giugliarelli et al. found formation of compact states (states with minimal surface) and incompact native states for single chains. For bulk aggregation, these authors found three classes of protein -like sequences: non-aggregating, aggregating in the native state (crystallizing) and prion-like aggregates. In addition, for the two sizes studied, chain size has a strong effect on the results (stability of the native state, cooperativity and aggregation behavior). And finally, the effect of changing solvent characteristics on protein folding and aggregation can be studied with effective solvent -interaction energies. This has, in principle, been done by varying C s and . However, relations between our parameters and quantities like pH, salt concentration, and presence of CO or anti-solvents remain to be established.

From Soup: 111 is the size of the lattice in lattice units and is the interaction energy between an or bead on site ( , , ) and one on site ( , , ). During the simulation, end-flip, kink-bend, and crankshaft Monte Carlo moves are attempted. If we try to move a chain bead to a site occupied by another chain bead, the move is immediately rejected because we use self-avoiding chains. Otherwise, we try to exchange the bead with a bead on this site. Then, the move is accepted or rejected depending on the system–energy change Δ associated with the move in accordance with the Metropolis criterion: where , the Boltzmann constant, has the value of one MJ-energy unit/one associated temperature unit. MJ energies are based on contact frequencies, and, hence, they are only relative. To our knowledge, no conversion to conventional energy units is available. Therefore, for our purpose here, temperature can be expressed in any arbitrary unit.
