From cou.: 1 The metabolic activity of E. coli cells embedded in collagen gel microstructures in a cone-shaped well and in a cylindrical micropore was investigated using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), based on the oxygen consumption rate and the conversion rate from ferrocyanide to ferricyanide. The analysis of the concentration profiles for oxygen and ferrocyanide afforded the oxygen consumption rate and the ferrocyanide production rate. A comparison indicated that the ferrocyanide production rates were larger than the oxygen consumption rate, and also that the rates observed in the cylindrical micropore were larger than those observed in the cone-shaped well. The ferrocyanide production rate of a single E. coli cell was calculated to be (5.4 ± 2.6) × 10−19 mol s−1, using a cylindrical micropore system.

From cou.: 2 Establishing a method for quantitative evaluation of microbial metabolism will be beneficial in developing advanced biosensors, biofuel cell systems, and whole cell-based bioreactors, as well as for gaining a fundamental understanding of the microorganism itself. Various methods are available for monitoring the physiological activity of microorganisms on the basis of rates of glucose uptake,1–4 oxygen uptake,5–10 ion uptake,11–15 pH change,16–19 and enzymatic redox activity.20–26 The oxygen consumption rate or residual dissolved oxygen tension (rDOT) is one of the most prevalent factors that can be measured with an oxygen electrode.5–10 Several studies have used rDOT as an indicator to represent the cellular response under various micro-aerobic conditions. Harrison and Pirt5 firstly monitored the dissolved oxygen concentration in continuous cultures of Klebsiella aerogenes and Escherichia coli. Teixeria de Mattos and co-workers9,10 investigated the aerobic respiration of E. coli and suggested that the regulation of cytochrome content in its cells serves to maintain an internal oxygen concentration. The present study applied scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), as previously done by other research groups, to allow non-invasive monitoring of the cellular status. In the SECM measurements, the tip of a microelectrode probe is scanned near the cells to map the local distribution of electroactive species such as oxygen so as to obtain information on cellular activity.27–40

From cou.: 3 Another important trend in quantitative detection is to utilize artificial dyes as electron acceptors that either inflow or outflow from microbes.20–26 The electron transfer between a microbe and an electron mediator is extremely important, because cellular energy production by respiration is based on biological redox reactions. Hadjipetrou et al.20 reported in 1966 that ferricyanide acts as an electron acceptor for the metabolic oxidation of D-(+)-glucose in the E. coli cell. This implies that in principle, ferricyanide can be used as a mediator to carry electron(s) from D-(+)-glucose in an E. coli cell to the electrode during the reaction. Several recent studies, including those by Ikeda et al., have applied amperometric methods to measure the catalytic activity of intact bacterial cells, in the presence of artificial electron acceptors, to characterize the bacterial functions on the basis of a simple model of the catalytic reactions.21–26

A collagen type I solution (3.0 mg ml−1), an E. coli suspended solution, and 10 times concentrated PBS(−) buffer solution were mixed in a ratio of 8:2:1, according to the protocol of the collagen gel droplet culture kit (Nitta Gelatin, Inc., Japan). An aliquot (0.2 µl) of the above prepared solution was poured into the bottom part of a cone-shaped microwell using a micropipette (Nichiryo, Inc., Japan). In the cylindrical micropore, the pre-gelation solution was poured into the micropores using a glass capillary until the pore was completely filled. In order to promote the momentary gelation of the collagen, it was covered with a drop of PBS(−) buffer solution maintained at 37 °C. The numbers of embedded E. coli cells in the cone-shaped microwell and in the cylindrical micropore were typically in the order of 107 and 105, respectively, as estimated by the volume of collagen gel and the E. coli concentration in the primary suspension.

From cou.: 8 The fabrication procedure of a Pt microelectrode for the SECM measurements has been reported elsewhere.27–40 In brief, a Pt wire (radius 1.0–10.0 µm) was inserted into a glass capillary and then shielded by thermally fusing the glass. The tip of the capillary was carefully polished to obtain a disk-type microelectrode. The radius of the Pt disk at the tip was 3.0∼8.0 µm as determined from the voltammogram of ferrocyanide, while the tip radius including the insulating glass part was ca. 20.0 µm. By means of a motor-driven XYZ stage, the Pt microelectrode was scanned from the center of the E. coli collagen gel surface to the bulk at intervals of 50 µm. Ferricyanide was used as the electron acceptor for measuring the respiration activity of E. coli cells in the collagen gel. The potential of the tip electrode was held at −0.50 V vs. Ag/AgCl to detect the localized oxygen reduction current and at 0.60 V vs. Ag/AgCl to detect the localized ferrocyanide oxidation current. The SECM measurements were conducted at room temperature in a PBS(−) buffer solution (25 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM Na2HPO4, 100 mM NaCl; pH 6.77) containing 20 mM D-(+)-glucose with and without 100 mM K3Fe(CN)6.

From Soup: 35 In the following section, we show that the F total z values are virtually constant at any distance ( z ) only if the distance ( z ) is sufficiently larger than the size of the E. coli -collagen gel microstructure. We have several supplemental results concerning on the diffusion behavior in the gel structure. The diffusion rate for ferrocyanide through a hole (with a diameter of ca . 100 µm) with the gel was found to be 7.5 to 15 fold smaller compared with that without collagen. We also confirmed that the diffusion rate within the collagen gel is at least 10 times larger compared with the rate of ferrocyanide production from the E. coli embedded collagen gel microstructure used in the study. Hence, the rate determining point with the microbial chip in the present study is the respiration by E. coli embedded on the chip but not the diffusion process in the collagen gel.

The tip detects oxygen reduction current to monitor local oxygen concentration near the E. coli spot. A bright area with lower oxygen reduction current was found near the spot in the cone-shaped microwell ( Fig. 2(a) ) and in the cylindrical micropore ( Fig. 2(b) ). The E. coli cells consume oxygen by aerobic respiration and, therefore, the concentration of oxygen around the E. coli collagen gel becomes lower in comparison with the bulk solution. 31 The oxygen consumption rate of E. coli cells could be calculated from the SECM images for the cone-shaped microwell and the cylindrical micropore.

As the distance from the bottom of the cone increases, the S well z becomes larger. The f z value was calculated from the concentration profile monitored by SECM using eqn. (2) . The F well z , a product of S well z and f z , is almost constant except at distances very close to the E. coli collagen gel surface, as shown in Fig. 3(c) .

However, a relatively larger deviation was observed near the cylindrical micropore, in comparison with the case of the cone-shaped microwell. The concentration distribution above the cylindrical micropore is ideally not hemi-spherical within a distance of 300 µm (namely the region ( z / r s ) < 2).

From Soup: 42 Fig. 6 shows the variation in S well z , f z and F well z for ferrocyanide production against distance ( z ) in the cone-shaped microwell. The F well z value in the plateau region was estimated to be 1.1 × 10 −11 mol s −1 , which corresponded to the total ferrocyanide production rate of E. coli cells in the cone-shaped microwell. For the cylindrical micropore, the F pore z value reaches a constant at distances larger than 250 µm and was estimated as 1.4 × 10 −13 mol s −1 ( Fig. 7 ) in this region.

From Soup: 43 The metabolic activities of a single E. coli cell are discussed below. 25 The oxygen consumption rate ( K cell oxygen ) and the ferrocyanide production rate ( K cell ferro ) were determined by dividing F z by the cell number embedded in the collagen gel spot and are summarized in Table 1 . The K cell ferro values are higher than K cell oxygen values for both the cone-shaped microwell and the cylindrical micropore. This difference can be attributed mainly to the difference in the number of electron(s) required for the redox reactions. In the respiratory chain, oxygen is reduced to water via 4-electron reduction , whereas, the reduction of ferricyanide requires only one electron. If all the electrons are involved in the reduction of ferricyanide, the value of K cell ferro will be four times larger than K cell oxygen . The difference in the kinetics of enzymes for the reductions of oxygen and ferricyanide could also be a cause of this difference between K cell ferro and K cell oxygen . Unfortunately, it was difficult to simultaneously determine oxygen and ferrocyanide near the collagen gel spot using our system; hence, this problem can not be further discussed at this stage. Another important fact observed in Table 1 is that the metabolic activities occurring in the cylindrical micropore system are higher than those in the cone-shaped microwell system. This is probably because the depth of the micropore containing the microbial gel spot is considerably shallow (25 µm) as compared with that of the cone-shaped microwell (450 µm). The metabolic activity of the individual cells would be higher for the cells located near the gel/liquid interface. Further, the net metabolic activity of the cells embedded in the bottom part of the cone-shaped microwell would be low because the concentrations of metabolism-related species are lower in this area. In particular, depletion of oxygen in this area resulted in a low K cell oxygen in the cone-shaped microwells.

From Soup: 44 Further investigations were carried out on the relation between the metabolic activity of a single cell and the cell density within the gel, using the cylindrical micropore system with ferricyanide as a mediator. Fig. 8 shows the ferrocyanide production rate of a single E. coli cell as a function of the number of the cells embedded in the collagen gel. Observations revealed that the ferrocyanide production rate was almost independent of the cell number in the 10 4 –10 6 regions. From the above result, K cell ferro was found to be (5.4 ± 2.6) × 10 −19 mol s −1 . It was believed that the cylindrical micropore system is appropriate for quantitative analysis of metabolic activity with small sample volumes.

From Soup: 45 In conclusion, the metabolic activities of E. coli cells embedded in a cone-shaped microwell and a cylindrical micropore were quantitatively investigated using SECM . The oxygen consumption rate and ferrocyanide production rate of the embedded E. coli cells were measured in a cone-shaped microwell system and a cylindrical micropore system. The quantitative investigations demonstrated that when a cylindrical micropore system was used, a single E. coli cell converted ferricyanide to ferrocyanide at the rate of (5.4 ± 2.6) × 10 −19 mol s −1 .
