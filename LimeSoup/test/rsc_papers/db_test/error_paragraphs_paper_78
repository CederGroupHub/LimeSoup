From cou.: 1 We are delighted to announce that 2006 will see the launch of a new supplement from the RSC—Chemical Biology.
From Soup: 1 Chemistry or chemical techniques are now integral to the understanding of biological processes at the atomic and molecular level. The RSC has recognised the significance and value of the exciting research in this area and is building on the success of its existing chemical biology portfolio in this new venture.

From cou.: 3 As the traditional boundaries between biology and chemistry become ever more blurred, the RSC is committed to publishing significant research at the interface between these disciplines.
From Soup: 3 A companion publication to the successful Chemical Science and Chemical Technology supplements, Chemical Biology will draw together material from all RSC publications. It aims to complement the news service offered by the first two supplements, providing a ‘snapshot’ of the latest developments from the more biological aspects of research.

From cou.: 4 A companion publication to the successful Chemical Science and Chemical Technology supplements, Chemical Biology will draw together material from all RSC publications. It aims to complement the news service offered by the first two supplements, providing a ‘snapshot’ of the latest developments from the more biological aspects of research.
From Soup: 4 From early in 2006 Chemical Biology will be freely available online and as a monthly supplement in the print issues of Organic & Biomolecular Chemistry, Molecular BioSystems, Natural Product Reports and Photochemical & Photobiological Sciences.

From cou.: 5 From early in 2006 Chemical Biology will be freely available online and as a monthly supplement in the print issues of Organic & Biomolecular Chemistry, Molecular BioSystems, Natural Product Reports and Photochemical & Photobiological Sciences.
From Soup: 5 Latest news will be added to the online version of the supplement ‘as it happens’ ensuring access to the most up-to-date information. Extra content will be available to online readers and all of the news items will link directly to the original research articles which will be free to access forever.

Extra content will be available to online readers and all of the news items will link directly to the original research articles which will be free to access forever.
From Soup: 6 Chemical Biology will be intimately related to the successful Chemical Biology Virtual Journal ( www.rsc.org/chembiolvj ) which was launched back in 2002. Together they will assist the chemical biology community by drawing together the significant amount of relevant work published across all RSC journals. The new supplement will highlight the very best and most newsworthy articles from the Virtual Journal.

From Soup: 7 This year has seen the launch of Molecular BioSystems, a high quality interdisciplinary journal publishing novel and challenging chemical biology research. This journal has a particular focus on the interface between chemistry and the -omic sciences and systems biology. ChemComm, Organic & Biomolecular Chemistry, Natural Product Reports, Photochemical & Photobiological Sciences and other established RSC journals will also continue to attract and publish excellent chemical biology of relevance to the scope of each journal. Why not submit your latest research today via www.rsc.org/ReSourCe ?
