From cou.: 1 The nitrogen factor (the percentage of nitrogen in the raw flesh) was determined on 70 samples of scampi taken on a total of nine fishing trips to two fishing grounds over a period of 16 months. A representative sample of the catch from each fishing trip was classified on board the fishing vessel for size, sex and shell condition. Selected samples were placed in plastic boxes, sealed and stored on ice until landing (the ice did not come into contact with the animals) when 500 g samples were sealed into plastic bags and blast frozen at −20 °C. The samples were stored at −20 °C until thawed in the laboratory prior to analysis. The objective was to produce a figure for the nitrogen content of the separated meat portion which represented the composition of the material ‘fresh from the sea’. Samples were analysed for fat, moisture, ash and nitrogen content by standardised procedures. It is known that changes in composition can take place during commercial handling and processing of the whole scampi and the figure obtained in this exercise would therefore represent a standard for comparison with the commercially processed material.

From cou.: 2 The nitrogen content was significantly higher and the moisture content significantly lower in hard-shelled scampi than those with thin or soft shells. However, taking into account the distribution of the shell type in the catches an overall figure of 2.90 is recommended for the nitrogen factor of scampi fresh from the sea.

From cou.: 3 In commercial fishing practice the heads of the scampi are removed on board the fishing vessel and discarded and the tail portions are packed in plastic fish boxes which are sealed and stored in ice. In parallel with the investigation carried out by the Analytical Methods Committee on the composition of scampi fresh from the sea, the Sea Fish Industry Authority carried out an exercise to determine the proximate composition of the tail meat during commercial processing. Samples were taken at all stages during the processing operation and these sample were analysed by the same laboratories as had analysed the samples of scampi fresh from the sea and working to the same QC standards. This work is reported in the Appendix.

From cou.: 6 The scampi or Dublin Bay prawn (Nephrops norvegicus) is the single most valuable shellfish species landed in the United Kingdom. In the form of frozen and chilled scampi tails coated in batter and/or bread crumbs the product is of considerable commercial importance. The content of scampi per se is clearly a matter of legitimate concern to consumers. An agreed procedure for the determination of the scampi content of products offered for sale is thus desirable. The most reliable method for this purpose is comparison of the fish nitrogen content of the product with the nitrogen content (i.e., the nitrogen factor) of the original raw flesh of the scampi.

From cou.: 7 It is acknowledged that sea fishing is an adventitious operation and that, unlike the conditions that apply to meat animals and poultry, the conditions affecting the growth of Nephrops norvegicus in the sea cannot be controlled. The Nitrogen Factors Sub-Committee was asked to undertake a reassessment of the nitrogen factor for this species as caught straight from the sea and to make recommendations for the value which would be more authoritative than those hitherto available. Details of the investigation carried out were organised by a Working Group under the Chairmanship of Dr. R. A. Allen, other members of the group being Mr. N. Harrison, Mrs. D. B. Homer and Mr. C. R. Morrison. The group worked in close association with the Sea Fish Industry Authority.

From cou.: 10 The scampi, when freshly caught, were packed in baskets and washed on board, using sea-water from a deck hose. The category/frequency distribution of the catch on each trip was assessed by classifying the individual animals in a basket selected at random by sex (male/female), size (carapace length‡ in groups ranging from 21–25 up to 46–50 mm) and shell condition (hard, thin, soft).§ A total of 35 batches of scampi, classified in this way, were derived from the Fladen ground and a further 35, similarly classified, from the Irish Sea.

From cou.: 11 After classification, 5 kg portions of the well drained, whole scampi of each category represented in the catch were placed in thick, sealable, plastic storage boxes. They were then sealed and placed on ice, the latter being replenished as required. No ice came into contact with the sample. Within 72 h of capture, about 500 g of each category represented in the catch were placed in thick, sealable polythene bags, overwrapped with two further polythene bags, blast frozen and stored at −20 °C until prepared for chemical analysis. The 70 samples were distributed at −20 °C following a statistically determined pattern to five independent accredited laboratories, viz., LGC (Teddington) Ltd., Bristol City Council, Scientific Services, Dundee City Council, Scientific Services, United Biscuits UK Ltd., Group Research and Development, High Wycombe and Unilever Research, Colworth Laboratory.

Prior to chemical analysis, samples were defrosted by placing the batches in chilled air (0–5 °C) for 3–4 h. Following a prescribed manual procedure the tail portion was dissected from the carapace, the flesh removed from the exoskeleton and the black intestinal material and gut contents removed from the flesh.

From Soup: 12 Duplicate determinations (minimum) of fat, moisture, ash and nitrogen were made on each prepared flesh sample using procedures of BS 4401 (or by approved variants thereof which had been shown to give equivalent results).

From Soup: 13 The nitrogen content || of the samples of scampi examined in the present study ranged from 2.56 to 3.25% and reflects the variable composition of the individual categories of the animals as caught. No statistically significant effect of season was found, but there was some evidence that both fat and nitrogen contents followed a seasonal trend, being maximal in October and minimal in April, whereas moisture was minimal in October and maximal in April. Although the composition of scampi from the Fladen ground and the Irish Sea did not differ significantly, the size of those caught in the Irish Sea tended to be smaller.

From Soup: 14 The effect of sex on the proximate composition is shown in Table 1 . The higher fat and nitrogen content of the males, however, was not statistically significant.

 ###### 
From cou.: 16 The effect of shell condition on the proximate composition is shown in Table 2.
From Soup: 16 The nitrogen content was significantly higher, and the moisture content significantly lower, in hard shelled scampi than in those with thin or soft shells. Although the estimates for soft shelled scampi are higher for moisture and lower for nitrogen than for the other shell types, the variability of measurement on this small group meant that the differences were not significant.

Although the estimates for soft shelled scampi are higher for moisture and lower for nitrogen than for the other shell types, the variability of measurement on this small group meant that the differences were not significant.
From Soup: 17 It is thus appropriate to take account of the relative contributions ** of each type of shell condition in endeavouring to specify a nitrogen factor for scampi. The value so obtained is 2.90.

From Soup: 19 A nitrogen factor of 2.90 for fresh scampi as caught from the sea is lower than the value (3.05) reported in an internal memorandum from the former Torry Research Station 5 although the scatter of values reported in the latter, viz. , 2.73–3.35, is similar to that found in the present study. The Torry investigations were carried out under less stringent conditons, however, and did not assess the effect of shell condition, which has been shown to have a significant effect on the nitrogen content. The Nitrogen Factors Sub-Committee believes it to be preferable to use 2.90 as the nitrogen factor for scampi straight from the sea and believes that this is the most appropriate value on the basis of current knowledge of the type of scampi likely to be caught.

From Soup: 21 In parallel to the investigation by the AMC to determine the nitrogen content of scampi as caught fresh from the sea, the Sea Fish Industry Authority conducted processing trials to ascertain the effects of storage on ice, methods of freezing, defrosting, peeling and draining on the proximate composition of scampi. These treatments were designed, and carried out, to replicate as closely as possible the commercial handling and processing practices encountered in the industry. The processing may involve iced storage, washing, freezing, cold storage, water jet or mechanical peeling, de-veining, cleaning, treatment with polyphosphate, comminution and extrusion prior to enrobing, breading and finally being frozen. Many of these processes are necessary to ensure hygenic material for the production of breaded scampi products.

From Soup: 33 An analysis of variance with terms for the process variables was fitted to the chemical components. In summary ( Table 11 ) this showed that there were no significant differences, due to freezing and draining after peeling, in the chemical composition, but storage on ice, peeling and cleaning were important factors in determining nitrogen and ash content. Peeling and cleaning were also important in determining moisture content of the scampi tail meats. Least square means are shown in Table 12 . Storage on ice for the three day period significantly reduced the mean nitrogen content by 0.10%.

From Soup: 34 Although peeling in itself had a significant effect on the nitrogen , moisture and ash contents, and produced the largest differences, there was no significant difference between the peeling methods employed. Peeling reduced the nitrogen content by about 0.3% while increasing the moisture content by about 2.5% ( Table 12 ). Cleaning reduced both nitrogen and ash content by 0.14% and 0.28%, respectively, whilst increasing moisture content by 1.0%, but these changes were relatively small compared with the compositional changes brought about by peeling. Draining after cleaning brought about a small increase in nitrogen by 0.08%.

From Soup: 35 These trials show that statistically significant changes in the nitrogen and moisture contents of scampi tail meats occur due to iced storage, peeling and cleaning: these are essential processes in the production of breaded scampi under Good Manufacturing Practice. Cumulatively these currently necessary processes reduced the nitrogen content of the tail meats by about 0.62% ( i.e. , storage on ice −0.1, peeling −0.3, cleaning −0.14 and draining after cleaning −0.08%) and increased the moisture content by about 3.5% ( i.e. , peeling +2.5 and cleaning +1.0%).
