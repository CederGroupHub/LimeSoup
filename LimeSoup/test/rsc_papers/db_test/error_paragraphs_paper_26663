From cou.: 1 A high value of magnetic moment of 0.08 emu g−1 at room temperature for SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) was observed. Surface functionalization with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) enhanced the saturation magnetic moment of NPs to an anomalously high value of 0.187 emu g−1 by altering the electronic configuration on the NPs surface. Surface functionalization also suppressed photoluminescence (PL) peaks arising from oxygen defects around 2 eV and caused an increase in the intensities of two peaks near the violet region (2.6–3 eV). PL studies under a uniform external magnetic field enriched the understanding of the role of OTS. Both OTS and external magnetic fields significantly modulated the luminescence spectra by altering the surface electronic structure of NPs. Extra spins on the surface of SnO2 NPs created by the surface functionalization process and their influence on resultant magnetic moment and luminescence properties are discussed in detail.

From cou.: 2 SnO2 is a diamagnetic wide band-gap (3.62 eV), n-type semiconductor. Irrespective of its wide direct band gap and large exciton-binding energy of 130 meV,1 its dipole-forbidden band-edge quantum states do not allow band-to-band transitions.2 As a result, defect energy levels guide the optical transitions. The controlled modulation of defects, however, is needed to make SnO2 a practical material for magnetic and optical applications. The annealing of amorphous SnO2 thin films in optimized conditions showed sharp UV light emission, which was used for diode application in the n-SnO2/p-GaN heterostructure.3

From cou.: 3 Surface functionalization influences the electronic configuration of metal oxides and metals at considerable rates.4–7 Electrical and optoelectronic performances of one-dimensional ZnO nanostructures were improved by surface functionalization with organic molecules.6,7 When Au nanoparticles (NPs) were coated with organic molecules (thiols), they were found to be ferromagnetic, even at room temperature.8,9 Since then, a large number of works on the organic-material-coated Au, Ag revealed that the ferromagnetism was intrinsic. The S atom of thiol formed covalent bonds with Au atoms on the surface, which led to localization of the d-hole around Au atoms, with well-defined moments.8,9 Surface functionalization with thiol, amine, trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) molecules caused 10 nm diamagnetic ZnO NPs to gain magnetic moments of 0.949, 0.158, 0.001 μB per NP, respectively.10 Extensive experimental work on the tuning of the magnetic moment by coating on metal oxide NPs are reviewed by Crespo et al.9 More recently, it is found that the induced moment due to functionalisation by organic molecules on various metal oxide semiconductors points to an oscillated moment with surfactant concentration. The induced moment on an individual 4 nm SnO2 oxide nanoparticle oscillates between 0.007 to 0.201 μB/NP with TOPO and 0.007 to 0.0226 μB/NP with poly (acryl acid) PAA functionalization, as an increased amount of charges transfer from the surfactant molecules to the NPs. The magnetisation is also reported to saturate at very small fields of 2 kOe.11

From cou.: 4 Octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) is one of the widely used silanes as self-assembled monolayers, particularly in organic semiconductors.12,13 Herein, we report a very high saturation magnetic moment in SnO2 NPs (0.08 emu g−1) for pristine 4 and 25 nm NPs. The moments per particle for 4 and 25 nm NPs is 2 and 492 μB/NP, respectively. A simple one-step surface functionalization with OTS renders further improvement in the saturation magnetic moment to 0.187 emu g−1 (4.7 μB/NP) in 4 nm and 0.143 emu g−1 (879 μB/NP) in 25 nm NPs. This change in the moment is very large and indicates that individual NPs carry very high moments when compared with reported values.9 The mechanism of moment formation is clearly different from earlier known mechanisms. We have observed large rearrangements in the spectral weights of the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of SnO2 NPs due to surface functionalisation. Similar spectral rearrangements in the PL intensity occur in pure SnO2 NPs under a uniform external magnetic field (H = 0.1 T). We present a local quantum chemical modeling of bonding of OTS molecules to different sites on the surface allowing a localised spin 1/2 close to the binding site. This allows for the building up of large moments in individual NPs. The identical role for both OTS and external magnetic fields in modulating luminescence properties of SnO2 NPs validates our proposed model of moment formation and correlates it with ions to defect energy levels.

Raman spectroscopy was used to confirm the atomic bonding between OTS and SnO2 NPs. Micro-Raman spectroscopy (InVia; Renishaw) using 514.5 nm excitation of Ar+ laser is carried out with 1800 gr mm−1 grating and a thermoelectric-cooled CCD detector in the backscattering configuration. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; M s−1 SPECS GmbH, Germany) was employed to study the stoichiometry of the surface of NPs from the quantitative analysis of both Sn and O. The PL spectra were acquired using 325 nm line from He–Cd laser as the excitation source at RT. Temperature-dependent measurements were performed in adiabatic stages (Linkam, UK). Two permanent bar magnets were used to create uniform magnetic fields. The magnetic properties of the samples were studied by a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM-Mini cryo).

From cou.: 7 The mean diameter of SnO2 NPs annealed at 300 °C is observed to be ∼4 nm from the TEM image and size-distribution plot (Fig. 1(a and b)). Fig. 1(c) shows the HRTEM image of crystalline (110) plane with d-spacing of 3.39 Å, corresponding to rutile SnO2 (JCPDS #41-1445) in the inset (zoomed).

From cou.: 8 Room-temperature (RT) magnetic hysteresis curves of the functionalized and pristine SnO2 NPs were recorded using VSM (Fig. 3). The inset in Fig. 3 shows the magnified region of around 0.0 T. The RT saturation magnetization is about 0.08 emu g−1 at a field H = 0.5 T for both of the sized NPs. Surface stoichiometry analysis by XPS has revealed the O to Sn ratio in 4 and 25 nm as 1.7 and 1.55, respectively (Fig. S2†). This indicates O deficiency in 25 nm NPs surface is higher than the 4 nm NPs. PL measurements further support this observation. Oxygen vacancy-related PL peak intensity around 2 eV is higher in 25 nm NPs than 4 nm NPs (Fig. 4). Higher defect density in 25 nm NPs compensates lesser surface area in 25 nm NPs. As a result, we see a similar amount of moment per gram of both 4 and 25 nm NPs. This high defect density in 25 nm NPs is due to the desorption of O from the surface of the NPs while annealing the as-prepared material at high temperature 800 °C. However, 4 nm NPs were obtained by annealing the as-prepared material at 300 °C only. Magnetic moments were also observed in un-doped, wide-band-gap metal oxides such as HfO2, TiO2, In2O3, Al2O3, CeO2, which are basically diamagnetic in bulk form.15 There is a general consensus now that the magnetism in these oxides occurs from lattice defects like O vacancies.9 There are suggestions16 that the moment in pristine SnO2 NPs may come from Sn vacancies as well.

From cou.: 9 After the functionalization of the particles, the RT saturation magnetization value increases to 0.18 emu g−1 at H = 0.5 T; i.e. the net magnetization doubles (Fig. 3). The bonding scheme12 (Fig. 2) shows that a Si atom forms four single bonds: one with a C atom, two with oxygen atoms that are not part of the SnO2 particle (adsorbed atmospheric oxygen atom, Oa) and only one with either an O atom or O vacancy (denoted as Os in Fig. 2) on the surface of the particle. Oxygen, in an ionic insulator like SnO2, is in the O−2 state, which is a filled shell. The formation of a single bond with a Si atom leaves one extra unpaired electron on the O atom if the Si atom forms a singlet bond with one of the two electrons in a neutral oxygen vacancy (Ov−2) site on the surface. Herein, also one electron is left with an extra spin S = 1/2 near the oxygen vacancy site. However, if the oxygen vacancy (Ov−1) site is charged, containing only one electron, then the bonding with Si actually leads to the disappearance of spin S = 1/2. In our bonding scheme, each OTS molecule injects a local spin 1/2 on the surface of the particles and each individual nanoparticle acquires large moments. Natural interaction between such injected spins due to localised electrons is antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction. The inset of Fig. 3 shows that there is an increase in coercive field with functionalisation. This seems natural because with an increase in the number of spin 1/2 moments, the mutual interaction between the injected moments on the surface can lead to the increase in the spin–spin correlation length, which approaches the particle size. Thus, each nanoparticle will behave like a supermoment and induce hysteretic behaviour because of the average anisotropic energy of each supermoment. The magnetic moment of 4.1 nm + OTS material is higher than the moment of 25 nm + OTS. The surface area of 4.1 nm NPs compared with 25 nm NPs is higher. This helps more OTS molecules to bind to 4.1 nm NPs than 25 nm NPs. The effect of this induced magnetisation on its defect-related optical property like PL was also studied and is discussed in the following section.

From cou.: 10 PL studies were performed on both the pristine and functionalized SnO2 NPs for the defect origin of magnetization in the materials. The effect of a magnetic field on the luminescence properties of these materials was investigated to unravel the possible origin of magnetic moments. All PL studies were performed on 25 nm NPs, which showed a band gap of (3.6 eV) in order to excite all of the defect bands with an He–Cd laser (325 nm) of 3.81 eV excitation.14Fig. 5 shows the PL spectra of 25 nm NPs for (a) pristine NPs, (b) OTS functionalized and (c) pristine SnO2 NPs under a uniform external magnetic field. A broad luminescence peak around 2 eV was observed for all three cases. Similar luminescence behavior for SnO2 nanobelts, nanoribbons and nanowires was also reported.17–21 Peaks at 2.77 eV and 2.97 eV were also present in pristine material with faint intensity (inset of Fig. 5). A broad peak in the visible region of the spectra around 2 eV was suppressed, and peaks in the violet region at intensities of 2.77 eV and 2.97 eV were slightly enhanced in the presence of a uniform magnetic field. A similar effect was observed pronouncedly in OTS-treated NPs. The magnified spectra for a pristine sample in the absence and in the presence of magnetic field (inset of Fig. 5) display two clear peaks at ∼2.77 and 2.97 eV. It is obvious from Fig. 5 and S4 (ESI†) that there were no new peaks due to OTS treatment. OTS molecules only modulated intensities of the existing peaks in SnO2. In order to investigate the various transition energies, all of the curves were fitted using Gaussian and shown in Fig. 6(a–d). Fig. 6(d) shows the Gaussian fit of faint intensity peaks at 2.77 and 2.97 eV in the presence and the absence of a magnetic field. It is convenient to discuss features in the PL spectra for energies E < 2.6 eV and E > 2.6 eV. The PL spectra with E < 2.6 eV can be easily deconvoluted, and it essentially has five broad lines with peaks at 1.84, 1.97, 2.12, 2.28 and 2.44 eV (Fig. 6). The peak positions and fractional areas of each peak are given in Table 1. The arrows in Table 1 indicate increase or decrease of fractional area as compared to the pristine sample. The peak positions are not found to change in the functionalized NPs. The fractions of the peak area for pristine SnO2 are to be 11%, 28.3%, 30.1%, 20.6% and 9.1% for electronic transitions with emitted photon energies centering, E, at 1.84, 1.97, 2.12, 2.28, 2.44 eV, respectively. After functionalization of these NPs (see Fig. 5), two incidents occur: (1) there is an overall reduction of the intensity in the first four channels (see subsequent discussions), but more importantly, (2) the fractions corresponding to the five peaks previously discussed changes to 4.8%, 16.6%, 24.1%, 23.3% and 32.1%. The emission peaks at 1.97 and 2.12 eV are decreased, and emission peaks at 2.28 and 2.44 eV channels are increased after functionalization (Table 1).

From cou.: 11 Similar types of changes, except for first peak, were observed for the PL spectrum of pristine SnO2 NPs taken in the presence of an external magnetic field of H = 0.1 T (Fig. 5). In summary, the application of an external magnetic field and the surface functionalization of SnO2 NPs had the same systematic effect of reduction in emissions at 1.97 and 2.12 eV with an increase at 2.28 and 2.44 eV channels (Table 1). The fractional area was simply proportional to the fractional number of electronic transitions in these five channels. The reasons for this observation are discussed below, which are intimately linked with the observed magnetic moments originating from defects in the SnO2 particles. It was reported in the time-resolved X-ray-induced PL study19 that the PL spectra with E > 2.6 eV had a very fast decay lifetime (below 10 ns), indicating direct electronic transition from the conduction band bottom to acceptor states, whereas the decay time for PL emissions below 2.6 eV was typically more than 570 ns, indicating an initial trapped state of the electrons at some vacancies, slightly below the conduction band edge (shallow donor). Fig. S3 (see ESI†) shows the temperature dependence of PL for the pristine sample. The PL intensity in the energy window, E < 2.6 eV, increases progressively as the temperature decreases. This observation supports the transitions from the shallow donor levels.21,22 There were several experimental studies showing shallow donor levels existing below the CBM.19,23,24 Energy levels deep inside the band gap can appear from oxygen vacancies existing in the bulk of the NPs.25,26 Herein, we present a schematic band diagram to understand the existence of such large numbers of PL bands (Fig. 7). Surface oxygen vacancy related to shallow donor level is denoted as ES. There are four deep levels, with energies E1, E2, E3 and E4, which are defined as follows: E1 = E[OBV(1e−)], E2 = E[OBV(2e−)], E3 = E[OPV(1e−)], and E4 = E[OPV(2e−)], where E1 and E2 are the levels for the first and the second electrons, respectively, at the in-plane oxygen (represented as OP in Fig. 2) site vacancy OPV sites. Similarly, E3 and E4 are the levels for the first and the second electrons, respectively, at the bridging oxygen site (represented as OB in Fig. 2) vacancy OBV sites. E2 and E4 are higher than E1 and E3, respectively, because of the need for the extra Coulomb repulsion energy to place the second electron (with opposite spin) at the vacancy site. Unlike the shallow donor level ES, where the electron wave functions have finite extension over multiple lattice spacing, the deep-level electron wave functions are far less extended. This is why the Coulomb repulsion is important, and the levels for the first and second electrons in such deep vacancy levels are considered to be different.27 Various transitions with the energy of the emitted photons are denoted in Fig. 7. Herein, E2 − E1 = 0.32 eV, and E4 − E3 = 0.31 eV. These differences are roughly the Coulomb repulsion energy, which has been discussed above. The transitions from ES → E1 and ES → E3 occur when the bridging and the in-plane ‘O’ vacancy sites have no electrons. Hence, electrons with any spin ↑ (up) or ↓ (down) from ES can come down with equal probability. The presence of an external magnetic field has no effect on these transition probabilities. However, the transitions from ES → E2 and ES → E4 occur when the bridging and planar O vacancy sites have already one electron. An external magnetic field polarizes the existing electrons in (E2, E4) levels along its direction (↑). This prevents the transition of an ↑ spin electron from ES to (E2, E4). In other words, an external magnetic field will suppress the number of transitions from ES → E2 and ES → E4, with emitted photon energies of 1.97 and 2.12 eV. Because the total number of emitted photons is conserved, there will be a corresponding rise in the emitted PL intensity in the ES → E1 and ES → E3 transitions at energies of 2.28 and 2.44 eV. The origin of the peak at 1.84 eV is not clear to us. It may be due to some kind of defect complexes related to a hydroxyl or oxygenated species.28 The intensity of the peak, however, does not systematically vary with functionalization or with the application of a magnetic field (Table 1). This indicates that the defect at 1.84 eV does not take part in the spin-polarization process. Thus, we have not included the electronic transition related to it in the band diagram.
From Soup: 11 Similar types of changes, except for first peak, were observed for the PL spectrum of pristine SnO 2 NPs taken in the presence of an external magnetic field of H = 0.1 T ( Fig. 5 ). In summary, the application of an external magnetic field and the surface functionalization of SnO 2 NPs had the same systematic effect of reduction in emissions at 1.97 and 2.12 eV with an increase at 2.28 and 2.44 eV channels ( Table 1 ). The fractional area was simply proportional to the fractional number of electronic transitions in these five channels. The reasons for this observation are discussed below, which are intimately linked with the observed magnetic moments originating from defects in the SnO 2 particles. It was reported in the time-resolved X-ray-induced PL study 19 that the PL spectra with E > 2.6 eV had a very fast decay lifetime (below 10 ns), indicating direct electronic transition from the conduction band bottom to acceptor states, whereas the decay time for PL emissions below 2.6 eV was typically more than 570 ns, indicating an initial trapped state of the electrons at some vacancies, slightly below the conduction band edge (shallow donor). Fig. S3 (see ESI † ) shows the temperature dependence of PL for the pristine sample. The PL intensity in the energy window, E < 2.6 eV, increases progressively as the temperature decreases. This observation supports the transitions from the shallow donor levels. 21,22 There were several experimental studies showing shallow donor levels existing below the CBM. 19,23,24 Energy levels deep inside the band gap can appear from oxygen vacancies existing in the bulk of the NPs. 25,26 Herein, we present a schematic band diagram to understand the existence of such large numbers of PL bands ( Fig. 7 ). Surface oxygen vacancy related to shallow donor level is denoted as E S . There are four deep levels, with energies E 1 , E 2 , E 3 and E 4 , which are defined as follows: E 1 = E [O B V (1e − )], E 2 = E [O B V (2e − )], E 3 = E [O P V (1e − )], and E 4 = E [O P V (2e − )], where E 1 and E 2 are the levels for the first and the second electrons, respectively, at the in-plane oxygen (represented as O P in Fig. 2 ) site vacancy O P V sites. Similarly, E 3 and E 4 are the levels for the first and the second electrons, respectively, at the bridging oxygen site (represented as O B in Fig. 2 ) vacancy O B V sites. E 2 and E 4 are higher than E 1 and E 3 , respectively, because of the need for the extra Coulomb repulsion energy to place the second electron (with opposite spin) at the vacancy site. Unlike the shallow donor level E S , where the electron wave functions have finite extension over multiple lattice spacing, the deep-level electron wave functions are far less extended. This is why the Coulomb repulsion is important, and the levels for the first and second electrons in such deep vacancy levels are considered to be different. 27 Various transitions with the energy of the emitted photons are denoted in Fig. 7 . Herein, E 2 − E 1 = 0.32 eV, and E 4 − E 3 = 0.31 eV. These differences are roughly the Coulomb repulsion energy, which has been discussed above. The transitions from E S → E 1 and E S → E 3 occur when the bridging and the in-plane ‘O’ vacancy sites have no electrons. Hence, electrons with any spin ↑ (up) or ↓ (down) from E S can come down with equal probability. The presence of an external magnetic field has no effect on these transition probabilities. However, the transitions from E S → E 2 and E S → E 4 occur when the bridging and planar O vacancy sites have already one electron. An external magnetic field polarizes the existing electrons in ( E 2 , E 4 ) levels along its direction (↑). This prevents the transition of an ↑ spin electron from E S to ( E 2 , E 4 ). In other words, an external magnetic field will suppress the number of transitions from E S → E 2 and E S → E 4 , with emitted photon energies of 1.97 and 2.12 eV. Because the total number of emitted photons is conserved, there will be a corresponding rise in the emitted PL intensity in the E S → E 1 and E S → E 3 transitions at energies of 2.28 and 2.44 eV. The origin of the peak at 1.84 eV is not clear to us. It may be due to some kind of defect complexes related to a hydroxyl or oxygenated species. 28 The intensity of the peak, however, does not systematically vary with functionalization or with the application of a magnetic field ( Table 1 ). This indicates that the defect at 1.84 eV does not take part in the spin-polarization process. Thus, we have not included the electronic transition related to it in the band diagram.

From Soup: 56 This is exactly what was observed in the present experiments. The process of surface functionalization creates extra moments on the surfaces of the particles ( Fig. 2 ). When the planar or bridging oxygen vacancy sites have one electron (with a net spin of 1/2) these vacancy electron moments will have exchange interaction with the surface moment created by functionalization at nearby oxygen sites. This was previously discussed while describing anomalous magnetism in surface-functionalized SnO 2 NPs in the present investigation ( Fig. 3 ). Thus, there will be an effective internal field (coming from the exchange interaction) acting on the planar/bridging vacancy site electron. The situation is exactly the same, as if an external field is applied. This explains why both surface functionalization and an external magnetic field have almost the same effect on the PL transitions ( Fig. 5 ). We assign peaks at 2.77 eV and 2.97 eV to the transitions from the conduction band bottom to the acceptor states, which reside in the region of 0.55–0.7 eV above the valence band top, as also supported by literature. 19,27 An interesting finding in the present studies is that these emitted lines are very faint in pristine SnO 2 NPs, but as the SnO 2 NPs are functionalized with OTS, the intensity in these channels increases substantially ( Fig. 5 ). This fact is correlated with an overall reduction in all transitions in the energy window E < 2.6 eV that was previously discussed. Some Si atoms bond with surface oxygen vacancies (shallow donors) leading to a loss of shallow donor concentrations. This loss, in addition to surface passivation of dangling bonds of SnO 2 surfaces, might be the reason for an overall decrease in PL intensity of all lines at E < 2.6 eV. Because the number of electronic transitions are conserved, this will indicate that there will be a corresponding increase in the transitions that start from the conduction band bottom, i.e. in the energy window E > 2.6 eV. This may be the dominant reason for the considerable increase in PL intensity for E > 2.6 eV after functionalization of the particles. To summarize, we have observed that surface functionalization of SnO 2 NPs by OTS creates unpaired electrons on the surface, carrying a net magnetic moment ( Fig. 3 and discussion therein). From the PL spectra, there are four different kinds of defect-related energy levels within the gap: (1) shallow donor levels (due to surface oxygen vacancy), (2) and (3) deep levels due to oxygen vacancies at bridging and planar sites, and (4) acceptor levels due to metal atom vacancies. Both external magnetic fields and surface functionalization decrease the number of transitions with energies of 1.97 and 2.12 eV and increase transitions with energies of 2.28 and 2.44 eV. All of these phenomena are intimately related to the type of chemical bonding on the surface, which creates the magnetic moment on the surface of the functionalized material.

From Soup: 57 In conclusion, a high magnetic moment was observed in the pristine SnO 2 NPs at room temperature. An anomalous enhancement in the magnetic moment and PL intensity were achieved by surface functionalization with silane (OTS). Changes in the electronic configuration of introducing a large magnetic moment by using the functionalization process are demonstrated using magnetic field-dependent PL studies. Thus, this study demonstrates that a complete understanding of the electronic processes involved in controlling optical properties and in the evolution of the magnetic moment using a suitable functionalization of SnO 2 can lead to the development of promising oxide-based spintronic materials and optoelectronic applications.
