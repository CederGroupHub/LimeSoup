From cou.: 1 Acrylated glyphosate was blended into a model polyolacrylate formulation and copolymerized. The resulting copolymer retains herbicidal activity similar to that of the monomer as indicated by the results of biological tests. No release of biocide from the coating was observed. The potential value of these biologically active acrylic formulations as biofouling compositions has been demonstrated by field trials.

From cou.: 2 Biofouling, the undesired attachment of microorganisms, plants and invertebrates to an underwater surface, represents a major problem for seagoing vessels.1,2 A thick layer of marine organisms that rapidly forms on a ship compromises the speed and manoeuvrability of the vessel which, in turn, increases fuel consumption and results in elevated release of harmful emissions. Biofouling can also enhance metal corrosion3 by seawater as well as promote undesired transport of marine organisms from one ecosystem to another.

From cou.: 3 The prevention of biofouling has been a subject of intense research for hundreds of years.2 Several sequential steps are proposed causal to marine fouling.4,5 Initially, surfaces of submerged objects serve as substrates for thin films of adsorbed organic compounds. Bacteria (including cyanobacteria) can colonize on the surface in hours followed by single cell diatoms that secrete sticky extracellular polymeric substances leading to the formation of a microbial biofilm. The presence of such adhesive residues promotes further attachment of marine microorganisms including larger marine invertebrates (i.e. barnacles, sponges, etc.) and these grow concomitantly with macroalgae such as Enteromorpha.

From cou.: 4 Modern antifouling coating compositions fall into three main categories: contact leaching biocidal coatings,6 self-polishing biocidal coatings,7 and biocide-free foul release coatings.8 The latter are the most promising. However, even the latest foul-release formulations lack efficiency, are expensive, and work only when vessels are in motion.9 A Convention adopted in 2001 by the International Maritime Organization will prohibit, upon ratification by member states, all use of toxic tin-based paint formulations by January 1, 2008.10Copper-containing compositions may also soon be banned. The disadvantage of the leading alternative biocidal coatings is their short service lifetime. The biocide is rapidly depleted because it is generally mechanically blended into the polymer coating matrix.

From cou.: 6 The glyphosate (2), commercially known as Roundup®, is a non-selective systematic phosphonate herbicide. It is an effective inhibitor of the shikimic acid pathway in microorganisms and plants. The target of glyphosate action is 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase, an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of essential aromatic amino acids.11,12 Because EPSP synthase does not exist in mammals and other marine animals, compounds containing the glyphosate functionality could be attractive biocides for antifouling applications. Another important feature is ready degradation of glyphosate by some microorganisms thereby preventing accumulation in the environment.13 Overall, these characteristics may yield a more environmentally sound approach to the development of antifouling coatings.

From cou.: 7 We have recently demonstrated biological activity of 1.14 Because 1 acts as a herbicide, its presence in a coating may impede biofilm formation by preventing attachment of photosynthetic cyanobacteria and diatoms. This, in turn, is expected to prevent the attachment of larger invertebrates. In addition, an acrylic functionality permits chemical incorporation of the biocide into a coating ensuring better control of release rates. This, in turn, is expected to prolong the service lifetime of the coating.

From cou.: 9 Photocopolymerization was carried out by irradiation of ca. 17% solutions of AA and 17% of 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) in D2O in presence of 1.5% wt. of Darocure 1173. Solutions were irradiated in borosilicate glass NMR tubes. The extent of polymerization was monitored by 1H NMR by observing the disappearance of the signals for vinyl hydrogens of AA and HEA. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using Bruker Avance 300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. Sample irradiations were carried out using either an array of 395 nm LEDs from Clearstone Inc. equipped with CF-1000 power supply or with a Rayonet photochemical reactor equipped with the 350 nm lamps.

From cou.: 10 Model acrylic resin (designated as 459S2) containing several epoxy acrylic oligomers (57%), acrylic monomeric diluents (43%) and a corresponding amount of herbicide was used to make rectangular copolymer pellets (15 × 10 × 1.5 mm). A designated quantity of herbicide was dispersed or partially dissolved in 459S2 resin using ultrasonication and heat (60 °C, overnight). Photoinitiator (ITX, 1.5% wt.), ODAB synergist (5% wt.) and co-photoinitiator (Irgacure 819, 0.1% wt.) were added to formulations. Formulations were poured into an open top Teflon mold and irradiated under N2 by a 395 nm LED light source (5 min) to produce photopolymer pellet.

From cou.: 11 Round copolymer pellets (d = 5 mm, h = 2 mm) were formed from a 459S2 resin and a proper amount of herbicide. Liquid formulations (1 g) were loaded with 2.4%, 3.2%, and 6% wt. of acrylated glyphosate or 1.6%, 2.4% and 5% wt. of glyphosate. To each sample, 1.5% wt. of Irgacure 819 was added. The formulations were poured into a plastic mold and irradiated at 350 nm (Rayonet) under N2 for 5 min. The resulting pellets were placed in 1 ml of D2O and kept on a shaker (100 rpm) for 20 days. The amount of herbicide released was periodically monitored by observing the 1H NMR of pellets washings. Peak intensities from standard glyphosate and N-acryloyl-N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine D2O solutions (containing herbicide amounts identical to the loads in the pellets) were used to normalize the amount of herbicide released.

From cou.: 12 Two different diatom cultures, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Navicula pelliculosa were used in the biological activity tests. Polymer pellets loaded with different concentrations (0.1, 0.15, and 0.3M) of glyphosate and acrylated glyphosate were placed on Petri plates loaded with a layer of f/2-containing agar medium (1.5% wt., 10 ml, see electronic supplementary information, ESI§) and a layer of f/2-containing low melting agarose medium (0.8% wt., previously seeded with diatoms (6 × 106 and 2 × 107cell ml−1, respectively). Following propagation over 5 days under continuous cool fluorescent light (40 micromol photons m−2 s−1), the average radii of inhibition zones were measured. Experiments for each herbicide concentration were repeated at least two times. Pellets comprised of model resin 459S2 without glyphosate additives were used as controls.

From cou.: 13 Field tests were conducted during July and August, 2006 at the University of Michigan Biological Station Experimental Stream Laboratory located near Douglas Lake, Pellston, Michigan. Resin 459S2 containing 0.15M of a designated herbicide was coated on terracotta ceramic tiles (3 × 6 inches) pretreated with silanes for improved adhesion and photocured by a H-bulb system from Fusion Inc. The coating thickness was 12.5 μm (0.5 ml). Bare tiles and tiles coated with 459S2 containing no additive were used as controls. Nine tiles for each series were placed into separate flow channels with a constant water flow of 3 L min−1 for each channel. Each flow channel utilized water pumped from the East Branch of the Maple River containing natural freshwater biofouling organisms. Each flow channel was covered with a mesh screen to reduce direct light exposure and to ensure more favorable growth conditions. Tiles were left in the flow channels for 10 days.

From Soup: 18 In our previous report, 14 we showed that both the monomer and homopolymer of N -acryloyl- N -(phosphonomethyl) glycine, AA, exhibited biological activity. In this work, AA was copolymerized with 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA). AA conversion was complete in a short period of time upon 350 nm irradiation of a D 2 O solution. When a mixture of AA and HEA was subjected to a similar irradiation, the monomer conversion observed for copolymerization was as fast as in the case of a solo AA ( Fig. 1 ).

From Soup: 19 Additional copolymerization experiments were conducted. To the mixtures listed in Table S1, § 1.5% w/w of Darocur 1173 was added. The resulting mixtures were spin-coated on glass slides followed by irradiation at 350 nm. All resulting films adhered to the slides. The combination of AA with HEA resulted in tougher and less brittle films. Quantitative measurements of the film properties, however, were not pursued.

From Soup: 20 To test the biological activity of AA incorporated into the acrylic formulation, we adapted as a model the acrylic matrix (less all pigments) from a commercial anticorrosion marine paint. 16 Two diatom strains were used in these experiments because of their known roles as precursors for marine biofouling. 17 Similar observations were made for both diatom strains tested ( Table 1 ). When the acrylic resin contained no herbicide , inhibition of diatom growth was minimal. Incorporation of similar molar amounts of non-functionalized glyphosate and acrylated glyphosate into a model resin resulted in either substantial growth inhibition or complete bleaching in the case of high herbicide concentrations. This was observed for both non-functionalized and functionalized glyphosates despite their different arrangements within the coating. The former was a (poly)acrylic matrix with glyphosate particles trapped in the pores while the latter was a copolymer where acrylated glyphosate was chemically incorporated into the polymer backbone.

From Soup: 21 These structural differences were reflected in the rates of release of the active component from the coating ( Fig. 2 ). While about 94% of loaded non-functionalized glyphosate was depleted from the coating after 18 days of shaking in D 2 O, no release of AA (or products of AA decomposition ) was detected by NMR over the same period. In the case of AA copolymer , the glyphosate functionality is chemically incorporated into a polymer preventing its release. However, the resulting polymer still demonstrates significant biological activity. This highlights the excellent antifouling and herbicidal potential of AA containing coatings.

From Soup: 22 Absorption spectra of acetone -extracted pigments ( Fig. 3 ) show the dominant pigment present to be chl a (peaks at 435 and 663 nm). Transformation of the data to yield a second derivative spectrum also indicated the presence of absorbing species at 468 and 645 nm, suggestive of chl b , and 455 and 630 nm, indicative of chl c. These data suggest that the major taxa adhering to the tiles were likely cyanobacteria (containing only chl a ), green algae (containing both chl a and b ), and diatoms (containing chl a and c ). The presence of diatoms as a major member of the stream facility biota has been described previously. 18

From Soup: 23 Total chl extracted from bare uncoated tiles established a baseline for attachment with 11.1 ± 2.87 μg tile −1 ( Fig. 3 , inset). Blank tiles coated with resin containing no herbicide and tiles containing unfunctionalized glyphosate yielded periphyton chl biomass of 9.35 ± 1.07 μg tile −1 and 11.9 ± 2.56 μg tile −1 , respectively (one way analysis of variance, P > 0.05, df = 17). The lack of inhibition by unfunctionalized glyphosate can be justified using our release data. Glyphosate , when chemically unbound, rapidly leaches out of the coating. Further, this leaching is expected to create porosity on a coated surface promoting attachment of microorganisms. 19 Blank tiles display some inhibition owing to toxicity of acrylic coating components. Finally, the composition containing AA embedded into the polymer backbone yielded the least amount of attached biomatter (7.92 ± 1.12 μg tile −1 ), roughly two-thirds of the periphyton chl measured from tiles containing unfunctionalized glyphosate (unpaired two-tailed t -test, P < 0.05) and thus, supporting the good potential of AA as a biocide.
