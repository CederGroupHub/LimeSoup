From cou.: 1 A refined cluster-in-molecule (CIM) method for local correlation calculations of large molecules is presented. In the present work, two new strategies are introduced to further improve the CIM approach: (1) Some medium-range electron correlation energies, which are neglected in the previous CIM approach, are taken into account. (2) A much simpler procedure using only a distance threshold is used to construct various clusters. To cover the medium-range correlation effect as much as possible, some two-atom-centered clusters are built, in addition to one-atom-centered clusters. Our test calculations at the second order perturbation theory (MP2) level show that the refined CIM method can recover about 99.9% of the conventional MP2 correlation energy using an appropriate distance threshold. The accuracy of the present CIM method is capable of providing reliable relative energies of medium-sized systems such as polyalanines with 10 residues, and water molecules with 50 water molecules. For polyalanines with up to 30 residues, we have demonstrated that the computational cost of the CIM-MP2 calculation increases linearly with the molecular size, but the required memory and disc-space do not need to increase for large systems. The improved CIM method has been used to compute the relative energy of ice-like (H2O)96 clusters (with 2400 basis functions) and to predict the dimerization energy of a double-helical foldamer (with 2330 basis functions). The present CIM method is expected to be a practical local correlation method for describing the relative energies of large systems.

From cou.: 2 The traditional size-extensive electron correlation methods, such as Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP) and coupled cluster (CC) methods, have been successfully used to calculate the energies and molecular properties of small and medium-sized molecules. However, the computational cost required by these methods increases steeply with the molecular size, preventing their applications to large molecules. For example, the second-order MP (MP2) scales as N5, where N is the number of electrons or basis functions, coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) scales as N6. In addition, the memory and disk requirements also increase rapidly with the molecular size. The steep scaling of MP and CC methods are due to the use of canonical molecular orbitals (CMOs) in the calculations. In order to achieve low or linear scaling electron correlation calculations, a number of algorithms based on the localized molecular orbitals (LMOs) and atomic orbitals (AOs) have been developed.1–30 The underlying principle of this category of methods is that the electron pair correlation energy decays rapidly with the distance between LMOs or AOs.

From cou.: 3 In general, there are four types of local correlation methods, base on the types of orbitals used in occupied and virtual spaces. (1) The first local correlation method was proposed very early by Pulay1 and implemented by Pulay and co-workers for MP2-MP4(SDQ)2–6 and coupled-electron pair approximation (CEPA) methods.7,8 Later, this method was generalized by Werner and co-workers for the CCSD and CCSD(T) methods.9–11 In this method, the occupied and unoccupied spaces are represented as orthogonal LMOs and nonorthogonal projects AOs (PAOs), respectively. This method has been demonstrated to achieve linear scaling for large systems, and its efficient implementation has allowed routine applications to become possible. (2) Scuseria and Ayala developed a AO-based local correlation method,12 in which AOs are used in both occupied and unoccupied spaces. Based on the locality of integrals and CC (or MP) amplitudes within the AO basis, the computational cost can also scale linearly with the molecular size. Another local MP2 method, based on the AO–Laplace transform MP2, was also implemented by Scuseria and Ayala.13 (3) The third type of local correlation methods, in which a redundant set of unorthogonal PAOs are used in both occupied and unoccupied spaces, was proposed by Head-Gordon and co-workers14–17 and extended by other groups.18,19 (4) Another type of local correlation methods, in which both the occupied and unoccupied spaces are represented as orthogonal LMOs, was first suggested by Forner, Ladik, Otto, and Cizek,20,21 and significantly refined by us.22–24 The benefit for using LMOs is that the CC or MP equations are almost the same as the conventional equations so that the existing programs can be directly employed. The original ideas proposed by Forner and co-workers did not produce accurate correlation energies, unlike other local correlation methods. In 2002, we proposed a practical approach, cluster-in-molecule (CIM) method,22 to allow the accuracy of this type of method to be competitive with other local correlation methods. Then this algorithm was further developed by us23–26 and other groups.27,28 Different from the CIM method, Stoll developed an incremental scheme for the correlation calculations of periodic systems,31,32 which was further extended by Dolg and co-worker to molecules and clusters.33,34 In this method, the total correlation energy of a large system is expanded as the sum of correlation contributions from singles, pairs, triples, etc., of local domains, which can be obtained from correlation calculations on local domains. Thus, the ways of constructing local domains and evaluating the total correlation energy in the incremental scheme differ from those in the CIM method.

From cou.: 4 The principle of the CIM approach is that significant amplitudes can be approximately calculated from calculations on a cluster containing a subset of orthogonal occupied and unoccupied LMOs.35–37 By truncating occupied and unoccupied LMOs within each cluster, one can achieve linear scaling CIM correlation calculations for large systems. An important difference between CIM and other local correlation methods is that the required memory and disc-space do not increase with the system size. This advantage allows the CIM method to be applicable to very large systems as long as correlation calculations on each cluster can be performed. Recently, the CIM method was extended to the CCSD and CCSD with noniterative triples, including CCSD(T) and a completely renormalized CR-CC(2,3) approach.24 A significant improvement is that quasi-canonical MOs (QCMOs) are introduced to simplify the solutions of electron correlation equations for some methods like CCSD(T). Other improvements have also been introduced to simplify the construction of various clusters.25 The multi-level extension of the CIM method enables one to combine different quantum chemistry methods to treat different regions in a large molecule.26 For example, we can treat the reaction center with high-order CC methods and the remaining part with the MP2 method or low-order CC methods. In addition, Rolik and Kallay implemented a CIM based CC method,28 in which the approximate MP2 natural orbitals (NOs) are used to construct the environment orbitals and virtual orbitals for each LMO. The use of NOs may reduce the computational cost of high-order CC calculations. However, the cost of this algorithm still scales as N5, since the full two-electron integral transformation from AOs to MOs is required. Mazziotti and co-workers developed a CIM based linear scaling parametric variational two-electron reduced-density-matrix (CIM-2-RDM) method.27 It should be mentioned that in the divide-expand-consolidate (DEC) method by Ziolkowski and co-workers,29,30 the CC calculations are also performed in a series of clusters based on occupied and unoccupied LMOs. Then the total correlation energy is expressed as the sum of atomic fragment energies and the pair fragment interaction energies, which are composed of intra- and inter-orbital correlation energies on atomic sites. Thus, this method may be considered as a CIM-like method.

From cou.: 5 In recent years, a number of fragment-based methods have also been proposed for electron correlation calculations of large molecules.38–48 Some fragment-based methods including an energy-based fragmentation approach,38–40 a divide-and-conquer approach,41–46 and a fragment molecular orbital approach47,48 have been demonstrated to provide quite accurate results for systems with localized electrons. In these methods, a target molecule is first divided in to a series of fragments and then various subsystems are constructed by adding either some capping atoms or some localized orbitals to some fragments for valence saturation. Then the total energies can be obtained by assembling the energies of all subsystems. This type of method is generally applicable at the Hartree–Fock (HF) and post-HF levels. The main difference between the CIM and fragment-based approaches is that clusters constructed in the CIM approach contains only a subset of LMOs, and the fragmentation of a large molecule into fragments is not explicitly needed. Thus, the CIM approach should find wider applications than fragment-based approaches, while the latter need the fragmentation of a large molecule into fragments connected by single covalent bonds or hydrogen bonds.

From cou.: 12 In the original CIM work,22,23 the essential steps for building clusters are: (1) For each occupied LMO (central orbital), the primary environmental occupied orbitals are added, if the Fock matrix elements between those orbitals and the central orbital are larger than a threshold ζ1, to form a primitive MO domain. Then, some secondary environmental occupied orbitals are added to the primitive MO domain by using another threshold ζ2 to obtain the final MO domain. (2) The cluster AO domain for each MO domain is constructed by combining the AO domains for all occupied LMOs within the MO domain. The AO domain for each LMO is formed by gradually selecting the atoms, which are ranked according to the decreasing Mulliken orbital charges, until the sum of Mulliken orbital charges at selected atoms exceed a threshold ζ3 (1.98 as usual). (3) For each cluster AO domain, an expanded AO domain is built by adding buffer atoms in the neighbouring surroundings of the AO domain (using a distance threshold ζ4). Then, an expanded MO domain is constructed by adding some occupied LMOs (including core orbitals), in each of which the sum of Mulliken orbital charges within the expanded AO domain is larger than ζ3. (4) The orthogonal unoccupied MOs for each expanded MO domain are constructed from the expansion of the projected basis functions within the expanded AO domain. (5) Pick up the unoccupied LMOs within the cluster AO domain after localizing all unoccupied MOs within the expanded AO domain. (6) Combine the MO domain in the step (1) with the resulting unoccupied LMOs described above to form a cluster.

From cou.: 13 In the subsequent development24 of the CIM method, a significant improvement is to transform LMOs in each cluster into quasi-canonical MOs (QCMOs) by an unitary transformation RT, which is obtained by digonalizing the occupied and unoccupied block of the Fock matrix separately. The purpose of introducing this transformation is to avoid the iterative solutions of equations for excitation amplitude in some electron correlation methods. For example, with the QCMOs, the MP2 amplitudes can be directly obtained without iteratively solving the corresponding equations. The use of the QCMOs in solving the CC equations can also lead to a faster convergence, speeding up the calculations. If the QCMOs are employed in the calculations on various clusters, the correlation energy contribution for a given LMO i′ can be obtained as follows (for MP2 and CCSD):

From cou.: 17 In this work, two strategies are introduced to further improve the CIM approach. On one hand, some medium-range electron correlation energies neglected in the previous CIM approach are taken into account. These additional medium-range correlation energies are critical, especially for large molecules, because there are numerous such terms in large molecules with compact structures. On the other hand, a simple distance threshold is used to construct various clusters, while the construction of clusters in previous works22–26 relies on the Fock matrix element between orbitals.

The smallest distance between any two atoms in two groups is considered as a distance between two groups. For dodecane, we define 12 atomic groups, each of which contains a CH3– or –CH2– group [solid circles in Fig. 1(a)].

The union of LMOs assigned to any atoms in an atomic group is defined as an orbital group.

From cou.: 21 (3) For each orbital group, add its neighboring orbital groups within a distance threshold ξ to build an one-atom-centered primitive MO domain. For simplicity, we use the distance between two atomic groups as the corresponding orbital group distance. Fig. 1(c) and (d) show two primitive MO domains derived from the first and third orbital groups in dodecane. The orbital groups in solid ellipses are called central orbital groups and the orbital groups in dashed ellipses are called environmental orbital groups.

From cou.: 22 (4) If a small primitive MO domain is entirely embedded in a large one, the small one will be eliminated. Then, the central orbital groups in the large one is redefined to contain all central groups in these two MO domains. By repeating this process, one can derive a set of irreducible MO domains. These MO domains are named as one-atom-centered domains. Fig. 1(f) shows one irreducible one-atom-centered MO domain for dodecane.

From cou.: 23 (5) Besides one-atom-centered domains, one can also build some two-atom-centered domains to incorporate more medium-range correlation. For example, Fig. 1(g) shows such a two-atom-centered domain constructed for incorporation of the inter-group interaction between groups 1 and 6. These two groups 1 and 6 do not occur simultaneously in any one-atom-centered domain, but their distance is less than a threshold ζ (6 Å as default). Using the middle point [see Fig. 1(g)] between two atomic groups as the origin, the environmental orbital groups [orbital groups in dashed ellispes in Fig. 1(g)] within a threshold ζ/2 will be added to form a two-atom-centered domain.

These two groups 1 and 6 do not occur simultaneously in any one-atom-centered domain, but their distance is less than a threshold ζ (6 Å as default). Using the middle point [see Fig. 1(g) ] between two atomic groups as the origin, the environmental orbital groups [orbital groups in dashed ellispes in Fig. 1(g) ] within a threshold ζ/2 will be added to form a two-atom-centered domain.

The two terms represent some of the correlation effect in the medium range ( ξ < d < 6 Å, d is the group–group distance).

From Soup: 70 In this section, the refined CIM approach is applied to compute the relative energies of some medium-size and large systems at the MP2 level. For some systems, the conventional MP2 calculations are performed to validate the accuracy of the improved CIM approach. Then the CIM-MP2 method has been applied to study the relative energies of two large systems with more than 2000 basis functions, which are not accessible with the conventional MP2 method. For these two systems, we will compare our CIM-MP2 results with those from B3LYP and M06-2X results, or GEBF-MP2 results. In this work, the conventional HF and MP2 calculations, one and two-electron integrals over atomic basis functions and their MO-based integrals for CIM-MP2 calculations of various “clusters” are carried with the GAMESS package. 50 The GEBF results are obtained with the LSQC program. 51 The B3LYP and M06-2X calculations and the MP2 calculations of subsystems are performed with the GAUSSIAN 09 package. 52 All calculations were carried on workstations equipped with two quad-core Intel Xeon 2.66 GHz CPUs.

From Soup: 71 In order to validate the accuracy of the improved CIM approach, we compare the CIM-MP2 results with the conventional MP2 results for three conformers of acetyl(ala) 10 NH 2 (β-strand, 3 10 -helix, and α-helix) and three structures of a water cluster, (H 2 O) 50 . The results obtained with the 6-31G** (or 6-311G**) basis set are collected in Table 1 .
 ###### 
From cou.: 72 i
From Soup: 72 For the three structures of acetyl(ala) 10 NH 2 ((ala) 10 in short), one can see that more than 99.4% of the total correlation energy can be obtained for both CIM(3.5) and CIM(4.0) calculations. For CIM(3.5) calculations, the ratio of the CIM-MP2 correlation energy to the conventional MP2 value in the β-strand is larger than those in 3 10 -helix and α-helix because some medium-range correlation interactions in helical structures are neglected. The CIM(3.5)-MP2 calculations predict the relative energies of 3 10 -helix and α-helix (with respect to β-strand) to be −26.13 and −30.39 kcal mol −1 , respectively, which deviate significantly from the conventional MP2 values (−40.55 and −42.72 kcal mol −1 ). Thus, ξ = 3.5 is not accurate enough for quantitative prediction of the relative energies among these three structures. For CIM(4.0) calculations, for all the three structures about 99.9% of their conventional MP2 correlation energies can be obtained, and the relative energies of 3 10 -helix and α-helix (relative to β-strand) are predicted to be −40.78 and −41.66 kcal mol −1 , respectively, which are very close to the conventional MP2 results.
 ###### 
From cou.: 73 ε
From Soup: 73 For the three structures of (H 2 O) 50 with the 6-31G** basis set, the CIM-MP2 method can reproduce about 99.8% (or 99.9%) of the conventional MP2 correlation energy with ξ = 3.0 (or 3.5). The relative energies from CIM-MP2 with both ξ = 3.0 and ξ = 3.5 agree very well with those from the conventional MP2 calculation, although energy differences among these isomers are small. For instance, the CIM(3.5)-MP2 method predicts the relative energies of the isomers II and III (relative to the structure I) to be −2.94 and −2.09 kcal mol −1 , respectively, which agree well with −2.81 and −1.81 kcal mol −1 from the conventional MP2 calculations. It should be mentioned that even with ξ = 3.5, the largest “cluster” only contains 375 basis functions (which corresponds to 15 water molecules). For these three isomers, we also perform calculations with a larger basis set (6-311G**). The relative stability of these three isomers are also correctly predicted by the CIM-MP2 method, the deviations between CIM and conventional MP2 calculations are only slightly larger than those at the 6-31G** basis set.
 ###### 
From cou.: 74 i
From Soup: 74 In additional, it can be seen from Table 1 that the extra medium-range electron correlation is important for improving the accuracy of the CIM approach, especially when a small distance threshold is used. For example, for 3 10 -helix and α-helix (ala) 10 , their relative energies (relative to β-strand) are −22.96 and −24.80 kcal mol −1 without the correction of medium-range correlation if ξ = 3.5 is used, which are quite different from the values obtained with the correction of medium-range correlation. Nevertheless, when a larger distance threshold is employed, the magnitude of the extra medium-range correlation becomes relatively smaller. This result is understandable because most of the medium-range correlation is already included in one-atom-centered clusters. However, one can see that without the correction of medium-range correlation, the CIM(4.0)-MP2 relative energies (relative to β-strand) of 3 10 -helix and α-helix (ala) 10 are −41.93 and −40.52 kcal mol −1 , respectively, while the canonical MP2 relative energies predict a reverse order for the stability of these two helical structures. After the correction of the medium-range correlation is added, the correct stability order of these two helical structures is restored by the CIM(4.0)-MP2 calculations. For molecules with complicated three-dimensional structures, one can expect that the correction of medium-range correlation is essential for accurate results. The results described above show that ξ = 3.5 is enough for hydrogen-bonded water clusters and ξ = 4.0 is required for chain-like peptides .
 ###### 
From cou.: 75 j
From Soup: 75 To demonstrate the computational scaling of the improved CIM approach, we have performed CIM(4.0)-MP2 calculations for three secondary structures of a series of capped polyalanines, acetyl(ala) n NH 2 ( n = 10, 14, 18, 24, and 30). The required CPU times are listed in Table 2 and plotted in Fig. 2 . In Table 2 , we list the actual CPU time for the canonical MP2 calculation of (ala) 10 and the estimated CPU times for n = 14, 18, 24, and 30 using the O ( N 5 ) scaling of the MP2 method ( N is the number of basis functions). From Fig. 2 , one can see that the CPU time required by CIM-MP2 increases almost linearly with the number of residues for all three secondary structures. For the capped polyalanine with the same number of residues, the computational cost increases from β-strand to 3 10 -helix, and to α-helix, mainly because that the average size of clusters is relatively larger for helical structures. From Table 2 , we can see that the number of the basis functions for the largest cluster in the β-strand, 3 10 -helix, and α-helix are 250, 465, 550, respectively. Also from Table 2 , one can notice that in CIM-MP2 calculations of all capped polyalanines (with up to 30 residues), the required CPU time for the largest cluster is about one hour. Since the MP2 calculation on each cluster can be done independently, the CIM-MP2 calculations for any system under study could be completed within one hour if enough processors can be employed to run the calculations. It can be noted from Table 2 that the number of basis functions in the largest cluster almost does not change with increasing the number of residues. This result indicates that the memory and disk space required by the CIM approach will not necessarily increase for even larger systems. Thus, the CIM approach can achieve linear scaling for large systems and could become a practical theoretical tool for MP2 (or CCSD) calculations of systems with hundreds of atoms.

From Soup: 76 In this subsection, we apply the improved CIM-MP2 approach to compute the relative energy between two ice-like water clusters including 96 molecules (with 2400 basis functions), denoted as Ih-(H 2 O) 96 and Ic-(H 2 O) 96 , and the dimerization energy of a double-helical foldamer (with 2330 basis functions). The structures of the two ice-like water clusters, the double-helical foldamer W based on aromatic oligoamides and its single-helical monomer are shown in Fig. 3 . In CIM-MP2 calculations, the distance threshold ξ = 3.5 is used for water clusters, and ξ = 4.5 for the foldamer W and its monomers. The relative energies computed with CIM-MP2, together with those from B3LYP, M06-2X, and GEBF(4.0)-MP2 35 (for (H 2 O) 96 ), are collected in Table 3 .
 ###### 
From cou.: 77 ab
From Soup: 77 From Table 3 , one can see that all methods predict the Ih-(H 2 O) 96 to be more stable than Ic-(H 2 O) 96 . However, the relative energies between them are predicted to be quite different by different methods. Encouragingly, the CIM-MP2 relative energy, 256.7 kcal mol −1 , is in good agreement with the GEBF-MP2 result. Since the GEBF method has been demonstrated to be very accurate for water clusters, 35 the good agreement between CIM-MP2 and GEBF-MP2 results shows that the CIM(3.5)-MP2 method can provide a reliable prediction on the relative energies between water clusters. Nevertheless, the large difference between the B3LYP or M06-2X result and the CIM-MP2 result indicates that the applicability of the B3LYP or M06-2X method to hydrogen-bond water molecules should be further validated. It is worth noticing that the number of basis functions in the largest cluster is only 250, which corresponds to 10 water molecules.
 ###### 
From cou.: 78 ij
From Soup: 78 For the double-helical foldamer W, which is mainly formed by stacking interactions between two single-helical monomers, we are interested in the dimerization energy to form this foldamer, which is defined as E dimer − 2 E monomer (without BSSE correction). From Table 3 , one can see that the dimerization energy calculated with M06-2X and CIM-MP2 methods is −42.8 and −30.2 kcal mol −1 , respectively. The large negative dimerization energy is consistent with the experimental fact that two single-helical monomers can form the foldamer W. Since M06-2X has proven to be quite accurate in describing the van der Waals (vdW) interaction, 53–55 one can infer that the CIM(4.5)-MP2 method provide reasonable descriptions on the dimerization energy. Nevertheless, the B3LYP method fails in this case. The reason is due to the lack of the vdW interactions, 56,57 which is the driving force to form a double-helical foldamer.

From cou.: 79 t
From Soup: 79 We have presented a refined CIM method for local correlation calculations of large systems. In comparison with the previous CIM implementation, two new strategies have been introduced to further improve the accuracy and simplify the procedure. The main modification is to add some medium-range electron correlation energies, which are neglected in the previous treatment. The second modification is to build various clusters in a much simpler way. By assigning all the occupied LMOs uniquely to a set of atomic groups, various clusters can be constructed by simply using a distance threshold. To cover medium-range electron correlation as much as possible, some two-atom centered clusters are built, in addition to one-atom-center clusters. Our illustrative calculations at the MP2 level show that the refined CIM method can recover more correlation energy than the previous CIM scheme without significantly increasing the computational cost. The accuracy of the present CIM method is capable of providing reliable relative energies of large systems. From CIM-MP2 calculations on β-strand, 3 10 -helix, and α-helix structures of capped polyalanines with up to 30 residues (more than 3000 basis functions), one can see that the linear scaling of the present CIM method can be achieved. The refined CIM method has been used to compute the relative energy of ice-like water clusters (with 96 water molecules) and the dimerization energy of a double-helical foldamer W (with 2330 basis functions). The good agreement between the CIM-MP2 results and other approaches indicates that the present CIM method will become a practical local correlation method for large or even very large systems. In the near future, we will implement the present CIM method at other theoretical levels, such as CCSD, CCSD(T), and CR-CC(2,3), etc.

The relative energies computed with CIM-MP2, together with those from B3LYP, M06-2X, and GEBF(4.0)-MP235 (for (H2O)96), are collected in Table 3.

From cou.: 91 From Table 3, one can see that all methods predict the Ih-(H2O)96 to be more stable than Ic-(H2O)96. However, the relative energies between them are predicted to be quite different by different methods. Encouragingly, the CIM-MP2 relative energy, 256.7 kcal mol−1, is in good agreement with the GEBF-MP2 result. Since the GEBF method has been demonstrated to be very accurate for water clusters,35 the good agreement between CIM-MP2 and GEBF-MP2 results shows that the CIM(3.5)-MP2 method can provide a reliable prediction on the relative energies between water clusters. Nevertheless, the large difference between the B3LYP or M06-2X result and the CIM-MP2 result indicates that the applicability of the B3LYP or M06-2X method to hydrogen-bond water molecules should be further validated. It is worth noticing that the number of basis functions in the largest cluster is only 250, which corresponds to 10 water molecules.

From cou.: 92 For the double-helical foldamer W, which is mainly formed by stacking interactions between two single-helical monomers, we are interested in the dimerization energy to form this foldamer, which is defined as Edimer − 2Emonomer (without BSSE correction). From Table 3, one can see that the dimerization energy calculated with M06-2X and CIM-MP2 methods is −42.8 and −30.2 kcal mol−1, respectively. The large negative dimerization energy is consistent with the experimental fact that two single-helical monomers can form the foldamer W. Since M06-2X has proven to be quite accurate in describing the van der Waals (vdW) interaction,53–55 one can infer that the CIM(4.5)-MP2 method provide reasonable descriptions on the dimerization energy. Nevertheless, the B3LYP method fails in this case. The reason is due to the lack of the vdW interactions,56,57 which is the driving force to form a double-helical foldamer.

From cou.: 93 We have presented a refined CIM method for local correlation calculations of large systems. In comparison with the previous CIM implementation, two new strategies have been introduced to further improve the accuracy and simplify the procedure. The main modification is to add some medium-range electron correlation energies, which are neglected in the previous treatment. The second modification is to build various clusters in a much simpler way. By assigning all the occupied LMOs uniquely to a set of atomic groups, various clusters can be constructed by simply using a distance threshold. To cover medium-range electron correlation as much as possible, some two-atom centered clusters are built, in addition to one-atom-center clusters. Our illustrative calculations at the MP2 level show that the refined CIM method can recover more correlation energy than the previous CIM scheme without significantly increasing the computational cost. The accuracy of the present CIM method is capable of providing reliable relative energies of large systems. From CIM-MP2 calculations on β-strand, 310-helix, and α-helix structures of capped polyalanines with up to 30 residues (more than 3000 basis functions), one can see that the linear scaling of the present CIM method can be achieved. The refined CIM method has been used to compute the relative energy of ice-like water clusters (with 96 water molecules) and the dimerization energy of a double-helical foldamer W (with 2330 basis functions). The good agreement between the CIM-MP2 results and other approaches indicates that the present CIM method will become a practical local correlation method for large or even very large systems. In the near future, we will implement the present CIM method at other theoretical levels, such as CCSD, CCSD(T), and CR-CC(2,3), etc.
