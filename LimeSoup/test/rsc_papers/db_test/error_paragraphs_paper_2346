From cou.: 1 The disruption of protein hydroxylation is highly associated with several serious diseases and consequently the identification of protein hydroxylation sites has attracted significant attention recently. Here, we report the development of an improved method, called HydPred, to identify protein hydroxylation sites (hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine) based on the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE), the random forest (RF) algorithm and four blocks of newly composed features that are derived from the protein primary sequence. The HydPred method achieved the best prediction performance reported until now with Matthew's correlation coefficient values of 0.770 and 0.857 for hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, respectively, according to jack-knife cross-validation. This represents an improvement of 8% for hydroxyproline and 19% for hydroxylysine compared to the best results of available predictors. The prediction performance of HydPred for the external validation of hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine was also improved compared with other published methods. We subsequently applied HydPred to study the association of disruption of hydroxylation sites with human inherited disease. The analyses suggested that the loss of hydroxylation sites is more likely to cause disease instead of the gain of hydroxylation sites and 52 different human inherited diseases were found to be highly associated with the loss of hydroxylation sites. Therefore, HydPred represents a new strategy to discover the molecular basis of pathogenesis associated with abnormal hydroxylation. HydPred is now available online as a user-friendly web server at http://lishuyan.lzu.edu.cn/hydpred/.

From cou.: 2 Protein hydroxylation is a chemical process that introduces a hydroxyl group (–OH) into residues. The principal hydroxylated residue is proline, forming hydroxyproline and the minor hydroxylated residue is lysine, forming hydroxylysine. Hydroxylation plays several critical roles in biological systems, e.g. it is crucial for the assembly of collagen and other extracellular matrix components.1 It modulates the function of estrogen,2 regulates cellular oxygen sensing through hypoxia-inducible pathways,3 and hence, creates neuroprotection.4 Correspondingly, the disruption of protein hydroxylation was discovered to be associated with a number of serious human diseases, such as osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease),5 osteoporosis,6 nervous system tumours,7 kidney disease,3 breast cancer2 and other hormone-related or hypoxia-related cancers.8–10 Therefore, the identification of protein hydroxylation sites and hence the annotation of hydroxylation in proteomes have attracted recent attention. For this goal, mass spectrometry (MS) related methods achieved some success,11,12 but this approach is always time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, the data produced by MS are also biased toward abundant proteins and prototypic peptides since they were frequently studied. Considering the explosive increase in protein data, computational methods emerged as a promising tool for the first round annotation of hydroxylation sites.

From cou.: 3 Several predictors were already created for the identification of hydroxylation sites. The first predictor was proposed by Yang's group, which directly targeted collagen hydroxyproline sites by support vector machines.13 Later, this work was expanded on both hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine by Hu et al. using a more comprehensive dataset that was extracted from UniProt/Swiss-Prot, which are cross-species and contain different protein types.14 They utilized the nearest neighbor algorithm and 6345 features that were derived from the protein primary sequence. However, the final performance was merely adequate, with Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) values of 0.461 and 0.592 for hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine sites, respectively. Then, a predictor called iHyd-PseAAC was presented by Xu et al. based on the dipeptide position-specific propensity of pseudo amino acid composition.15 Although this work led to the first online web server for the identification of hydroxylation sites, the MCC values achieved for hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine of this predictor were both only approximately 0.50. Soon afterwards, Shi et al.15 described a new hydroxylation prediction method called PredHydroxy, based on the position weight amino acid composition and 8 high-quality amino acid indices. In this method, the MCC values for the first time showed a remarkable increase, up to 0.667 and 0.690 for hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, respectively. However, to create a reliable hydroxylation site annotation tool for newly discovered protein data, this prediction performance still needs more improvement.

From cou.: 4 To achieve this goal, we are proposing a new in silico method called HydPred, based on the RF algorithm16 and the four categories of newly composed features that are derived from protein sequence information. These features were calculated from the amino acid composition, the autocorrelation of amino acid physicochemical properties, the amino acid position weighted matrices and the amino acid binary localization encoding. The SMOTE method17 was utilized here to fix the data unbalancing problem. Based on the extracted features, the final identification performance of HydPred was greatly improved compared with the best results of previously published predictors. How this method was developed is illustrated in Fig. 1. Our validated HydPred method was then applied to analyze differences in the hydroxylation of protein variants associated with human inherited diseases that could underlie disease pathologies.

From cou.: 5 The hydroxylation data were assembled from Swiss-Prot (Release: 2014-09), which is currently the most comprehensive dataset of hydroxylation data. Here, only the experimentally verified information was extracted by searching ‘hydroxyproline’ or ‘hydroxylysine’ in the field ‘modified residue’ in the text format of the SwissProt dataset. The data with an annotation confidence of ‘probable’, ‘potential’, or ‘by similarity’ were excluded. If the proteins from different species have the same sequence and different hydroxylation entries, these entries were assembled to a unique protein sequence as non-redundant entries. Therefore, following these steps, 1031 hydroxyproline sites from 206 unique proteins and 127 hydroxylysine sites from 33 unique proteins were extracted.

From cou.: 6 A peptide fragment of 13 amino acids in length, which was centered on proline or lysine with 6 upstream and 6 downstream amino acids, was represented as a study sample. Because there is physical evidence of kinase-substrate binding within neighborhood residues of the modification site,16 we believe that the prolyl-hydroxylases/lysyl-hydroxylases will likely recognize residues surrounding the modification site as well. Taking hydroxyproline as an example, the fragment that was centered by a proline that had a hydroxylation entry was treated as positive sample, and the fragments that were centered by non-hydroxylated prolines were treated as negative samples. The length of 13 is commonly used in previous predictors for hydroxylation site identification,15,18 therefore, we also used this length. All of the redundancy entries within the same sequence were integrated into a unique sample. Since most of the positive samples of hydroxylation shared high sequence identities, we believe that there should be several conserved sites existing inside the sample sequence which are very important for the binding of prolyl-hydroxylases/lysyl-hydroxylases. Therefore, instead of roughly removing the redundant samples according to a certain percent of sequence identity, only the identical hydroxylation samples were removed from the database to avoid the pre-introduced bias.

From cou.: 7 Meanwhile, the negative samples that either had the same sequence with positive samples or had a non-experimental annotation confidence of ‘probable’, ‘potential’, or ‘by similarity’ for hydroxylation sites were also eliminated from the negative sets in order to obtain a rigorous dataset. Then, 825 positive and 2600 negative samples were obtained for hydroxyproline, while 121 positive and 937 negative samples remained for hydroxylysine.

From cou.: 8 Lastly, to rigorously validate the prediction performance, the protein set was randomly divided into a cross-validation training set and an external validation set by a ratio of approximately 9 to 1 on the protein level to avoid intra-protein bias. It was rounded towards plus infinity for the protein number in the external validation set for both hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine. Thus, 21 proteins with 55 positive samples and 165 negative samples were split into the external validation set of hydroxyproline, and 4 proteins with 12 positive samples and 169 negative samples were split into the external validation set for hydroxylysine. The detailed information including protein ID, the site location, the fragment sequence, etc. is listed in Table S1 (ESI†).

From cou.: 9 Each site was represented by a 13-residue long peptide centered at the proline or lysine of interest as described above. If the upstream or the downstream residue number was less than 6, symbol ‘X’ was assigned to represent the missing amino acid in the sequence fragment. Afterwards, each fragment was transformed into four categories of features.

From cou.: 11 Both the single amino acid composition and the K-spaced amino acid pair composition were calculated here. Single amino acid composition is the fraction of each amino acid type in a sequence fragment. The K-spaced amino acid pair composition was first proposed by Chen et al.15,18 for the prediction of protein flexible/rigid regions, and proved to be useful for the prediction of O-glycosylation sites19 and palmitoylation sites.20 The K-spaced amino acid pair compositions were calculated by considering the fraction of amino acid pairs that are separated by k amino acids within a protein sequence fragment (there are 441 possible pairs, e.g., AA, AC, AD,…,XX). We refer to such a feature vector as (CAkACAkCCAkD…CAkX)441. For instance, CA3C = NA3C/(N − 1), where NA3C is the number of occurrences of the AC amino acid pair separated by 3 amino acids and N is the residue length of the peptide. In this work, N set to 13 and k = 0, 1,…,9, 10 were jointly considered. In total, 4872 (21 + 441 × 11) compositional features were generated in this category.

From Soup: 34 For a given dataset of fixed-length sequence fragments, each amino acid at each position is associated with its frequency of occurrence. Using this frequency in both hydroxylation and non-hydroxylation sets of fragments in the training set, two position-weighted matrices (PWMs) 34,35 are calculated for both hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine data. Each row of the matrix corresponds to one type of amino acid, and every column corresponds to a position in the peptide. The element in the i -th row and j -th column of the matrix is defined as: where N ij is the number of occurrences of i -th amino acid in the j -th position of the peptide and N pep is the number of peptides in the whole dataset, i = 1, 2, 3…12, j = 1, 2, 3,…,13. Because two PWMs were built, 26 (13 × 2) features were extracted in this group.

From Soup: 36 Each amino acid of a peptide is encoded into a 21-bit vector by a one and twenty zeros. This vector represents the localization of 20 normal amino acids and a non-existent residue (represented by X) as “ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWXY”. A (Alanine) is encoded as “100000000000000000000”, the one in the vector alphabetically shifts to the right localization based on the letter abbreviation of the amino acids.

From Soup: 41 Aiming to further reduce the dimension of feature space and to find a restricted number of features yielding good classification performance, feature ranking and modeling by the RF method was performed here. The RF method was first introduced by Leo Breiman 16 and then proved to be a very powerful classification method in the fields of chemometrics and bioinformatics. 37–40 RF is a classifier consisting of a collection of tree-structured classifiers with two major advantages being (1) using an out-of-bag method 41 to monitor error, strength and correlation, and (2) measuring variable importance through permutation.

From cou.: 42 The SMOTE method was performed by the DMwR package in the R program.36
From Soup: 42 With a whole set of features to build an initial RF classification model, the results of the RF model are able to show the importance for each feature by its association with the prediction target. In this process, all features will first be trained to fit in a random forest. During the fitting process, the out-of-bag error for each data point is recorded and averaged over the forest. To measure the importance of the i -th feature after training, the values of the i -th feature are permuted among the training data and the out-of-bag error is again computed on this perturbed data set. The importance score for the i -th feature is computed by averaging the difference in out-of-bag error before and after the permutation over all trees. The score is normalized by the standard deviation of these differences. Features which produce large values for this score are ranked as more important than features which produce small values. Then, the importance ranking list of features was generated in this work. After that, with an increased number of top ranking features, different RF models will be built to select the best model that had the least feature space and had an equivalent prediction performance that are compared using the whole feature space.

From Soup: 43 There are two important parameters in the RF method that need to be tuned to get a better performance. The first one is ‘ntree’, which is the number of trees to grow. It should not be set to too small a number, to ensure that every input row gets predicted at least a few times. The second one is ‘mtry0’, which is the number of variables to split on at each node. The other parameters of the RF model were all set to default values.

From cou.: 45 There are two important parameters in the RF method that need to be tuned to get a better performance. The first one is ‘ntree’, which is the number of trees to grow. It should not be set to too small a number, to ensure that every input row gets predicted at least a few times. The second one is ‘mtry0’, which is the number of variables to split on at each node. The other parameters of the RF model were all set to default values.
From Soup: 45 Model evaluation was performed by not only jack-knife cross-validation on the training dataset, but also on an external validation set in order to prove the generalization ability of HydPred. For jack-knife cross-validation, each sample of the internal cross-validation set was treated as a test set once, while the remaining data, including N − 1 samples, were gathered as training data, where N is the total sample number of the internal cross-validation set. After N turns of calculation, the averaged prediction result of test sets was taken as the final jack-knife cross-validation result. For the external validations set, it was only used to test the generalization ability of the built model and not involved in any procedure of the modeling building process.

From cou.: 46 The feature ranking and modeling processes were solely based on the training dataset without any involvement of the external validation set. This performed a reliable supervised feature selection and modeling to avoid the over-fitting problem as Smialowski et al. emphasized.42 The RF method was implemented using the R package randomForest v 4.6-7.
From Soup: 46 Five frequently used indicators were utilized here, sensitivity (Sens), specificity (Spec), accuracy (ACC), MCC and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical plot that illustrates the performance of a binary classifier system while its decision threshold is varied. Each point in the ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate vs. the false positive rate at a particular decision threshold. The AUC, the area under the ROC curve, can give a complete evaluation of a prediction method. Some other parameters of the RF model, such as the number of trees and the number of leaves on each tree, were also optimized to maximize the AUC.

From Soup: 47 Because protein hydroxylation is associated with several serious diseases, 2,3,5,6,8–10,43,44 HydPred was then applied to analyze human inherited disease associated proteins to assess the loss and gain of hydroxylation sites that could underlie disease pathologies.

From Soup: 60 At first, the whole feature space was used to build the initial RF models for hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, respectively. The value of ntree was tuned from 200–1000 with a step of 100 while the value of mtry0 was tuned from 2 to 50 with a step of 1 in each tuning step of ntree. Then, ntree = 500 and mtry0 = 20 were selected as the optimal parameters with the best AUC performance as 0.952 for hydroxyproline and provided the ranking of feature importance accordingly. Likewise, for hydroxylysine, the initial RF model was built with the best AUC value as 0.977 (ntree = 500, mtry0 = 10). Then, different models were built on the increased number of top ranked features for both hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine using the RF algorithm.

Therefore, the 49 top ranked features were selected for hydroxyproline and the 44 top features were selected for hydroxylysine to build the HydPred predictor.

From Soup: 62 The detailed prediction performance of HydPred for jack-knife cross-validation and external validation is listed in Tables 1 and 2 , where the results of the external validation set are fairly stable compared with cross validation results on the training set, which is a sign of favorable generalization ability for a classifier. 45

From Soup: 63 Because prior methods to predict protein hydroxylation sites used several different datasets, a more rigorous performance comparison between HydPred and previous predictors was performed. First, jack-knife cross-validation results reported for established methods were compared with those for HydPred ( Table 1 ). Then, the well-established methods for which the software was either available online or ready to be downloaded were tested on the same external validation set.

From Soup: 65 Compared with the best score of prior published predictors, our HydPred method showed a remarkable improvement in the MCC score in both jack-knife cross-validation ( Table 1 ) and external validation ( Table 2 ). For the first time, the MCC score achieved up to 0.770 for hydroxyproline and 0.857 for hydroxylysine based on jack-knife evaluation. However, a prediction method with only cross-validation results is still far from being a reliable predictor for the over-fitting problem that is occasionally found in such a situation. 46 Therefore, an external validation on a dataset that is not involved in the model building process is crucial for estimating the real performance and generalization ability of a predictor. In other words, only predictors with outstanding prediction performance on both cross-validation and external validation can be proved to be reliable predictors.

From Soup: 67 The SMOTE method also has favorable performance by solving the unbalanced problem of positive and negative samples. As observed from Table 1 , the unbalanced problem did not usually affect the cross-validation results, as nearly all of the methods had a comparative sensitivity and specificity whether they accounted for the unbalanced problem. However, once they were tested by an external validation set, the unbalanced problem occurred ( Table 2 ). This was particularly evident for the prediction of hydroxyproline. Although the PredHydroxy (70%) method showed comparative MCC results with our HydPred method, it only showed a sensitivity of 0.491, which means that more than half of the positive samples were mis-predicted to be negative samples. Although it also showed good ACC results, this lack of sensitivity of the PredHyrdroxy method is not acceptable. Consequently, HydPred is currently the most promising predictor of hydroxylation sites due to its ability to solve the problem of unbalanced data.

From Soup: 69 Among these features, the majority of them were classified into category I as component features (30/49 for hydroxyproline and 24/44 for hydroxylysine) which suggests that the residue component is one of the keys that helps prolyl-hydroxylases/lysyl-hydroxylases to recognize their substrate. Here, glysine (G) plays a rather important role since it is involved in more than half of these component features (16/30 for hydroxyproline and 17/24 in hydroxylysine).

From Soup: 70 The binary localization encoding strategy as category IV implies the same deduction with more details. It suggests that the binary localization encoding of G at positions 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 11 are all important for hydroxyproline. It is slightly different for hydroxylysine since the important binary localization of G is only at positions 2, 5, 8 and 11.

Here, glysine (G) plays a rather important role since it is involved in more than half of these component features (16/30 for hydroxyproline and 17/24 in hydroxylysine).
From Soup: 71 The above analyses were further complemented by the key features from PWMs as category III. For hydroxyproline, it emphasizes that positive PWMs were at positions 2, 5, 8 and 11 and the negative PWMs were at positions 3, 6, 8, 9, 11 and 12. For hydroxylysine, it selected the key features of positive PWMs at positions 2, 3, 6, 8, 9 and 11 and negative PWMs at positions 2, 3, 5, 8 and 11.

From cou.: 72 The binary localization encoding strategy as category IV implies the same deduction with more details.

It is slightly different for hydroxylysine since the important binary localization of G is only at positions 2, 5, 8 and 11.
From Soup: 72 In order to illustrate these results intuitively, the Two Sample Logo (TSL) 47 tool was utilized here ( Fig. 3 ). The TSL method can calculate and visualize the differences between the positive and negative sets of aligned peptides by the T -test and then present the enriched and depleted residue types in each position. The enrichment of residues can partially but not entirely reflect the positive PWM features and the depleted residues can partially reflect the negative ones. In Fig. 3 , it is obvious that G is enriched at positions 2, 5, 8 and 11 in both hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine samples, meanwhile it is also depleted at positions 3, 6, 8 and 12 for both of them as well. Besides, P is also enriched in multiple positions of hydroxylation samples. Here, it is also slightly different for hydroxyproline from hydroxylysine. The enriched positions for P in hydroxyproline are 3, 6, 9 and 12, but in hydroxylysine, the positions are 1, 3, 4, 6, 10 and 13. From Table 3 , residue P is also involved in many key component features in HydPred, as 6 for hydroxyproline and 7 for hydroxylysine. Residue P has a distinctive five-member cyclic group compared with other residues which can only be a H-bond acceptor but not a donor. It is interesting that residues G and P are the only two residues that do not follow along with the typical Ramachandran plot 48 and they are all enriched in hydroxylation samples. The combination of G and P in a peptide would deduce two completely different consequences in their 2D structures, which is either rather ordered because of the distinct structure of residue P, such as in collagen (basically as a repeated GPP format), or tends to be a disordered coil since residue P is rarely found in α-helix or β-sheet structures expect in fibre proteins like collagen. It implies that the binding site of prolyl-hydroxylases/lysyl-hydroxylases is either in a rather ordered structure like in the helix in collagen or tend to be in a disordered coil. Residue C is also enriched in most positions of hydroxyproline samples, such as positions 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Coordinating with this phenomenon, the single amino acid component of C is also selected as key feature in HydPred for hydroxyproline.

From Soup: 73 Besides, residue H, as the only residue with both a five-member cyclic group and positive charge, is involved in 8 key component features for Hydroxyproline, but it does not show up for hydroxylysine at all. Interestingly, the same as a residue with positive charge, K shows up 7 times in key features for hydroxylysine but not once in hydroxyproline. It may imply that the side chain with a positive charge group is important for hydroxylation, where H contributes especially to the binding of prolyl-hydroxylases while K contributes especially to that of lysyl-hydroxylases. Since H does not show up as the enrichment residues in hydroxyproline samples ( Fig. 3A ), it suggests H does not tent to locate at specialized positions of a hydroxyproline sample. Meanwhile, K tends to locate at 4 and 10 in a hydroxylysine sample ( Fig. 3B ).

From Soup: 74 For category II, the volume involved features were selected as key features for both hydroxyproline (as GearynAuto_11_2) and hydroxylysine (as GearyAuto_6_2). Referring back to the component features, most of the residues that are involved in the key component features are residues with small volumes, such as G, A, S, P, T, D, E. The residue with big volume, such as M, W and Y, does not appear in any of these key features. This phenomenon suggests that the hydroxylysine sites are likely to exist in the neighbourhood of residues with small volumes.

From Soup: 75 Human disease associated variation data was gathered from the SwissVar 49 database (release 201504). There are 26 087 disease related variations and 38 058 neutral polymorphisms in 12 569 proteins in all. From these, fragments of 13 residues centered on prolines and lysines where the variations are inside of these fragments were extracted as the disease-related or polymorphism related samples. HydPred was then employed to predict the loss or gain of hydroxylation sites for both polymorphisms and disease related samples that were caused by the variations. One thing should be noted that the distribution of training data for HydPred is unlikely identical to the human variation data. Therefore, we addressed a ‘high confidence’ loss or gain of hydroxylation sites, inspired by Radivojac's work 50 to overcome the possibility of biased inference on the false positive rate. Therefore, only the site with a value of P l ( s i ) or P g ( s i ) that is larger than 0.500 for hydroxyproline and 0.400 for hydroxylysine (both higher than the cutoff value of HydPred) was assigned as a high confidence loss or gain of the hydroxylation site. Correspondingly, only these sites were then analyzed in the further procedure.

From Soup: 76 The statistic results in Table 3 indicate that the loss of both hydroxyproline sites and hydroxylysine sites is significantly higher in disease associated variations than in polymorphisms according to the small p -values (as 1.29 × 10 −8 and 9.67× 10 −4 ) that was calculated by the chi-square test ( L · p -value in Table 3 ), which suggests that the loss of hydroxylation sites is likely to be involved with the pathogenesis of human inherited diseases. Meanwhile, the p -values for the gain of hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine sites are both higher than 0.05, which suggests that the gain of hydroxylation sites is not significant for disease-associated variations against polymorphisms and consequently implies that the gain of hydroxylation sites is not likely to be strongly associated with disease.

Correspondingly, only these sites were then analyzed in the further procedure.
From Soup: 77 The predicted high confidence loss of hydroxylation sites in disease associated variations is listed in Table S3 (ESI † ) for further analyses. Among these disease-associated variations, 111 of them are predicted to cause 117 different high-confidence loss of hydroxylation sites by the HydPred method (Table S3, ESI † ). It indicated that about 0.43% (111/26 087) disease-associated variations will cause high-confidence loss of hydroxylation sites. In other words, it also implies that among these disease-associated variations, about 0.43% of the disease-causing mechanisms may be related to the loss of hydroxylation sites.

Among these, 68 variations within 11 proteins are involved in 18 types of disease that are implicated with dysplasia of the skeleton, joint, muscle or skin, which are mostly due to variations in the hydroxylation of collagen (noted by ‘a’ in Table S3, ESI † ). Indeed, most of the loss of hydroxylysine sites are involved in this category of diseases.

From Soup: 80 Previous studies have reported the association of the disruption of hydroxylation sites with diseases caused by the defect of collagen, 5,43 malfunction of the neurological system 7 and kidney disease. 3 All these diseases are included in the results of the above analyses. However, the other associations with abnormalities of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function or blood and severe immunodeficiency are rarely reported. Although variations in the primary protein sequence and function may underlie the pathologies of these diseases, in some examples, such as Brugada syndrome-1, 51 this is unclear. Our analyses indicate that there is also a strong likelihood that the loss of hydroxylation sites may play a key role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Indeed, our predicted hypo-hydroxylation of protein variants associated with these diseases may well be provided as a basis for the development of novel therapies in the future.

From cou.: 82 Previous studies have reported the association of the disruption of hydroxylation sites with diseases caused by the defect of collagen,5,43 malfunction of the neurological system7 and kidney disease.3 All these diseases are included in the results of the above analyses. However, the other associations with abnormalities of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function or blood and severe immunodeficiency are rarely reported. Although variations in the primary protein sequence and function may underlie the pathologies of these diseases, in some examples, such as Brugada syndrome-1,51 this is unclear. Our analyses indicate that there is also a strong likelihood that the loss of hydroxylation sites may play a key role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Indeed, our predicted hypo-hydroxylation of protein variants associated with these diseases may well be provided as a basis for the development of novel therapies in the future.
From Soup: 82 The interface of HydPred is shown in Fig. 4A . Users can input single or multiple protein sequences in a FASTA format into the textbox and press the ‘submit’ button. Then, all of the prolines and lysines in a protein will be predicted to be hydroxylation sites or not. After the calculation, the outputs will be listed in the results page, as shown in Fig. 4B . It takes approximately 2 seconds to calculate and output the prediction results for both hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine for a protein of approximately 200 residues. Correspondingly, the time cost is multiplied when more protein sequences are inputted.

From Soup: 83 In this work, we describe a reliable identification method for protein hydroxylation sites called HydPred and comprehensively studied the potential loss or gain of hydroxylation sites in human inherited disease for the first time. The introduction of the SMOTE algorithm in HydPred fixed the unbalanced problem of positive and negative samples; hence, it showed a more favorable performance, especially on the external validation set compared to other published predictors in the same field. The web server of HydPred is a fast and reliable annotation tool for hydroxylation sites in newly discovered protein sequences. Moreover, the application of HydPred suggests that the loss of hydroxylation sites is more likely to be involved in human inherited disease than the gain of hydroxylation sites. 52 different types of diseases were found to be associated with potential loss of hydroxylation sites in the corresponding protein variants, which presents a new angle for understanding the basis of disease pathogenesis and developing targeted therapies at the molecular level.
