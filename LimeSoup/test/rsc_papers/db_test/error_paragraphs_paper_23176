From cou.: 1 In this work we use a computational cell-based model to study the influence of the mechanical properties of cells on the mechanics of epithelial tissues. We analyze the effect of the model parameters on the elasticity and the mechanical response of tissues subjected to stress loading application. We compare our numerical results with experimental measurements of epithelial cell monolayer mechanics. Unlike previous studies, we have been able to estimate in physical units the parameter values that match the experimental results. A key observation is that the model parameters must vary with the tissue strain. In particular, it was found that, while the perimeter contractility and the area elasticity of cells remain constant at lower strains (<20%), they must increase to respond to larger strains (>20%). However, above a threshold of 50% extension, the cells stop counteracting the tissue strain and reduce both their perimeter contractility and area elasticity.

From cou.: 2 Epithelium is one of the four basic types of animal tissues, along with the connective, muscle and nervous tissues. They line cavities, glands and surfaces throughout the body. The skin and the intestinal system are major examples thereof. An important work is done to understand the effect of cell biophysics on the emergence of higher scale properties, such as tissue's mechanics, shape and size. An increasing number of experiments are performed to characterize the mechanics of single cells and cell monolayers,1–4 and to understand the way the mechanical behavior of tissues results from cellular and subcellular properties.5,6

From cou.: 3 In addition to experimental research, computational models of epithelium are used to investigate the contribution of cell mechanics in many biological processes, such as cell sorting,7–10 wound healing,11–13 embryo development,14 and organ morphogenesis.15,16 Various cell-based modeling approaches are commonly used for these purposes, including Cellular Potts Models, Boundary Cell Models and Vertex Models. They generally depend on three independent energy terms, related to internal cell pressure, actomyosin cortex contractility and intercellular adhesion.17 They differ in their cell representation and dynamics. The Cellular Potts Model18 is lattice-based, which allows the representation of arbitrary cell shapes, but may be computationally expensive, especially when cells exert forces with non-local effects, such as apical constriction. The Boundary Cell Model14 represents cells by finely resolved polygons, where each cell has its own edges. Although it allows neighbor cells to adhere and detach from each other, it needs a permanent detection and management of undesired overlapping of neighbor cells, which increases its computational cost. The Vertex Model,19 which is the approach we use in this paper, represents cells by polygons sharing common edges with neighbor cells, and allows us to effectively model densely packed epithelium tissues with low complexity and reasonable implementation effort.

From cou.: 5 In this work, we modify the model proposed by Farhadifar et al.20 to study the mechanical properties of simulated cell monolayers. By comparing our numerical results with experimental measurements obtained from cultured cell monolayers,1,5 we determine how the mechanical properties of cells evolve with increasing tissue strain. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our cell-based model of epithelial cell monolayers. Results and discussion are presented in Section 3. In Section 3.1, we compute the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for a wide range of dimensionless cell contractility and intercellular adhesion parameters. In Section 3.2, we compare numerical simulations with experimental results. In Section 3.3, we explain the algorithm used to calibrate the model parameters from experimental data. In Section 3.4, we show that the experimental results can be better reproduced by adapting the value of Γ and K as the tissue strain increases. Finally, we conclude in Section 4 by summarizing the results and presenting the future work.

From Soup: 62 To determine the position of vertices that minimizes H , Farhadifar et al. 20 used the Conjugate Gradient Method and studied the equilibrium state of the tissue only. In addition, the model proposes a simple way to simulate the growth and division of cells to implement cell proliferation. Because this paper focuses on studying the elasticity of simulated cell monolayers at short timescales, where no cell division or topology rearrangement takes place, in agreement with the experiments performed by Harris et al. , 5 we will not consider cell division in our simulations and therefore this part of the model is not described any further.

From Soup: 92 A second difference with respect to the approach of Farhadifar et al. 20 involves the boundary conditions. Instead of a periodic tissue, we choose to implement open boundary conditions, as illustrated in Fig. 3 . The tissue has borders that separate it from its environment (black line). A cell which is located at the border of the tissue is referred to as a boundary cell (red cells) and has at least one boundary edge (black edges). In contrast to a bulk edge (green edges), which is always shared by two neighbor cells, a boundary edge belongs to one cell only. It represents the interface between the cell and the tissue's environment. The two vertices linked by a boundary edge are referred to as boundary vertices (black points). It is through these boundary vertices that external mechanical constraints are easily applied on the simulated tissue. In addition to the external force, a boundary vertex is also subject to internal constraints generated by the tissue itself (see eqn (2) ).

These parameters represent the normalized perimeter contractility of cells and the normalized line tension along cell/cell junctions, respectively.

From Soup: 102 E and ν are obtained by stretching a simulated tissue along the X -axis with a given constant stress σ (see Fig. 4 ). Each stretching simulation starts with the creation of a square tissue made up of 41 × 41 regular hexagonal cells with an initial cell area equal to their preferred area A 0 . First, the created tissue, which is free from external constraint, undergoes an initial relaxation toward its steady state minimizing its energy. The area of cells at this stage is denoted by A steady . When Γ and Λ are null, A steady is equal to A 0 . The length and the width of the tissue at this stage are denoted by X steady and Y steady . Then, the tissue is stretched with a given constant stress σ . When the deformation of the loaded tissue stabilizes, the resulting elongation δ X of the tissue along the stretching axis and its shrinkage δ Y along the opposite direction are measured (see Fig. 5 ).

The external force is distributed along the width of the tissue Y ( t ) and its thickness Z ( t ). Because we use a 2D-model, the thickness of the cells is considered approximately constant Z ( t ) = Z and estimated by the diameter of the cell at its steady unconstrained state. The estimation of the applied stress using an approximate constant cell monolayer thickness was used to compute the experimental results 5 that are compared to our simulations throughout this article. The Young's modulus E is the ratio of the linear stress σ to the linear strain (see eqn (7) ). It represents the stiffness of the cell monolayer. The Poisson's ratio ν is the ratio of the lateral strain to the axial strain . It measures the thinning of the cell monolayer in the lateral direction with respect to its axial extension.

From cou.: 115 X
From Soup: 115 The stretching simulations are performed on tissues where all cells are given the same preferred area A 0 = 90 × 10 −12 m 2 , area elasticity coefficient K = 10 9 N m −3 , and perimeter contractility Γ . In ref. 3 , the area compressibility modulus K A = K · A 0 is found to be on the order of 10 −1 N m −1 . Therefore, we estimate our model parameter K corresponding to the area elasticity of the cell on the order of 10 9 N m −3 . All the bulk edges have a line tension Λ . The boundary edges are assigned with a line tension . This is a way to keep a similar global tension along all edges. Because a boundary edge belongs to one cell only, it is subjected to one cell cortical tension, compared to the bulk edges, which are shared by two cells, and are therefore subject to a double cortical tension. Subjecting the boundary edges to a higher tension than bulk edges is possible by assigning them a higher line tension Λ than bulk edges. This does not change the qualitative impact of the model parameters on the elastic properties of the simulated tissues. The results stated in what follows remain true. Quantitatively, it is observed that increasing the line tension along boundary edges, while keeping cell contractility and line tension along bulk edges constant, increases the tissue stiffness. However, the importance of the tissue stiffness increase becomes negligible as the tissue size is bigger.

From Soup: 118 In both Fig. 6a and b , four regions are visible. No simulations were possible in Regions 1 and 4 due to a non-physical behavior ( e.g. the cell size minimizing the energy is 0). 25

From cou.: 119 Y
From Soup: 119 In Region 2, the increase of the perimeter contractility or the line tension induces an increase in the Young's modulus. When and increase, the tissue gets stiffer. On the right of Region 2, we find a thin region, referred to as Region 3. There, increasing perimeter contractility of cells or the line tension along edges decreases the Young's modulus.
 ###### 
From cou.: 120 Y
From Soup: 120 Fig. 6b shows a large region, called Region 2′, where increasing or decreases the Poisson's ratio. In this case less thinning is measured laterally with respect to the linear strain. A thin region of parameter, Region 3′, appears between Region 2′ and Region 4. There, we observe negative values of Poisson's ratio. They are due to an extension along both stretching and lateral directions, instead of extending along the stretching direction and shrinking along the lateral direction, as it is the case in Region 2′. This corresponds to cases where the cell contractility would be so important (and unbalanced by cell/cell adhesion) that stretching the tissue along one direction ( X ) leads to its extension along the transversal direction ( Y ) to minimize the energy equation and maintain the cell shape as round as possible.
 ###### 
From cou.: 121 The stretching simulations are performed on tissues where all cells are given the same preferred area A0 = 90 × 10−12 m2, area elasticity coefficient K = 109 N m−3, and perimeter contractility Γ. In ref. 3, the area compressibility modulus KA = K·A0 is found to be on the order of 10−1 N m−1. Therefore, we estimate our model parameter K corresponding to the area elasticity of the cell on the order of 109 N m−3. All the bulk edges have a line tension Λ. The boundary edges are assigned with a line tension . This is a way to keep a similar global tension along all edges. Because a boundary edge belongs to one cell only, it is subjected to one cell cortical tension, compared to the bulk edges, which are shared by two cells, and are therefore subject to a double cortical tension. Subjecting the boundary edges to a higher tension than bulk edges is possible by assigning them a higher line tension Λ than bulk edges. This does not change the qualitative impact of the model parameters on the elastic properties of the simulated tissues. The results stated in what follows remain true. Quantitatively, it is observed that increasing the line tension along boundary edges, while keeping cell contractility and line tension along bulk edges constant, increases the tissue stiffness. However, the importance of the tissue stiffness increase becomes negligible as the tissue size is bigger.
From Soup: 121 Laboratory experiments were conducted by Harris et al. 5 on cultured cell monolayers. Actin cytoskeleton was depolymerized and myosin II activity was inhibited using Latranculin B and Y27632, respectively. It was observed that these two actions decreased the stiffness of the tissue. This is consistent with the result of Fig. 6a , in which decreasing cell perimeter contractility reduces the Young's modulus of the simulated cell monolayer.
 ###### 
From cou.: 122 The value of the applied stress is σ = 700 Pa. It corresponds to a dimensionless stress . This value is considered by Harris et al.5 as a low stress intensity and yields an extension of 6% with the parameter values ( = 0.12 and = 0.04) proposed by Farhadifar et al.20
From Soup: 122 To study the effect of intercellular adhesion on the cultured monolayer mechanics, Harris et al. 5 disrupted the cell/cell adhesion using a treatment with EDTA, a divalent cation chelator that blocks cadherin-mediated adhesion. They observed that it reduced the stiffness of the tissue. This is not consistent with the numerical result of Fig. 6a , in which decreasing the intercellular adhesion (increasing ) increases the Young's modulus. One explanation of this inconsistency is that the treatment with EDTA did not only disrupt the intercellular adhesion, but it also altered the actin cytoskeleton. 26 We should therefore compare this experiment with a simultaneous increase of and decrease of . As shown in Fig. 6a , the variation rate of and can make the numerical simulation compatible with the experiment. To confirm this hypothesis, additional experiments acting solely on the intercellular adhesion should be performed.

From cou.: 123 Our results on the influence of the model parameters on the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are displayed in Fig. 6a and b, respectively. In these figures, each blue dot is a pair (,) of normalized parameter values characterizing a cell monolayer whose elastic properties were measured. The contour lines, obtained by interpolating the values computed at each blue dots, are also shown.
From Soup: 123 Our results seem to contradict those obtained using a very similar model by Xu et al. 27 They found that reducing the contractility of actin-myosin rings and enhancing the cell adhesion increase the stiffness of the monolayers. One explanation of this discrepancy is that they used different boundary conditions. In addition to stretching the simulated tissues to study their mechanical response, the upper and lower boundaries (in the transverse direction to stretching) were constrained such that the tissue does not deform in this direction. This additional constraint biases the results obtained when analyzing the effect of the cellular mechanical properties on the tissue mechanical response. In particular this is not consistent with the experiments of Harris et al. , 5 where indeed little or no tissue deformation was observed along the transversal direction of stretching, but where no experimental constraint was applied on the tissue to force it. Our results show that the tissues generated using this model generally shrink along the Y direction when they are stretched along the X direction, in contrast to what was observed experimentally. This needs to be highlighted, so that the differences between the experimental observations and the simulations generated using this model are clear, and so that it questions the validity of the 2D numerical model in this context. A second point is that Xu et al. studied the system for a range of parameters, which according to our findings (see below) does not correspond to the experimental behavior.

From cou.: 125 In Region 2, the increase of the perimeter contractility or the line tension induces an increase in the Young's modulus. When and increase, the tissue gets stiffer. On the right of Region 2, we find a thin region, referred to as Region 3. There, increasing perimeter contractility of cells or the line tension along edges decreases the Young's modulus.
From Soup: 125 Fig. 7 represents the time-dependent deformation of an experimentally cultured cell monolayer subjected to stress loadings of 700 Pa and 3000 Pa (see grey and black curves). These experimental results are compared to the time-dependent deformation of a simulated cell monolayer subjected to the same stress loading intensities (see green and red curves). At low-stress loading (700 Pa), it was shown that the strain of cultured cell monolayers increases rapidly in response to stress application before reaching a plateau that subsists over 200 s (see the grey curve of Fig. 7 ). In contrast, when a high stress (3000 Pa) is applied, no plateau is reached and strain increases continually with time (see the black curve of Fig. 7 ).

The area elasticity coefficient and the preferred area are set to K = 2.67 × 10 9 N m −3 and A 0 = 70 × 10 −12 m 2 . These parameters are estimated using the iterative algorithm presented in Section 3.3, such that a stress loading of 700 Pa yields an extension of 14% (see the green curve) and thus be consistent with the experimental data (see the grey curve).

From Soup: 127 The figure shows that in the simulations the strain reaches a plateau for both low and high stress-loading (green and red curves), at about the same timescale O (10 s). This result indicates that the model is consistent with experiments for low-stress loading but that it is not behaving realistically under high stress application. The inability of the model to reproduce the creep-response of tissues subjected to high-stress loading is discussed later in the conclusion.

To confirm this hypothesis, additional experiments acting solely on the intercellular adhesion should be performed.
From Soup: 128 Moreover, it was found (see the red dotted curve in Fig. 8 ) that the stress-extension curve of cultured cell monolayers displays three different regimes: 5 (i) a first region of low stiffness (≈5 kPa) for an extension between 0 and ≈20%; (ii) a second region between approximately 25% and 50% of extension, where the slope of the stress–strain curve is about 20 kPa, almost four times bigger than in the first region, and (iii) a mechanical failure for extensions >70%, following a plateau of the curve.

A second point is that Xu et al. studied the system for a range of parameters, which according to our findings (see below) does not correspond to the experimental behavior.
From Soup: 129 In addition to these experimental data, Fig. 8 also displays the stress-extension curves for four numerically simulated cell monolayers. They have been produced with the four pairs of normalized parameters ( = 0.005, = 0.04), ( = 0.03, = −0.14), ( = 0.19, = −1.30) and ( = 0.35, = −2.47). For all four of them, the parameters K and A 0 were set to 2.3 × 10 9 N m −3 and 70 × 10 −12 m 2 , respectively. The figure shows that the relation between the stress loading and the extension of the simulated monolayer is non-linear and depends on the normalized parameters ( , ). While the four pairs of normalized parameters were chosen to match the experimental stress–strain curve for less than 20% extension, we observe that the four curves are different at higher strains. We notice that for strains larger than 0.2, the slope of the curve increases as and − get larger.
 ###### 
From cou.: 130 In this section, we analyze the mechanical behavior of numerically simulated cell monolayers subjected to different stress loading intensities. We compare these numerical results to the mechanical properties of cultured cell monolayers that were experimentally measured.5
From Soup: 130 This numerical observation is consistent with the results presented in the study of Harris et al. , 4,5 where the stiffness of a monolayer was computed from the slope of the stress–strain curve between approximately 25% and 50% extension, and where it was observed that the depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton, the inhibition of the myosin contractility as well as the disruption of the intercellular adhesion lead to a decrease in the stiffness of the tissue.
 ###### 
From cou.: 131 Fig. 7 represents the time-dependent deformation of an experimentally cultured cell monolayer subjected to stress loadings of 700 Pa and 3000 Pa (see grey and black curves). These experimental results are compared to the time-dependent deformation of a simulated cell monolayer subjected to the same stress loading intensities (see green and red curves). At low-stress loading (700 Pa), it was shown that the strain of cultured cell monolayers increases rapidly in response to stress application before reaching a plateau that subsists over 200 s (see the grey curve of Fig. 7). In contrast, when a high stress (3000 Pa) is applied, no plateau is reached and strain increases continually with time (see the black curve of Fig. 7).
From Soup: 131 In summary, we found that our model is able to match the experiments at low-stress loading. It also reproduces the experimental observations 4,5 that the stiffness of the tissue at higher strains (from 0.25 to 0.50 strain) increases with the increase of the cell contractility and the cell/cell adhesion. But, in its current state, the numerical model does not reproduce well the slope of the stress–strain curve for strains comprised between 25% and 50% extension. Therefore, in Section 3.4, we will assume that the values of the model parameters can change with the strain to better match the experimental stress–strain measurements of Harris et al. 5 Before that, we propose in Section 3.3 a systematic method to fit the parameters of the model from the experimental data.
 ###### 
From cou.: 132 The simulated cell monolayer shown in Fig. 7 is made up of cells with = 0.16 and = −1.10. The area elasticity coefficient and the preferred area are set to K = 2.67 × 109 N m−3 and A0 = 70 × 10−12 m2. These parameters are estimated using the iterative algorithm presented in Section 3.3, such that a stress loading of 700 Pa yields an extension of 14% (see the green curve) and thus be consistent with the experimental data (see the grey curve).
From Soup: 132 From the above results, we found that no constant model parameters ( K , A 0 , Λ , and Γ ) match the experimental stress–strain curve of cultured cell monolayers from lower strains (<20%) to higher strains (>20%) (see Fig. 8 ). Therefore we investigate the possibility that the model parameters change with stress loading and strain. For this reason we developed an iterative process giving the value of the parameters reproducing a given strain–stress pair, without the need for an exhaustive exploration of the parameter space.
 ###### 
From cou.: 133 The figure shows that in the simulations the strain reaches a plateau for both low and high stress-loading (green and red curves), at about the same timescale O(10 s). This result indicates that the model is consistent with experiments for low-stress loading but that it is not behaving realistically under high stress application. The inability of the model to reproduce the creep-response of tissues subjected to high-stress loading is discussed later in the conclusion.
From Soup: 133 We suppose here that the line tension Λ remains constant despite the tissue extension. It was estimated experimentally 5 that the average force required to separate two cells within the cultured cell monolayer is 1.7 × 10 −6 N. We deduce that it corresponds to a line tension along edges separating two neighbor cells Λ = −1.7 × 10 −6 N. Moreover, from the estimation of the cell diameter a ≈ 10 −5 m, we deduce that the steady area of an unconstrained cell A steady is the area of a regular hexagon with a circumradius r = 5 × 10 −6 m, and thus A steady = 65 × 10 −12 m 2 .
 ###### 
From cou.: 134 Moreover, it was found (see the red dotted curve in Fig. 8) that the stress-extension curve of cultured cell monolayers displays three different regimes:5 (i) a first region of low stiffness (≈5 kPa) for an extension between 0 and ≈20%; (ii) a second region between approximately 25% and 50% of extension, where the slope of the stress–strain curve is about 20 kPa, almost four times bigger than in the first region, and (iii) a mechanical failure for extensions >70%, following a plateau of the curve.
From Soup: 134 In addition, we also assume that the ratio does not change with strain. A 0 is estimated as the cell area when the actomyosin cortex is inhibited, and A steady when it is active. Indeed, it was observed 1 that disrupting the actomyosin cortex increases the cell volume by 7 ± 4% and abolishes the rounding-pressure. We consider that with a normal activity of the cytoskeleton, the area of a cell corresponds to A steady , while the inhibition of the actomyosin activity makes the cell area increase and reach the cell preferred area A 0 . We can use the quantitative measure of the cell volume increase resulting from actomyosin cortex disruption to estimate the ratio between the preferred area of a cell A 0 and its unconstrained steady area A steady . Hence, we may estimate that and A 0 = 70 × 10 −12 m 2 , if we approximate the volume V of the cell by V = A · h , where the height of the cell h remains approximately constant.
 ###### 
From cou.: 135 In addition to these experimental data, Fig. 8 also displays the stress-extension curves for four numerically simulated cell monolayers. They have been produced with the four pairs of normalized parameters ( = 0.005, = 0.04), ( = 0.03, = −0.14), ( = 0.19, = −1.30) and ( = 0.35, = −2.47). For all four of them, the parameters K and A0 were set to 2.3 × 109 N m−3 and 70 × 10−12 m2, respectively. The figure shows that the relation between the stress loading and the extension of the simulated monolayer is non-linear and depends on the normalized parameters (, ). While the four pairs of normalized parameters were chosen to match the experimental stress–strain curve for less than 20% extension, we observe that the four curves are different at higher strains. We notice that for strains larger than 0.2, the slope of the curve increases as and − get larger.
From Soup: 135 Our parameter estimator takes as input the experimentally determined value of Λ , A 0 , as well as and , the expected tissue strain when a given stress σ is applied.
 ###### 
From cou.: 136 This numerical observation is consistent with the results presented in the study of Harris et al.,4,5 where the stiffness of a monolayer was computed from the slope of the stress–strain curve between approximately 25% and 50% extension, and where it was observed that the depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton, the inhibition of the myosin contractility as well as the disruption of the intercellular adhesion lead to a decrease in the stiffness of the tissue.
From Soup: 136 Then we use the following iterative process. We start with i = 0 and a random value of the area elasticity K i , for instance K i = 1 N m −3 . Then, we compute the normalized line tension i as a function of our estimated values of Λ and A 0 , and the current value of K i ; . Given this value of i , we look for the corresponding normalized contractility i , such as the ratio between the preferred area of the cells and their steady area . For this purpose, we can refer to Fig. 9 , which represents the contour lines of the normalized steady area of cells as a function of the normalized parameters and .
 ###### 
From cou.: 137 In summary, we found that our model is able to match the experiments at low-stress loading. It also reproduces the experimental observations4,5 that the stiffness of the tissue at higher strains (from 0.25 to 0.50 strain) increases with the increase of the cell contractility and the cell/cell adhesion. But, in its current state, the numerical model does not reproduce well the slope of the stress–strain curve for strains comprised between 25% and 50% extension. Therefore, in Section 3.4, we will assume that the values of the model parameters can change with the strain to better match the experimental stress–strain measurements of Harris et al.5 Before that, we propose in Section 3.3 a systematic method to fit the parameters of the model from the experimental data.
From Soup: 137 We then determine the Young's modulus E i (see (7) ) corresponding to the pair of parameters ( i , i ) and an applied stress σ . While is different from the wanted value , we correct the value of K by computing K i +1 as
 ###### 
From cou.: 138 From the above results, we found that no constant model parameters (K, A0, Λ, and Γ) match the experimental stress–strain curve of cultured cell monolayers from lower strains (<20%) to higher strains (>20%) (see Fig. 8). Therefore we investigate the possibility that the model parameters change with stress loading and strain. For this reason we developed an iterative process giving the value of the parameters reproducing a given strain–stress pair, without the need for an exhaustive exploration of the parameter space.

From cou.: 139 We suppose here that the line tension Λ remains constant despite the tissue extension. It was estimated experimentally5 that the average force required to separate two cells within the cultured cell monolayer is 1.7 × 10−6 N. We deduce that it corresponds to a line tension along edges separating two neighbor cells Λ = −1.7 × 10−6 N. Moreover, from the estimation of the cell diameter a ≈ 10−5 m, we deduce that the steady area of an unconstrained cell Asteady is the area of a regular hexagon with a circumradius r = 5 × 10−6 m, and thus Asteady = 65 × 10−12 m2.
From Soup: 139 i
 ###### 
From cou.: 140 In addition, we also assume that the ratio does not change with strain. A0 is estimated as the cell area when the actomyosin cortex is inhibited, and Asteady when it is active. Indeed, it was observed1 that disrupting the actomyosin cortex increases the cell volume by 7 ± 4% and abolishes the rounding-pressure. We consider that with a normal activity of the cytoskeleton, the area of a cell corresponds to Asteady, while the inhibition of the actomyosin activity makes the cell area increase and reach the cell preferred area A0. We can use the quantitative measure of the cell volume increase resulting from actomyosin cortex disruption to estimate the ratio between the preferred area of a cell A0 and its unconstrained steady area Asteady. Hence, we may estimate that and A0 = 70 × 10−12 m2, if we approximate the volume V of the cell by V = A·h, where the height of the cell h remains approximately constant.
From Soup: 140 In summary, we loop on (a) computing the normalized line tension i with the new value of K i , (b) finding the corresponding normalized contractility i producing the right ratio between the preferred area of the cells and their steady area , and (c) correcting the value of K i until we obtain the experimental strain value corresponding to the applied stress loading σ .
 ###### 
From cou.: 141 Our parameter estimator takes as input the experimentally determined value of Λ, A0, as well as and , the expected tissue strain when a given stress σ is applied.
From Soup: 141 For a line tension Λ = −1.7 × 10 −6 N, a steady area A steady = 65 × 10 −12 m 2 , a ratio between the preferred area of cells and their steady area and a strain of 14% when a stress-loading of 700 Pa is applied (which is equivalent to a Young's modulus E = 5000 Pa), we estimate K to be equal to 2.67 × 10 9 N m −3 , = −1.10 and = 0.16.
 ###### 
From cou.: 142 Then we use the following iterative process. We start with i = 0 and a random value of the area elasticity Ki, for instance Ki = 1 N m−3. Then, we compute the normalized line tension i as a function of our estimated values of Λ and A0, and the current value of Ki; . Given this value of i, we look for the corresponding normalized contractility i, such as the ratio between the preferred area of the cells and their steady area . For this purpose, we can refer to Fig. 9, which represents the contour lines of the normalized steady area of cells as a function of the normalized parameters and .
From Soup: 142 In summary, for a Young's Modulus E = 5000 Pa corresponding to a 14% strain and a stress-loading of σ = 700 Pa, we have obtained
 ###### 
From cou.: 143 We then determine the Young's modulus Ei (see (7)) corresponding to the pair of parameters (i, i) and an applied stress σ. While is different from the wanted value , we correct the value of K by computing Ki+1 as
From Soup: 143 We can compare our results with experimental findings, 2 where the contractility stress is reported to be 3.4 × 10 3 N m −2 . However, this value corresponds to 3D cells. To roughly estimate the contractility tension for 2D cells, we can use the cell diameter a ≈ 10 −5 m, which is a natural length scale of the system. By dividing our result Γ = 3.01 × 10 −2 N m −1 by a , we obtain an equivalent cortical contractility stress of 3.01 × 10 3 N m −2 , which is compatible with ref. 2 .
 ###### 
From cou.: 144 i
From Soup: 144 Similarly, the area compressibility modulus K A = K · A 0 is found 3 to be on the order of 10 −1 N m −1 . To obtain an estimation of K , we divide K A by a 2 and we obtain K ≈ 10 9 N m −3 , in agreement with our value of K in eqn (10) .
 ###### 
From cou.: 145 i
From Soup: 145 In this section, we use the iterative process described above to find how the parameters of our model should evolve as a function of the tissue strain ε , in order to match the mechanical properties observed experimentally. It was observed that the tissue becomes stiffer and the slope of the stress–strain curve becomes ≈20 × 10 3 Pa, when the tissue is subjected to a high strain ( ε > 25%). 5 For a set of experimental strain–stress pairs taken over a large range of strains, from 5% to 75% (see Fig. 10 ), we estimate the corresponding model parameters.
 ###### 
From cou.: 146 In summary, we loop on (a) computing the normalized line tension i with the new value of Ki, (b) finding the corresponding normalized contractility i producing the right ratio between the preferred area of the cells and their steady area , and (c) correcting the value of Ki until we obtain the experimental strain value corresponding to the applied stress loading σ.
From Soup: 146 Experimental observations showed that, unlike the intermediate filaments, whose aspect changed during increasing monolayer extension, the intercellular adhesion of cells does not seem to be affected by cell monolayer extension. Thus, we consider that the parameter related to cell contractility may vary as a response to stretching, while we make the hypothesis that the line tension along cell/cell interfaces remains constant Λ = −1.7 × 10 −6 N, as well as the ratio between the preferred area of the cells and their unloaded steady area . In this case, for each pair of applied stress and resulting strain, two parameters of the model remain to be estimated, namely K and Γ .
 ###### 
From cou.: 147 For a line tension Λ = −1.7 × 10−6 N, a steady area Asteady = 65 × 10−12 m2, a ratio between the preferred area of cells and their steady area and a strain of 14% when a stress-loading of 700 Pa is applied (which is equivalent to a Young's modulus E = 5000 Pa), we estimate K to be equal to 2.67 × 109 N m−3, = −1.10 and = 0.16.
From Soup: 147 We find a first region ranging from 0% to 15% strain, where K and Γ are constant; K = 2.256 × 10 9 N m −3 and Γ = 2.98 × 10 −2 N m −1 . In a second region, from 15% to 50% strain, K and Γ increase with the strain. In the last region, when the strain is higher than 50%, K and Γ decrease with the increase of the strain (see Fig. 11a and b ). The evolution of the parameters K and Γ as a function of the strain can be fitted with polynomial functions of degree 3, represented by the red curves in Fig. 11a and b . With ε denoting the strain, we have
 ###### 
From cou.: 148 In summary, for a Young's Modulus E = 5000 Pa corresponding to a 14% strain and a stress-loading of σ = 700 Pa, we have obtained
From Soup: 148 We notice that K and Γ evolve identically over all the strain range. When Γ increases (or decreases), K increases (or decreases) as well. More precisely, increasing Γ increases the stiffness of the tissue and the ratio . In order to fulfill the hypothesis that remains constant during the stress loading process, K should increase to maintain the size of the cell.
 ###### 
From cou.: 149 We can compare our results with experimental findings,2 where the contractility stress is reported to be 3.4 × 103 N m−2. However, this value corresponds to 3D cells. To roughly estimate the contractility tension for 2D cells, we can use the cell diameter a ≈ 10−5 m, which is a natural length scale of the system. By dividing our result Γ = 3.01 × 10−2 N m−1 by a, we obtain an equivalent cortical contractility stress of 3.01 × 103 N m−2, which is compatible with ref. 2.
From Soup: 149 In other words, for a given cell/cell adhesion − Λ , the strain corresponding to a given stress depends only on the cell perimeter contractility Γ . The smaller the strain, the larger the cell perimeter contractility. The cell area elasticity modulus K is involved in maintaining the ratio between the preferred areas of cells and their unconstrained steady areas.
 ###### 
From cou.: 150 Similarly, the area compressibility modulus KA = K·A0 is found3 to be on the order of 10−1 N m−1. To obtain an estimation of K, we divide KA by a2 and we obtain K ≈ 109 N m−3, in agreement with our value of K in eqn (10).
From Soup: 150 With the proposed dependency of K and Γ on ε , the experimentally measured stress–strain curve of cultured cell monolayers can be successfully reproduced by our simulations (see Fig. 12 ).
 ###### 
From cou.: 151 In this section, we use the iterative process described above to find how the parameters of our model should evolve as a function of the tissue strain ε, in order to match the mechanical properties observed experimentally. It was observed that the tissue becomes stiffer and the slope of the stress–strain curve becomes ≈20 × 103 Pa, when the tissue is subjected to a high strain (ε > 25%).5 For a set of experimental strain–stress pairs taken over a large range of strains, from 5% to 75% (see Fig. 10), we estimate the corresponding model parameters.
From Soup: 151 In this work, we studied the mechanical properties of a vertex cell-based model for epithelium and compared the numerical simulations with experiments in which mechanical constraints are applied to a cell monolayer.
 ###### 
From cou.: 152 Experimental observations showed that, unlike the intermediate filaments, whose aspect changed during increasing monolayer extension, the intercellular adhesion of cells does not seem to be affected by cell monolayer extension. Thus, we consider that the parameter related to cell contractility may vary as a response to stretching, while we make the hypothesis that the line tension along cell/cell interfaces remains constant Λ = −1.7 × 10−6 N, as well as the ratio between the preferred area of the cells and their unloaded steady area . In this case, for each pair of applied stress and resulting strain, two parameters of the model remain to be estimated, namely K and Γ.
From Soup: 152 We analyzed the effect of cell contractility and intercellular adhesion on the elasticity of the tissue. Stretching simulations showed that the increase of cell contractility and the decrease of cell/cell adhesion lead to an increase of the stiffness of the tissue and a reduction of its Poisson's ratio.
 ###### 
From cou.: 153 We find a first region ranging from 0% to 15% strain, where K and Γ are constant; K = 2.256 × 109 N m−3 and Γ = 2.98 × 10−2 N m−1. In a second region, from 15% to 50% strain, K and Γ increase with the strain. In the last region, when the strain is higher than 50%, K and Γ decrease with the increase of the strain (see Fig. 11a and b). The evolution of the parameters K and Γ as a function of the strain can be fitted with polynomial functions of degree 3, represented by the red curves in Fig. 11a and b. With ε denoting the strain, we have
From Soup: 153 We also investigated the ability of the model to reproduce the stress–strain relation observed in vitro . Both real epithelium and simulated tissues exhibit a non-linear elastic behavior. The stiffness is more pronounced at larger strains especially when the cell perimeter contractility and the intercellular adhesion are high.
 ###### 
From cou.: 154 We notice that K and Γ evolve identically over all the strain range. When Γ increases (or decreases), K increases (or decreases) as well. More precisely, increasing Γ increases the stiffness of the tissue and the ratio . In order to fulfill the hypothesis that remains constant during the stress loading process, K should increase to maintain the size of the cell.
From Soup: 154 Experiments indicate that the slope of the stress–strain curve increases by a factor four when the strain gets larger than 25%. These low and high strain regimes can be reproduced numerically provided one introduces an adequate dependency of the cell perimeter contractility and area elasticity upon the strain. This dependency was determined by an iterative algorithm computing the model parameters that match a given stress–strain pair.
 ###### 
From cou.: 155 In other words, for a given cell/cell adhesion −Λ, the strain corresponding to a given stress depends only on the cell perimeter contractility Γ. The smaller the strain, the larger the cell perimeter contractility. The cell area elasticity modulus K is involved in maintaining the ratio between the preferred areas of cells and their unconstrained steady areas.
From Soup: 155 The numerical results suggest that the cells adapt their perimeter contractility and area elasticity to the strain. We found that while the cell area elasticity and perimeter contractility are constant under 15% extension, the first reaction of cells to address an increasing strain is to increase their perimeter contractility. In order to maintain a constant cell size, an increase of the area elasticity also occurs. But over a given threshold of 50% extension, cells stop counteracting the stretching and decrease their perimeter contractility and area elasticity, dissipating the energy excess induced by the stress loading, probably through cytoskeleton remodeling. This regime change at higher strains (over 50% extension) may pinpoint a permanent and irreversible change in the mechanical properties of cells. Indeed Harris et al. 5 described in their Supplementary Material that the stiffness of tissues decreases after being subjected to cyclic deformations.
 ###### 
From cou.: 156 With the proposed dependency of K and Γ on ε, the experimentally measured stress–strain curve of cultured cell monolayers can be successfully reproduced by our simulations (see Fig. 12).
From Soup: 156 However, even though the variation of the model parameters with the tissue strain allowed us to reproduce the experimental stress–strain curve, we could not reproduce the creep response at high stress (3000 Pa) application (see Section 3.2 and Fig. 7 ). It may be that the application of high stress-loading leading to a large extension of the tissue over a short period of time causes irreversible alteration of the cell cytoskeleton, reducing therefore the tissue stiffness and yielding larger extensions. The simulation of such phenomena should be the subject of future investigations.
 ###### 
From cou.: 157 In this work, we studied the mechanical properties of a vertex cell-based model for epithelium and compared the numerical simulations with experiments in which mechanical constraints are applied to a cell monolayer.
From Soup: 157 Finally, we made the hypothesis in this study that the intercellular adhesion is constant when the strain increases, and that the change of the perimeter contractility is balanced by a change of the area elasticity. But, other possibilities can be considered, for instance, keeping the area elasticity K constant and balancing the increase of the perimeter contractility Γ by an increase of the intercellular adhesion − Λ . The other scenarios will be investigated in a future work.

Stretching simulations showed that the increase of cell contractility and the decrease of cell/cell adhesion lead to an increase of the stiffness of the tissue and a reduction of its Poisson's ratio.
From Soup: 158 An important future task to consider as well is the development of a 3D model which would correct the weaknesses of the 2D model investigated in this paper. It would allow us to simulate the cell monolayer height thinning during stretching, and to reduce the shrinkage along the Y direction that was visible in the 2D model stretching simulations, but was negligible during experiments. Indeed, the extension of the tissue along the stretching axis X would be balanced to keep the cell volume constant by a thinning of the cell monolayer height instead of its shrinkage along the Y direction.

The first term of represents the cell area elasticity, where is the corresponding coefficient and is the preferred area of the cell . With being positive, this first term is minimized when the area of the cell tends to its preferred area . The second term of the energy represents the cell perimeter contractility, produced by the cell cytoskeleton, such as the actomyosin contractile ring running along the cell apical perimeter, and is the corresponding coefficient. With being positive, the minimization of this second term reduces the perimeter of the cell and makes the cell more round-shaped. Finally, the third term describes the line tensions along edges , which represent forces along cell/cell junctions resulting from adhesion molecules, mainly Cadherin, connecting neighbor cells. In contrast to the cell perimeter contractility , which is specific to a cell , the line tensions may vary from edge to edge. The value of can be positive or negative. With a negative value of , the edge is likely to be longer to minimize , which represents a junction between two cells that have a tendency to adhere to each other. On the other hand, when is positive, the edge is likely to be shorter to minimize , which represents a junction between two cells that tend to detach from each other (as used in ). In summary, reducing here the line tension along an edge separating two cells represents an increase of their adhesion and the expansion of their interface contact. While this last term is motivated by the idea that intercellular junction lengths depend on the potential energy of cell/cell adhesion, recent studies found that adhesion has little direct effect on contact expansion. However, it seems to control it indirectly by reducing the actomyosin contractility along the cell/cell contact. We emphasize that in this model, since two neighbor cells share a common edge, they cannot detach from each other and rupture the tissue even if the line tension is positive.
