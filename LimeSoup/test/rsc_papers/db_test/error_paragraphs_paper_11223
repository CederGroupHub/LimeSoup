From cou.: 1 Based on the results of density functional theory calculations, a theoretical method to design inorganic nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals for second harmonic generation (SHG) is presented. In this method, a specialized genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to search the stable structures of the inorganic crystal with known compositions and study the noncentrosymmetric stable structures and the second-order nonlinear optical properties by calculating the corresponding SHG coefficients. Unlike normal GA techniques, the main feature of the present method is that the coordination fashions of the building units are introduced to construct the structures of individuals during the GA procedure, which can obviously improve the efficiency and success rate of obtaining the stable structure of the inorganic crystals. As typical examples, two ternary compounds, AgGaS2 and LiAsSe2 crystals are considered, and besides the structures observed experimentally, the geometries and optical performance of other metastable (or more stable) phases have been explored. Our results clearly demonstrate that the present method can provide a feasible way to design and optimize new inorganic NLO crystals.

From cou.: 2 The investigation of new second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) materials has attracted considerable attention due to the important applications of these materials in optoelectronic technologies, such as in optical parametric oscillators (OPO), difference frequency generation (DFG), laser frequency conversion, and signal communication.1,2 Significant efforts have been made to develop new NLO crystals, and in the past few years many new inorganic NLO crystals have been synthesized, including some metal chalcogenides (e.g., APSe6 (A = K, Rb),3,4 AAsQ2 (A = Li, Na; Q = S, Se),5,6 AZrPQ67,8 and A4GeP4Q12 (A = K, Rb, Cs; Q = S, Se),9 Ln4GaSbS9 (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd–Ho),10 and Ln3GaS6 (Ln = Dy, Y)11), halides (e.g., Rb2CdBr2I2,12 Cs2HgI2Cl2,13 Hg2Br3I,14 and HgBrCl15), and borates (e.g., NaSr3Be3B3O9F4,16 Na2Be4B4O11 and LiNa5Be12B12O33,17 Ba4B11O20F,18 Cd5B3O9F,19 and K3B6O10Br20). A NLO crystal with excellent performance requires several conditions to be satisfied, including a high coefficient of second-order harmonic generation (SHG), a wide transparent region, good phase matchability, a moderate laser damage threshold, and the availability of the corresponding large-size crystal. However, many currently used NLO crystals have drawbacks in one or more respects, which causes difficulties in their applications. Therefore, the development of better NLO materials is still a subject posing a great challenge and one that is worth of deep study.

From cou.: 3 It is well known that only a noncentrosymmetric structure may possess second-order NLO effects; thus, major efforts have been made to construct noncentrosymmetric structures. On the basis of extensive experimental results, it is found that a common strategy to obtain noncentrosymmetric compounds is to incorporate asymmetric building blocks into the crystal structure.21 These include second-order Jahn–Teller distorted d0 early transition metal cations22 (e.g., V5+ in K3V5O14,23 Mo6+ in LaBMoO624 and Na2Te3Mo3O16,25 Ta5+ in Ag2Ta4O11,26 and W6+ in Na2TeW2O927), and anionic groups with stereochemically active lone pairs (e.g., (IO3)− in BiO(IO3)28 and AgI3O8,29 [AsS3]3− in LiAsS2,6 [SbS3]3− in Ba23Ga8Sb2S38,30 and [TeS3]2− in Ag2TeS331). However, we have to note that the introduction of the above asymmetric building units only enhances the possibility of yielding a conformation without an inversion center, and the final structure still relies on whether they are packed in a noncentrosymmetric fashion.21 Therefore, it is necessary to find effective ways to predict the mode of the packing pattern of these asymmetric building blocks as well as the associated NLO properties prior to the experiments.

From cou.: 4 In this paper, based on the results of the first principles calculations, we propose a new method to design inorganic NLO materials, in which the stable crystal structure of a compound with known composition is evaluated first by a specialized genetic algorithm (GA), combined by considering the structure of the building block, and then the corresponding optical properties are calculated theoretically by the length-gauge formalism. Using this method, the crystal structures and SHG effects of two ternary compounds, AgGaS2 and LiAsSe2, are determined and the results are compared with the experimental observations.

From cou.: 5 The flow chart of the method to design the NLO crystal is sketched in Fig. 1. In the first step, the composition and stoichiometry of the compound are provided. As mentioned above, one or more asymmetric blocks with known configurations are introduced to make the formation of noncentrosymmetric structure more likely, and additional cations or anions are further chosen to maintain charge neutrality of the whole system. In the second step, a float-encoding GA procedure is carried out to search the stable crystal structure of the designed compound (see next section), followed by the identification of the space group to check whether the crystal structure contains an inversion center. If so, there is a need to change the composition or stoichiometry of the compound and predict the structure again; otherwise, in the next step the band gap and the momentum matrix elements will be calculated. Finally, by calculating the linear optical response properties and SHG coefficients, the optical performance of the designed material can be determined.

From cou.: 6 There are some methods to solve the problem of crystal structure prediction, such as simple random sampling, simulated annealing, basin hopping, etc.32 In here, a specialized GA approach is employed to find the low-lying structures on the potential energy surfaces of inorganic crystals; the detailed procedure is also schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. It must be mentioned that the present algorithm differs from the currently well-known USPEX (Universal Structure Prediction: Evolutionary Xtallography) method developed by Oganov's group.33,34 The main feature of our method is that the structural character of the building blocks is taken into account during the GA procedure. Moreover, we will see that this treatment can improve the efficiency and success rate of structure predictions for inorganic materials. The process includes the following steps (Fig. 1):

 ###### 
From cou.: 7 (1) The first stage of the GA procedure is to create the structure of the initial population P(t) (t = 1). In this step, the population size (N) is assigned. In normal GA techniques (also including USPEX), the structure of the initial population is constructed randomly under some constraints (e.g. the smallest distance between two atoms). However, a different method, in which the atomic positions of cations and anions are treated separately, is employed in here; in Fig. 2, the AgGaS2 crystal is used as an example to illustrate the detailed process. We first create the positions of all cations randomly, and then the positions of the anions are determined according to the coordination fashions of the [GaS4]5− building blocks. In the latter step, the configuration of the [GaS4]5− unit (e.g. a perfect tetrahedron) can be defined by providing the Cartesian coordinates of four S anions (the position of the Ga cation is set at the origin). Using this [GaS4]5− unit as a prototype and after rotating it randomly around the z and x axes, we can construct all [GaS4]5− tetrahedra in the cell such that their orientations are arranged randomly (see tetrahedron.m code in the ESI†). Finally, to maintain the stoichiometry of the system and to avoid some anions from getting too close, the excess anions are removed by examining the distance between two nearest-neighbor anions.

First, the remaining individuals are paired with the lowest energy individual of the current generation, and crossover operation is employed to create new points in the search space according to a given probability (Pc). It is noted that only cations are involved in heredity, while the positions of anions are determined by the similar method mentioned in step (1). Then for those individuals that are not involved in heredity, two types of atoms are selected randomly, and their positions are exchanged. Finally, the mutation operation is performed for the above new structures to introduce a perturbation for a selected structural parameter at a given probability (Pm).

During the calculations, the projector-augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials and a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional for exchange and correlation effects were adopted. The convergence thresholds of the energy change and the maximum force for the geometry optimizations were set to 10−5 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. In addition, the spglib package was used to identify the space group of the optimized crystal.38

From Soup: 35 According to eqn (3)–(8) , we have written the corresponding code to calculate the static and dynamic SHG coefficients from the results obtained by VASP program. Since a very dense sampling of the k space and many energy bands are required in the second-order nonlinear susceptibility calculations, it is normally time-consuming to predict the SHG coefficients. Based on Message Passing Interface (MPI), the parallel implementation of the above method for computing SHG coefficients has been realized in our code by distributing data over k -points on each compute core. 43 Additionally, due to the fact that the band gap of the semiconductor or insulator is usually underestimated by the pure DFT method, the correction to the band structure is necessary. In here, the “scissors” approximation proposed by Levine and Allan was employed, 44 which consists of a shift of all the conduction bands by a gap correction. In the following sections the d -tensor defined as d ij = χ abc /2 was used to represent second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, in which Voigt notation indices were introduced to simplify second rank tensors.

From Soup: 37 The silver thiogallate crystal (AgGaS 2 ) is the most common representative NLO crystal in the infrared region (IR) which has been widely used for DFG and OPO. It is well known that AgGaS 2 crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group I 2 d , the so-called chalcopyrite structure. 45 Using the above algorithm, we first predict the low-lying structures on the potential energy surface of AgGaS 2 , and the calculations by the universal USPEX method (version 9.3.9) 33,34 are also performed for comparison. In here, the small and large AgGaS 2 cells are taken into account, which contain 8 and 16 atoms, respectively. In order to examine the performance, each algorithm is run four times, and the population sizes and the maximum number of generations are 10 and 5 for the small cell and 30 and 10 for the large cell, respectively. The parameters adopted in our GA procedure are P e = 0.2, P c = 0.6, and P m = 0.1, while the default settings are used for the USPEX method. The structure of each individual was optimized by employing the PBE functional, and the kinetic energy cutoff for the plane-wave expansion was set to 350 eV.

The Brillouin zone was sampled using the Monkhorst–Pack approximation and a gird of k-points separated by 0.08 Å−1.
From Soup: 38 Before discussing the best individual, it is necessary to evaluate our method to build the structure of the initial population. Using the large AgGaS 2 cell as an example, the average energies of the initial population predicted by USPEX are −59.0342, −59.0157, −58.4865, and −58.3873 eV. However, the lower average energies, −61.2589, −61.1905, −61.0434, and −60.7819 eV, are achieved by applying our method. Therefore, compared with the normal method, in which the structures of the first population are created in a completely randomized manner, the present way can produce more reasonable structures after considering the configurations of the [GaS 4 ] 5− building blocks. Some information on the best individual with the lowest energy obtained by two approaches, including which generation it is observed, the source, and the corresponding space group, is listed in Table 1 . For the small AgGaS 2 cell, the experimental structure (space group I 2 d ) is obtained successfully every time by the present GA; however, at one test running the USPEX fails to yield the experimental structure, instead a metastable phase that adopts the space group Pmc 2 1 is predicted. Additionally, it is worth noting that in most cases (three out of four tests), the experimental structure is quickly located at the first generation. When the large AgGaS 2 cell is employed, although more generations are required, the chalcopyrite phase is still predicted to be the most stable structure every time by the present method. As a comparison, by using USPEX, the experimental structure is achieved only in one out of four tests, and in most cases other metastable structures are obtained within ten generations. The above results show that the present specialized GA method can improve the efficiency and success rate of the structure predictions for the inorganic materials. This is mainly because our method has two advantages over the normal GA technique: (a) it is more reasonable to construct the initial structure of each individual by considering the coordination fashion of the building unit. In other words, we can arrange more individuals around the local minima of the potential energy landscape, and consequently, for a fixed population size, the possibility of finding the stable or metastable states is improved. (b) As a result of this, only cations are involved in the crossover operation; the actual number of atom is reduced during the heredity process, which is advantageous for a system containing more atoms. For instance, although there are 16 atoms in the large AgGaS 2 cell, only eight cations ( i.e. 4 Ag + , and 4 Ga 3+ ions) have taken part in the crossover operation.

From cou.: 39 Before discussing the best individual, it is necessary to evaluate our method to build the structure of the initial population. Using the large AgGaS2 cell as an example, the average energies of the initial population predicted by USPEX are −59.0342, −59.0157, −58.4865, and −58.3873 eV. However, the lower average energies, −61.2589, −61.1905, −61.0434, and −60.7819 eV, are achieved by applying our method. Therefore, compared with the normal method, in which the structures of the first population are created in a completely randomized manner, the present way can produce more reasonable structures after considering the configurations of the [GaS4]5− building blocks. Some information on the best individual with the lowest energy obtained by two approaches, including which generation it is observed, the source, and the corresponding space group, is listed in Table 1. For the small AgGaS2 cell, the experimental structure (space group I2d) is obtained successfully every time by the present GA; however, at one test running the USPEX fails to yield the experimental structure, instead a metastable phase that adopts the space group Pmc21 is predicted. Additionally, it is worth noting that in most cases (three out of four tests), the experimental structure is quickly located at the first generation. When the large AgGaS2 cell is employed, although more generations are required, the chalcopyrite phase is still predicted to be the most stable structure every time by the present method. As a comparison, by using USPEX, the experimental structure is achieved only in one out of four tests, and in most cases other metastable structures are obtained within ten generations. The above results show that the present specialized GA method can improve the efficiency and success rate of the structure predictions for the inorganic materials. This is mainly because our method has two advantages over the normal GA technique: (a) it is more reasonable to construct the initial structure of each individual by considering the coordination fashion of the building unit. In other words, we can arrange more individuals around the local minima of the potential energy landscape, and consequently, for a fixed population size, the possibility of finding the stable or metastable states is improved. (b) As a result of this, only cations are involved in the crossover operation; the actual number of atom is reduced during the heredity process, which is advantageous for a system containing more atoms. For instance, although there are 16 atoms in the large AgGaS2 cell, only eight cations (i.e. 4 Ag+, and 4 Ga3+ ions) have taken part in the crossover operation.
From Soup: 39 By comparing the total energy of each individual, three low-lying structures of AgGaS 2 crystals shown in Fig. 3 are found within 0.1 eV per formula unit; the corresponding space group, lattice parameters, fractional atomic positions, lengths of Ga–S bonds, and relative energy are summarized in Table 2 . It is interesting that all three structures are noncentrosymmetric, implying that silver thiogallate tends to crystallize in polar phases at normal pressure. Although in these structures the [GaS 4 ] 5− tetrahedra are connected to each other via corner-sharing, the detailed configurations and alignments of the [GaS 4 ] 5− tetrahedra are different. For the most stable I 2 d phase, all [GaS 4 ] 5− tetrahedra have the same orientation and the lengths of the four Ga–S bonds are identical. While in the Pna 2 1 structure ( Fig. 3b ), which is only 11.87 meV per formula higher in energy, the [GaS 4 ] 5− tetrahedra are slightly distorted and show two different orientations along the c axis. As far as the third low-lying structure ( Fig. 3c ) is concerned, it features a layered packing of the [GaS 4 ] 5− tetrahedra separated by Ag + cations, whereas in the I 2 d and Pna 2 1 phases the [GaS 4 ] 5− tetrahedral units are connected to each other via corner-sharing to form a three-dimensional framework.

From Soup: 40 After obtaining the stable structure with a noncentrosymmetric arrangement, we then can explore the optical properties of the AgGaS 2 crystal with the I 2 d phase. In this step, a very dense k -point mesh of (21 × 21 × 21) (resulting in 4631 k points in the first Brillouin zone) was employed to guarantee the convergence of the results of the linear and nonlinear optical responses; the energy cutoff for those empty energy bands involved in the calculations was taken to be at least 30 eV above the valence band maximum. Moreover, to overcome the well-known band gap problem of the DFT method, a scissor operator of 1.73 eV was applied to reproduce the experimental band gap of 2.64 eV. 46

From Soup: 41 For the linear optical response, AgGaS 2 with the tetragonal phase is an uniaxial crystal, and there are two dielectric tensor components corresponding to the electric field perpendicular and parallel to the c -axis ( ε ⊥ ( ω ) and ε // ( ω ), respectively). The predicted complex dielectric functions for the most stable I 2 d structure are displayed in Fig. 4a and b . From the dielectric function, the refractive indices, n ⊥ ( ω ) and n // ( ω ), can be obtained, and then the birefringence Δ n ( ω ) can be determined from the difference between the two refractive indices, which are also shown in Fig. 4c and d , respectively. Additionally, the corresponding static dielectric constants ( ε (0)), refractive indices ( n (0)), and birefringence (Δ n (0)) are listed in Table 3 , and the results of other theoretical studies and some available experimental values for AgGaS 2 with the I 2 d structure are also shown for comparison. 47–51 The calculated refractive indices in the present work agree well with the values of experimental measurements, while the results obtained in other theoretical studies are somewhat overestimated. From Fig. 4d , it can be seen that the negative birefringence is predicted when the wavelength ( λ ) is larger than 0.490 μm ( i.e. 2.53 eV). This critical wavelength is also in good agreement with the experimental observation that AgGaS 2 is a negative uniaxial crystal at λ > 0.497 μm. 49 As for the SHG response of AgGaS 2 in the chalcopyrite phase, there are only two independent components of the SHG tensor, namely, d 14 and d 36 . In the static limit, these two components are equal according to the Kleinman symmetry, and our calculated result of 17.47 pm V −1 is very close to the experimental value of 18 ± 2.7 pm V −1 (at 10.63 μm). 51 Therefore, the method mentioned in section 2.3 is suitable for predicting the optical properties of semiconductors. We also calculate the frequency-dependent SHG coefficient of AgGaS 2 by using eqn (7) and (8) , and the result is displayed in Fig. 5a . At the beginning when the energy is less than 1.0 eV, the d 36 coefficient increases slowly. As the energy increases further, the SHG response rapidly increases, and it exhibits a maximum value of 51.17 pm V −1 at about 1.38 eV in the IR region.

From Soup: 42 To see how the structure of the [GaS 4 ] 5− building units affects the optical performance of the AgGaS 2 crystal, we also investigate the optical properties of AgGaS 2 crystallized in the Pna 2 1 and Pmc 2 1 structures. In the case of the Pna 2 1 phase, a (15 × 12 × 15) k -point mesh that yields 1351 k points in the first Brillouin zone was employed. For this metastable structure, a direct band gap of 1.06 eV is obtained, about 0.15 eV larger than the gap of the I 2 d structure. The Pna 2 1 phase is a biaxial crystal, and there are three dielectric tensor components, and if the same scissor energy (1.73 eV) was used, the calculated static dielectric constants would be ε xx (0) = 6.121, ε yy (0) = 6.179, ε zz (0) = 6.254. Correspondingly, the three static refractive indices are n xx (0) = 2.474, n yy (0) = 2.486, n zz (0) = 2.501, resulting in Δ n (0) = 0.027. The small magnitude of birefringence implies the poor performance and phase matchability of the Pna 2 1 phase. The frequency-dependent SHG coefficient for the highest tensor of the Pna 2 1 phase ( d 33 ) is shown in Fig. 5a and compared with that of the I 2 d structure; it was found that the SHG response becomes weak at the near-IR region. For another metastable Pmc 2 1 structure that is composed of the layered packing of the [GaS 4 ] 5− blocks, a small direct band gap of 0.69 eV is predicted, and when the same scissor energy is employed, the magnitude of Δ n (0) is about 0.089. This increase in the birefringence is consistent with the fact that the layered arrangement of the [GaS 4 ] 5− units favors strong optical anisotropy. Additionally, according to the frequency-dependent SHG coefficient displayed in Fig. 5a , it seems that the SHG response is enhanced at the far-IR region. Therefore, the configuration and the packing mode of the [GaS 4 ] 5− blocks have obvious effects on the optical properties of AgGaS 2 , including the transparency range, the phase matchability and the strength of the SHG response.

From Soup: 43 It is well known that chalcogenide compounds usually have a small band gap and high second-order nonlinearity, so they are good candidates for NLO materials in the IR region. In recent years, many promising chalcogenide compounds have been discovered with novel compositions and crystal structures, which can be used to produce the next generation of NLO materials in the IR region ( e.g. , see a recent review by Chung and Kanatzidis 21 ). Among them, a new class of polar semiconductors, AAsSe 2 (A = Li, Na), have been synthesized. 5 The main structural feature of these chalcogenides is the infinite single chains of 1 ∞ [AsSe 2 − ] derived from corner-sharing pyramidal asymmetric [AsSe 3 ] 3− units. For NaAsSe 2 , a very strong SHG response in the wavelength range of 600–950 nm has been observed experimentally, and several theoretical studies have also confirmed the experimental results that NaAsSe 2 has a large static SHG coefficient of more than 300 pm V −1 . 5,52,53 In the present work, we will focus on the structure and optical properties of another alkali-metal chalcogenide, LiAsSe 2 . For the primitive cell of LiAsSe 2 , there are two Li, two As, and four Se atoms. The parameters used in the GA procedure are t max = 50, N = 12, P e = 0.2, P c = 0.6, and P m = 0.1. During the DFT/PBE calculations, the kinetic energy cutoff for the plane-wave expansion was set to 264.4 eV, and the k -point separation was about 0.08 Å −1 .

From Soup: 44 With respect to the abovementioned AgGaS 2 , the crystal structure of LiAsSe 2 is somewhat complicated. By examining the geometries of those individuals with low energies, as shown in Fig. 6 , three stable phases of LiAsSe 2 are predicted, which crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric space groups Pm (no. 6), Cc (no. 9), and Pmc 2 1 (no. 26). The corresponding structural parameters and the relative energy per LiAsSe 2 formula are listed in Table 4 . In here, the relative energies are calculated at dense k -point meshes with a separation of about 0.01 Å −1 . For the fourth structure, it belongs to the space group P 2 1 with a quasi-cubic unit cell (see Table S1 in the ESI † ), and due to the fact that this structure has higher energy (about 30 meV per formula with respect to the Pm phase), the corresponding results are not shown. Among them, the structure in the space group Cc has been experimentally reported. 5 Furthermore, to check the dynamic stability of the predicted Pm and Pmc 2 1 structures, their phonon dispersion curves are also calculated, and no imaginary frequency is observed (see Fig. S1 in the ESI † ), implying that both phases are dynamically stable.

From Soup: 45 As shown in Fig. 6 , the [AsSe 3 ] 3− pyramid provides the basic building blocks for all three stable structures, and via corner-bridging the one-dimensional 1 ∞ [AsSe 2 − ] chains are formed. In each [AsSe 3 ] 3− trigonal pyramid, it has two different Se atoms, namely, the terminal and bridging Se atoms. Although according to the lengths of the two types of As–Se bonds ( Table 4 ) the configurations of the AsSe 3 building units are quite analogous, various conformations of the 1 ∞ [AsSe 2 − ] chains are observed in different crystal structures. In the Pm and Pmc 2 1 phases, the orientations of the [AsSe 3 ] 3− units of the single chain are the same, and as a result the pyramids are arranged in an ordered fashion. However, it must be mentioned that the relative orientations between two 1 ∞ [AsSe 2 − ] chains in the unit cell of Pmc 2 1 are different (see Fig. 6c ). Unlike the Pm and Pmc 2 1 phases, there are two orientations of the [AsSe 3 ] 3− blocks observed within a single chain of the Cc structure, and now the pyramids show a zigzag alignment. Actually, for the fourth structure with the space group P 2 1 , it adopts another different zigzag conformation of 1 ∞ [AsSe 2 − ] chains (see Table S1 in the ESI † ). From the relative energies of the three structures shown in Table 4 , it is interesting that the energy difference among them is quite small (<4.0 meV per formula). Thus, we can expect that the above three phases would coexist from a thermodynamical point of view. This result is consistent with the experimental findings that the 1 ∞ [AsSe 2 − ] single chain exhibits remarkable conformational flexibility and is readily influenced by the synthetic conditions as well as the alkali-metal species. 5

From Soup: 46 Considering the fact that the above three structures are noncentrosymmetric and the packing of asymmetric [AsSe 3 ] 3− units are different, LiAsSe 2 provides a rare example that can be used to explore how the conformational change of the building units affects the optical properties of the material. In the optical response calculations, the sizes of the k -point mesh of the Pm , Cc and Pmc 2 1 phases were set to (25 × 26 × 17), (20 × 20 × 20), and (25 × 25 × 9), respectively, corresponding to 5526, 4004, and 2813 k points in the first Brillouin zone. The calculated minimum band gaps of the three compounds at the PBE level are listed in Table 5 , and by comparing the experimentally measured band gap (1.11 eV) of the Cc structure, 5 a scissor operator of 0.44 eV was employed in the optical calculations of the three systems. For the linear optical response, the dielectric tensors of these biaxial crystals are calculated along the principal optical axes, and the results of LiAsSe 2 with the Pm structure are presented in Fig. 7a and b (see Fig. S2 and S3 in the ESI † for the Cc and Pmc 2 1 phases). The frequency-dependent dielectric function of the Pm structure shows strong anisotropy in the IR region, resulting in the significant difference among three static dielectric constants that are ε xx (0) = 8.791, ε yy (0) = 16.753, and ε zz (0) = 23.560 ( Table 5 ). The sharp peaks of the imaginary part of ε zz observed in the IR region can be mainly assigned to the transitions from Se 4p to As 4p states. As a consequence of the anisotropy of the dielectric functions, the curves of refractive indices ( Fig. 7c ) also exhibit strong anisotropy. In the IR region, the sequence of the three refractive indices is n xx < n yy < n zz , and the values of n xx (0), n yy (0), and n zz (0) are 2.965, 4.093, and 4.854, respectively. Since n zz is significantly larger than n xx , high values of birefringence (Δ n ) of the Pm structure can be expected. At the static limit, a value of 1.889 is calculated for Δ n (0) ( Table 5 ), and as displayed in Fig. 7d , the birefringence is larger than 1.8 in the IR region, suggesting that the LiAsSe 2 crystal in the space group Pm is phase-matchable in this region. However, unfortunately, the above large birefringence will require a very narrow acceptance angle of the incident light, which is particularly unfavorable for practical application in the NLO field. Similar results for the linear optical response are obtained for the Cc and Pmc 2 1 phases, and especially they also show high birefringence in the IR region (see Fig. 7d ). It is obvious that the strong anisotropic feature of the LiAsSe 2 crystal with different phases is directly related to the one-dimensional structure of 1 ∞ [AsSe 2 − ] chains, and the degree of anisotropy presents a strong correlation with the chain conformations. The strongest anisotropy is observed for the Pm and Pmc 2 1 structures with the same orientation of each [AsSe 3 ] 3− pyramid within a chain, while the Cc structure shows relatively weak anisotropy due to the zigzag packing pattern of the [AsSe 3 ] 3− pyramids ( Fig. 6 ). As shown in Fig. 7d , the maximum birefringence of the Pm and Pmc 2 1 structures is about 3.9, and it is ~1.6 times larger than that of the Cc structure.

As shown in Fig. 7d, the maximum birefringence of the Pm and Pmc21 structures is about 3.9, and it is ~1.6 times larger than that of the Cc structure.
From Soup: 47 Now, let us discuss the SHG responses of the three LiAsSe 2 crystals. Based on the space groups and the Kleinman symmetry, at the static limit, there are 6, 6, and 3 non-vanishing independent SHG coefficients for LiAsSe 2 crystallized in the space groups Pm , Cc and Pmc 2 1 , respectively. As listed in Table 5 , the static SHG coefficients with the highest magnitudes of the three compounds are d 34 (= d 23 ) for Pm , d 33 for Cc , and d 11 for Pmc 2 1 structures, with the values of 1379.57, 737.72, and 141.36 pm V −1 , respectively. The frequency-dependent variations of these SHG tensors are plotted in Fig. 5b . In the mid-IR and far-IR regions, the magnitudes of the above SHG coefficients tend to follow a sequence of Pm > Cc > Pmc 2 1 , and the position of the peak maximum is blue-shifted in the same order. It is worth emphasizing that besides the relatively small value of the band gap, the extremely strong nonlinear SHG response observed for the Pm structure is also associated with special arrangement of the [AsSe 3 ] 3− pyramids. Since the intensity of the second-order susceptibility for a polar material is directly related to the net dipole moment of the unit cell, 54 it is necessary to compare the alignment of the dipole moment of the asymmetric [AsSe 3 ] 3− unit in the three structures (the dipole moment of the spherical Li 1+ cation is zero). In here, a simple bond-valence approach 55 is used to estimate the direction and magnitude of the dipole moment of the [AsSe 3 ] 3− group; for simplicity, the contribution of As 3+ lone pair electrons is not considered. Due to the resemblance in the configuration, the dipole moment of the individual [AsSe 3 ] 3− group of these three phases is similar (in the range from 26.2 to 27.2 Debye). The calculated microscopic dipole moments of different LiAsSe 2 crystals are listed in Table 6 , and the corresponding directions are represented by graphical arrows in Fig. 8 . It is noted that for the Cc and Pmc 2 1 structures, there are two [AsSe 3 ] 3− groups in the primitive cell, which belong to the same and different 1 ∞ [AsSe 2 − ] chains ( Fig. 6 ), respectively. For the Pm structure, the dipole moments of the [AsSe 3 ] 3− groups align in the same direction ( Fig. 8a ) to give a polar structure without cancellation of the individual moments, and thus the maximum magnitude of the total microscopic dipole (0.295 Debye per volume) is achieved. However, in the Cc structure ( Fig. 8b ), the different orientation of the adjacent [AsSe 3 ] 3− groups within a chain leads to partial cancellation of the neighboring dipole moments. As shown in Table 6 , the component of the dipole moment along the y -axis entirely cancels each other, resulting a microscopic dipole moment with moderate magnitude (0.224 Debye per volume). Another different type of dipole–dipole interaction is observed for the Pmc 2 1 structure ( Fig. 8c ), in which the cancellation of the neighboring dipole moments is interchained along the y -axis. In this case, a relatively small magnitude of the microscopic dipole moment (0.136 Debye per volume) is predicted. From the above results, the dipole moments of the three LiAsSe 2 crystals increase in the order of Pmc 2 1 < Cc < Pm , and correspondingly the intensity of the SHG response is enhanced, following the same trend of polarizability. Therefore, it is evident that the large SHG coefficient obtained for the Pm space group mainly originated from the same alignment of all [AsSe 3 ] 3− trigonal pyramids with no cancellation of the individual moments. Although, as pointed above, the strong anisotropy of this series of crystals causes the limitation in NLO applications, the excellent birefringence property makes LiAsSe 2 crystals as potential candidates for applications in the field of optical polarization.

From Soup: 48 In this work, we propose a calculational method to design inorganic NLO crystals, which takes into account the stable crystal structure predictions by a specialized GA technique and the theoretical calculations of the static and frequency-dependent SHG coefficients. This new method has been validated by applying it to two typical systems, AgGaS 2 and LiAsSe 2 crystals. The experimental structure, linear and nonlinear optical properties of AgGaS 2 are well reproduced, while for LiAsSe 2 , besides the experimental structure in the Cc phase, two other stable structures are predicted by our method; especially, the structure crystallized in the Pm space group shows a remarkable birefringence feature and a very strong SHG response in the IR region. The present results clearly demonstrate that our method can provide an effective way to find new inorganic NLO materials, provided that the composition of the system and the coordination fashions of the building units are known beforehand. Further studies on designing more complicated inorganic NLO crystals are in progress.
