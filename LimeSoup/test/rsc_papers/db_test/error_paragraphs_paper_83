From cou.: 2 The author regrets an error in the text beginning on line 5 of page 16461. The corrected text is as follows:
From Soup: 2 This tends to support the hypothesis of a contribution of a unique cerium center, probably Ce1. In fact, the unfavorable electrostatic coordination environment of Ce2 probably makes it silent from the dynamic point of view.
