From cou.: 1 A reduced form of a synthetic hydrogen-assembled molecular shuttle for nano-technological applications has been investigated by molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations. It is composed by a benzylic amide macrocycle mechanically locked onto a thread in acetonitrile solution. Classical sampling indicates, in agreement with experimental findings, that in equilibrium condition at 298 K the macrocycle and the naphthalimide radical anion moiety within the thread strongly interact forming four strong OCN–H–OCNR hydrogen bonds. Simulations also revealed that the geometry of the supramolecular assembly reversibly oscillates between unfolded and folded conformations, with the latter characterized by an electrostatic hook involving the succinamide end group and the macrocycle itself. Finally, the simulated UV-Vis absorption spectra for free and complexed reduced naphthalimide quantitatively confirm that the transient spectroscopic change experimentally used as a probe for monitoring the translational motion of the macrocycle, from succinamide to naphthalimide stations, accompanying the selective electrochemical reduction.

From cou.: 2 Miniaturization, design and synthesis of multicomponent molecular devices at nanoscale dimensions is one of the most challenging research areas in modern science. Inspired by the ability of some biological systems in nature, such as ATP synthase,1 Titin (also known as Connectin)2 or Myosin,3 to efficiently convert chemical energy into molecular movements, various types of artificial molecular devices and machines4 have been developed in recent decades such as molecular switches,5 elevators,6 valves,7 rotors,8 propellers,9 walkers,10 springs,11 and shuttles.12,13 Many interesting strategies and concepts concerning the control of molecular-level movements by external inputs (chemical reagents, pH-variation, electrochemical reduction, UV-Vis radiation) have been successfully addressed by different research groups. The basic feature which enables a molecule to mimic functions of a macroscopic machinery, usually resides in the ability of certain nano-scale “objects” to funnel an ad hoc external perturbation in controlled conformational rearrangements. For example, in a very recent application Feringa and co-workers reported that a light-driven molecular rotor may also be chemically blocked by external signals (i.e. an acid/base triggered variation of the protonation state of an ammonium group in a “rotating arm”).14

From cou.: 3 Recently, several experiments have also suggested that the solvent may heavily influence the conformational flexibility of molecular devices and machines, thus affecting in many cases the active stimuli-responsive submolecular motions.15 Following the huge amount of exciting experimental data in recent years, the necessity of a rigorous theoretical/computational modelling for initiating a rational design and synthesis of molecular-based machineries of increasing efficiency has been emerging. Obviously, any serious modelling must necessarily maintain the intrinsic configurational complexity of these molecular systems.

From cou.: 5 In recent years, part of our efforts have been focussed on this fascinating research area with some computational investigations concerning the thermodynamics17 and kinetics18 of an electrochemically-driven conformational switching mechanism occurring in a synthetic thread in solution. The thread we studied was previously reported in the literature as a molecular component of a fast and reversible hydrogen-bonded molecular shuttle13 consisting of a succinamide (succ) chemical group, a C12 alkyl-spacer and a 3,6-di-tert-butyl-1,8-naphthalimide (ni) moiety, see Fig. 1a. Our simulations were able to suggest that such a thread, even though originally designed to be involved in a more complex device, may efficiently work in solution as a tens of nanoseconds time scale two-states molecular switch under electrochemical control.17,18 Note that, in analogy with the work accomplished by Brouwer et al.,13 in our computational setup we were assuming the same external stimulus (i.e.reduction/oxidation of ni) but we completely disregarded the presence of the macrocycle (see Fig. 1b).

From cou.: 6 As a continuation of such a research work, in the present paper we report a computational study dealing with the hydrogen-assembled molecular rotaxane reported in ref. 13. In particular, we investigated its reduced form at equilibrium conditions in which, on the basis of experimental evidences, the naphthalimide is present as the radical anion and surrounded by the benzylic amide macrocycle (bam). With the precise aim of analyzing the existence of the H-bonding motif, which is supposed to be the non-covalent driving force behind the shuttling process (from succ to ni−) of the macrocycle upon electrochemical reduction,13 we have carried out a 0.1 microseconds molecular dynamics simulations starting from the rotaxane in the conformation as reported in Fig. 1b. Hence, the position of the macrocycle along the thread as well as the electrostatic interactions with succ and ni− stations are then investigated. Some insights about the conformational flexibility of the overall supramolecular assembly will be also reported. Finally, the photoabsorption spectra of ni− and ni−/bam interacting couple have been estimated by means of Conductor-like Polarizable Continuum Method (CPCM)19 and Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) calculations.20 This enabled us to: (i) investigate the effects of noncovalent interactions on the UV-Vis absorption maxima characteristic of the naphthalimide radical anion; (ii) compare the variation of the calculated absorption peak (at around 415 nm) with the experimentally proposed one suggested to provide a direct measure of the relative position of the macrocycle with respect to the succ and ni− stations.13

From cou.: 7 As a first step, to shed some light on the conformations sampled by the reduced form of the rotaxane shown in Fig. 1b, we performed a MD simulation of 100 ns at 298 K in an NVT ensemble and in acetonitrile (i.e.CH3CN) dilute solution.21 Such a simulation was started considering the molecular shuttle at the centre of a rectangular box of 21 nm3 filled with solvent molecules at the typical liquid density of 782.2 kg m−3 (see Fig. 1 reported in ESI†).21 In this respect, in line with experimental findings,13 we started the simulation with the elongated molecular thread and the benzylic amide macrocycle confined on the niradical anion species (see for example the molecular structure depicted in Fig. 1b). Such a choice was imposed by the observed microsecond time scale of the induced shuttling process in solution.13

From cou.: 8 In line with the same procedure successfully applied to study the succ–[C12 alkyl spacer]–ni thread in solution17,18 we modelled the rotaxane using the standard Gromos96 force field22 in conjunction with atomic point charges refined by means of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations23 with the popular Becke's three-parameter Lee–Yang–Parr exchange functional (B3LYP).24 Obviously, at variance with our previous investigations,17 the charge distribution of the macrocycle was to be defined. Therefore, we introduced in the force field parameters for the bamgroup the point charges as obtained by applying the RESP fitting procedure25 in conjunction with the optimized geometry at B3LYP/6-31G*/CPCM level of theory and related converged electronic wavefunction. In this respect, before doing any classical/statistical sampling in dilute solution, CPCM19 represents a reasonable and well-known computational tool for evaluating the polarization of the surrounding environment on a solute molecule in its own electronic ground state.26 DFT(B3LYP)-CPCM computations were performed using the Gaussian03 package.27

From cou.: 9 The investigated system was then gradually heated from 50 K to 298 K using short (100 ps) MD simulations upon solvent relaxation via the steepest descent algorithm. After equilibration, a fully-classical MD trajectory was then propagated up to 100 ns using an integration step of 2.0 fs. The temperature was kept constant applying the Berendsen thermostat28 (with a time constant of 0.2 ps). Long range electrostatic interactions were computed by the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method,29 with 34 wave vectors in each dimension and a 4th order cubic interpolation. A cut-off of 1.1 nm was used for nonbonded interactions and the pair list was updated every 5 integration steps. All the MD simulations were carried out using the Gromacs software.30

From cou.: 10 The conformational flexibility in solution of the synthetic rotaxane depicted in Fig. 1b during the explored time range has been characterized by monitoring the position and the relative orientation of the macrocycle along the thread. Particular attention was also given to the mechanical behaviour of the succ–[C12 alkyl spacer]–ni artificial thread. To this end, inspired by our recent works,17,18 we dumped along the 100 ns MD simulation the distance between the geometrical centres of the three main internal groups that are the succ and ni− stations, and the mechanically locked benzylic amide macrocycle (see Fig. 1b). Thus, the trajectories of the inter-moieties (i.e. succ-ni−, succ-bam and bam–ni−) distances along the simulation as well as the emerged normalized probability distributions have been calculated and discussed. The time evolution of these set of internal variables allowed us to point out two basic structural features of the currently investigated rotaxane: (i) the deviation (if any) of the molecular thread from a conformational basin in which it is assumed to be found in a fully elongated structure (as for example implicitly reported in Fig. 1b), and (ii) the position of the macrocycle with respect to the ni− H-bonded acceptor unit. This may be viewed as an interesting structural parameter to be compared with experimental data supporting the existence of a strong electrostatic glue which has the effect to confine the bamgroup around the reduced moiety.13

From Soup: 23 At last, the conformational analysis carried out in solution at 298 K has been further extended applying the essential dynamics ( ED ) technique. 31 In this context, in the light of the results reported below (subsection 3.1) we have taken into account only the succ –[C 12 alkyl spacer]– ni − thread. This means that we have computed, and then diagonalized, a covariance matrix of the atomic positional fluctuations using a filtered trajectory containing the coordinates of the molecular thread as extracted from the entire MD sampling. The diagonalization procedure of such a covariance matrix allows us to define a new set of generalized coordinates ( i.e. the eigenvectors) along which the atomic motions occur. As usual the eigenvectors with the largest associated eigenvalues form the so called essential subspace, featuring the largest amplitude (concerted) conformational fluctuations occurring in the simulated supramolecular assembly . 31

From Soup: 24 In order to address the transient nature of the blue shift in the naphthalimide radical anion absorption maximum (from 415 nm to almost 410 nm in MeCN at 298 K) supposed to be caused by the translation of the macrocycle along the succ –[C 12 alkyl spacer]– ni thread to its new equilibrium position, 13 we computed the UV-Vis photo- absorption spectra of this chromophore in two different conditions: (i) free ni radical anion in MeCN, and (ii) ni radical anion/ macrocycle supramolecular complex ( i.e. ni − / bam interacting couple) in MeCN. The first simulation condition agrees well with the experimental evidence suggesting that without any external input ( i.e. neutral rotaxane ) the macrocycle lies almost completely toward succ moiety. 13 On the other hand, the situation termed as (ii) should plausibly represent the situation in which the bam , once has been realized the irreversible electrochemically-driven shuttling movement from succ to ni − , plays a key role in stabilizing the radical anion species in solution during its lifetime. For this purpose, we performed Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) 20 calculations mimicking the solvent as a dielectric continuum and polarizable via the CPCM algorithm. 19 TD-DFT electronic excitations were obtained within the random-phase approximation (RPA), 20 using an unrestricted formalism and two different gradient-corrected functionals: PBE0 32 and PW91. 33,34 We first evaluated the corresponding optimized geometries for both ni − and ni − / bam in MeCN using the aforementioned functionals in conjunction with the 6-311++G(d,p) 35 atomic basis set on the ni chemical group, whereas the macrocycle was modelled using a 6-311++G(d,p) basis set for the four N–H moieties and the 3-21G(d,p) one for the remaining part. It is worth noting that TD-DFT calculations 20 were carried out retaining the same level of computation used for geometry optimizations in MeCN. As a conclusive remark we would like to underline that the ni − / bam interacting couple was taken properly into account for such calculations only upon having carefully analysed the conformations sampled by means of the MD technique (see subsection 3.1). In other words, in this context the classical sampling at 298 K in an explicit solution environment results fundamentally in establishing the starting conformation needed for the geometry optimization procedure, thus avoiding any a priori assumption about the local interacting supramolecular partners ( i.e. ni − and bam ).

From Soup: 25 The time evolution of the succ – ni − , succ – bam and bam – ni − geometrical center distances during the simulation in MeCN are depicted in Fig. 2 . As it can be clearly observed, the succ – ni − and succ – bam distances appear rather correlated. A deeper analysis evidences that in the case of the succ – bam variable its time-dependency can be statistically summarized by means of a bimodal distribution showing a large peak at almost 15.5 Å featuring a shoulder at 13.0 Å, and a second peak, less intense, centred at shorter distances ( i.e. about 9.0 Å, see the dashed line in Fig. 3 ). Such a result is due to the presence of two different conformational states basically differing for the mutual orientation of the succ –[C 12 alkyl spacer] covalent framework with respect to the ni − / bam supramolecular moiety. In other words, during the dynamics at 298 K the simulated succ –[C 12 alkyl spacer]– ni − / bam rotaxane rapidly interconverts its conformational shape passing through elongated and folded molecular geometries as reported in Fig. 4 . Interestingly, the same internal flexibility of the C 12 alkyl spacer (see Fig. 1a ), coupled with the enhanced H-bond-accepting affinity of the ni station accompanying its electrochemical reduction , 36 was found to be a key structural feature allowing such a thread to work as a two-states molecular device in solution. 17 Furthermore, in analogy to what happens for succ – bam , the succ – ni − normalized distribution depicted in Fig. 3 seems to confirm the aforementioned picture. The double peak profile at almost 18.0 Å is due to elongated conformations of the molecular thread while the shoulder falling at 15.0 Å arises from partially folded molecular geometries. 17b Conformations showing succ –ni − internal distances lower than 12.0 Å are found to be folded because of an OCN–H–O CNR electrostatic contact (termed as #5 in Fig. 4 ) between the succ station and the macrocycle which, in our simulation conditions, surrounds the ni − chemical group (see the blue solid line in Fig. 2 showing the trajectory of the bam – ni − geometrical distance and the related narrow distribution depicted in Fig. 3 ). During the 100 ns of MD carried out on succ –[C 12 alkyl spacer]– ni − / bam rotaxane at 298 K, the benzylic amide macrocycle stays in proximity of the ni radical anion (the bam – ni − inter-moieties trajectory reported in Fig. 2 results in an average distance of 3.5 Å with a standard deviation of 0.3 Å). In particular, we found that the macrocycle remains locally confined within the ni -side region of the thread forming, in the simulated ensemble, an electrostatic network composed by four hydrogen bonding interactions termed in Fig. 4 as #1–#4. It is worth noting that our MD simulation confirms the hypothesis raised by the experimental measurements attributing the shift, at more positive value, of the potential needed to re-oxidate ni − to ni in such a synthetic rotaxane to the formation of four or three extremely strong hydrogen bonds (OCN–H–O CNR). 13

From cou.: 26 The time evolution of the succ–ni−, succ–bam and bam–ni− geometrical center distances during the simulation in MeCN are depicted in Fig. 2. As it can be clearly observed, the succ–ni− and succ–bam distances appear rather correlated. A deeper analysis evidences that in the case of the succ–bam variable its time-dependency can be statistically summarized by means of a bimodal distribution showing a large peak at almost 15.5 Å featuring a shoulder at 13.0 Å, and a second peak, less intense, centred at shorter distances (i.e. about 9.0 Å, see the dashed line in Fig. 3). Such a result is due to the presence of two different conformational states basically differing for the mutual orientation of the succ–[C12 alkyl spacer] covalent framework with respect to the ni−/bam supramolecular moiety. In other words, during the dynamics at 298 K the simulated succ–[C12 alkyl spacer]–ni−/bam rotaxane rapidly interconverts its conformational shape passing through elongated and folded molecular geometries as reported in Fig. 4. Interestingly, the same internal flexibility of the C12 alkyl spacer (see Fig. 1a), coupled with the enhanced H-bond-accepting affinity of the ni station accompanying its electrochemical reduction,36 was found to be a key structural feature allowing such a thread to work as a two-states molecular device in solution.17 Furthermore, in analogy to what happens for succ–bam, the succ–ni− normalized distribution depicted in Fig. 3 seems to confirm the aforementioned picture. The double peak profile at almost 18.0 Å is due to elongated conformations of the molecular thread while the shoulder falling at 15.0 Å arises from partially folded molecular geometries.17b Conformations showing succ–ni− internal distances lower than 12.0 Å are found to be folded because of an OCN–H–OCNR electrostatic contact (termed as #5 in Fig. 4) between the succ station and the macrocycle which, in our simulation conditions, surrounds the ni− chemical group (see the blue solid line in Fig. 2 showing the trajectory of the bam–ni− geometrical distance and the related narrow distribution depicted in Fig. 3). During the 100 ns of MD carried out on succ–[C12 alkyl spacer]–ni−/bam rotaxane at 298 K, the benzylic amide macrocycle stays in proximity of the niradical anion (the bam–ni− inter-moieties trajectory reported in Fig. 2 results in an average distance of 3.5 Å with a standard deviation of 0.3 Å). In particular, we found that the macrocycle remains locally confined within the ni-side region of the thread forming, in the simulated ensemble, an electrostatic network composed by four hydrogen bonding interactions termed in Fig. 4 as #1–#4. It is worth noting that our MD simulation confirms the hypothesis raised by the experimental measurements attributing the shift, at more positive value, of the potential needed to re-oxidateni− to ni in such a synthetic rotaxane to the formation of four or three extremely strong hydrogen bonds (OCN–H–OCNR).13

In the case of the reduced thread in MeCN studied in our previous works, 17,18 i.e. succ –[C 12 alkyl spacer]– ni − , we showed that starting from the elongated conformational basin of the neutral species, the system undergoes a complete and irreversible conformational rearrangement upon selective reduction of ni exhibiting folded conformations stabilized by a strong hydrogen bonding interaction involving the succ and ni − two end groups . 17b In the present case, we observe from Fig. 5 that when the reduced rotaxane is considered the succ –[C 12 alkyl spacer]– ni − / bam system may be mainly found in linear conformations in rapid equilibrium with folded counterparts. Therefore, if compared to the previous investigations, 17,18 the presence of the macrocycle appears to prevent the formation of a direct electrostatic link connecting the two stations which, as already reported in ref. 17 and 36 , could plausibly provide a strong noncovalent interaction capable to favour folded conformations in MeCN solution. In the simulated conditions at 298 K, a Δ A c value equal to +2 kJ mol −1 at R succ–ni distance of 10 Å (see the Helmholtz free energy profile shown in Fig. 5 ) suggests a spontaneous character of the reversible folded → elongated conformational fluctuation occurring in such a rotaxane in MeCN. It is also interesting to highlight that the supramolecular forces between ni − and bam remarkably affect the accessible conformational space of the molecular thread, in particular reducing the extent of the folding-like movement of the C 12 alkyl spacer. 17

From Soup: 27 A more general and less-biased view of the conformational repertoire has been further addressed using the essential dynamics ( ED ) technique. 31 In the light of the results reported above we took into account only the succ –[C 12 alkyl spacer]– ni − thread. The all-atom eigenvalues spectrum reported in Fig. 6 clearly shows that the conformational changes exhibited by the succ –[C 12 alkyl spacer]– ni − framework in the molecular shuttle are dominated by the first two eigenvectors which account for 45% and 15% of total variance, respectively. The nature of these eigenvector has been evaluated by extracting a subset of different molecular structures obtained projecting the classical trajectory onto the first two essential eigenvectors, and the result is summarized in Fig. 7a and b . It is clear that, in line with the previously reported picture, the most relevant fluctuations are associated to elongation/folding like mechanical movements of the reduced succ –[C 12 alkyl spacer]– ni − framework. The main differences emerged by the analysis of these eigenvectors basically reside in the fluctuation occurring with respect to the naphthalimide molecular plane: the first eigenvector is seen to fluctuate (see Fig. 7a ) along regions which may be schematically identified as “orthogonal” with respect to such a molecular plane, while the second one (see Fig. 7b ) spans “parallel” or near “parallel” regions. This finding provides a further evidence concerning the conformational flexibility of the synthetic thread as a molecular component of the proposed hydrogen-bonded shuttle operating in solution at room temperature. 13 It is also interesting to mention that, in recent experiments, Stoddart and co-workers 37 have unequivocally shown that functionally rigid bistable molecular rotaxanes feature higher shuttling rates ( i.e. lower free energy barrier of activation up to 5 kcal mol −1 ) when compared to those observed in more flexible ones. Furthermore, as the same authors report, the increased structural rigidity in the dumb-bell backbone of rotaxanes not only favours the design of such devices limiting the number of accessible conformations via thermal fluctuations, but also provides relevant advantages during the fabrication of surface-based machinery avoiding, de facto , the back-folding events due to the presence of free recognition sites. The present results, although indirectly because of the different timescales, suggest that the presence of a rather flexible alkyl spacer in this thread might reduce the efficiency of the shuttling movement of this synthetic device. 13 In this view our results reinforce the idea that structural modifications able to make molecular spacers more rigid should efficiently increase the shuttling rate of mobile ring units backwards and forwards between the two functionalized end-moieties (for example in the present case succ and ni chemical groups).

From Soup: 28 As a conclusive remark, we would like to stress the fact that the reversible conformational shaping process observed in this case (see for example the Fig. 4 ) somewhat resembles that already observed in redox-controllable amphiphilic molecular rotaxanes in solution. 38 Indeed, experiments reported that in some flexible rotaxanes the electrochemical reduction was found to cause not only the shuttling of the tetracationic cyclophane, cyclobis(paraquat- p -phenylene) (CBPQT 4+ ) macrocycle , but also to activate the unfolding/folding conformational equilibrium in solution. In this respect, folded conformations exhibited a CBPQT 4+ group in interaction, through its two π-accepting bipyridinium units, with complementary π-donating moieties mainly located within the proposed aromatic stoppers at that time ( i.e. dendritic). 39

From Soup: 29 The characteristic UV-Vis absorption peak of the reduced ni moiety in the acetonitrile dilute solution and in electrostatic interaction with the bam ring has been calculated at TD-UDFT/C-PCM level of theory and our numerical results are summarized in Table 1 , where experimental assignments are also reported. For this purpose, as already reported in section 2.2 we have applied two different gradient-corrected density functionals: the hybrid PBE0 32 functionals, and the pure PW91 33 one. Looking at our data shown in Table 1 , it is interesting to note that, at TD-UPBE0/C-PCM level of theory, the maximum characteristic of the ni radical anion species in MeCN, having a λ max = 391 nm, falls at shorter wavelengths if compared with the experimental assignment at 415 nm. 13 On the other hand, the TD-UPW91/C-PCM computation proving a 2 π→π* excitation wavelength equal to 430 nm tends to overestimate the experimental data reported in the literature by Brouwer et al. 13 The same trend can be observed when the ni − / bam supramolecular couple is concerned. As a matter of fact, the experimental peak in the reduced rotaxane lying at 411 nm is predicted at λ max = 386 nm at the TD-UPBE0/C-PCM level of computation, and at λ max = 426 nm using the pure PW91 functional in conjunction with the C-PCM solvation model. It is noteworthy to mention that, even though the macrocycle surrounds the ni end-group, the absorption signals reported in Table 1 only involve (within a single electronic excitations approximation) frontier molecular orbitals with a full π conjugation localized over the cyclic imide which, in the investigated model, may be considered as the optical active unit in the range 400–430 nm (see the molecular orbitals depicted in Fig. 8 ). Furthermore, from spin density values extracted from the converged (ground state) electronic wavefunctions for the simulated complex in MeCN, it is rather clear that the naphthalimide station is a radical anion since the spin distribution on it is equal to 0.98 (at UPBE0/C-PCM level) and 0.97 (at UPW91/C-PCM level), respectively. This means that, in agreement with experimental findings in equilibrium conditions, 13 upon electrochemical reduction the excess negative charge is not present on the macrocycle group in the simulated complex which therefore remains in a neutral form also when the shuttling movement in solution (from succ to ni ) has been accomplished. This result seems to suggest that the mechanically interlocked benzylic amide macrocycle in the experimental scenario only acts as a sliding ring along the axle without providing any significant and undesired modification of the imposed electronic changes via external stimuli. At last, no spin contamination was observed in our calculations.

From Soup: 30 It should be pertinent to underline that, in the present investigation, we are not interested in reproducing exactly the absolute value of such a main band which may be viewed as systematically affected by the employed functional; rather, during our simulations we decided to choose as ‘observable’ the experimental excitation wavelength shift (from 415 nm to 411 nm, Δ λ max = 4 nm) which was originally proposed as a crucial variable for: (i) establishing the position of the macrocycle along the reduced succ –[C 12 alkyl spacer]– ni − thread; and (ii) obtaining information about the relaxation times accompanying the shuttling movement in different solvents of increased polarity. 13 In this respect, the data collected in Table 1 reveal that either the TD-UPBE0 or TD-UPW91 estimation of the absorption shift (termed as Δ λ max ) had success in reproducing the energy change observed in laboratory. In particular, the Δ λ max term calculated at TD-UPW91 perfectly agrees with the experiments, while the TD-UPBE0 value is seen to be a little bit overestimated (Δ λ max = 5.5 nm, see Table 1 ). The computed shifts are found to be in the right direction and, most importantly, qualitatively confirm the fact that the shorter excitation wavelength absorption of the naphthalimide radical anion is strictly linked to the formation of a cooperative electrostatic network composed by four [ bam -side]OCN–H–O CNR[ ni -side] hydrogen bonding interactions. 13 Always in this context, in a recent application dealing with such a synthetic thread in solution, 18 we estimated that when the local polarity of the environment in proximity of the naphthalimide chemical group is increased for the presence of an explicit [ succ -side]OCN–H–O CNR[ ni -side] noncovalent interaction, the excitation absorption wavelength at 415 nm undergoes a blue shift of 1.5 nm. It is therefore clear that the naphthalimide moiety in such a synthetic rotaxane working in solution can be considered as a sort of essential “residue” which provides both a site for the selective reduction triggering the electromechanical response, and a visible (violet) warning light through which obtaining information about the current status of the relative position of the ring while approaching to the ni moiety (see Fig. 8 ).

From Soup: 31 The two functionals employed in our investigation show a different intensity pattern with the hybrid PBE0 featuring higher oscillator strengths than those computed taking into account the PW91 one (see Table 1 ). We also note that they provide comparable oscillator strengths both in the presence and in the absence of the benzylic amide macrocycle . Unfortunately, the computed intensity at TD-UDFT level cannot be compared with available experimental data , because the electronic absorption spectra of electrochemically generated succ –[C 12 alkyl spacer]– ni − thread and the related rotaxane are always normalized in terms to the most intense absorption peak falling around 415/410 nm (see for example Fig. 3 reported in ref. 13 ). Finally, in our model systems in solution we replaced the (3,6) tert -butyl groups in the experimentally investigated naphthalimide with methyl groups only having first realized that such a substitution had shown a negligible effect on the strongest 2 π → π* electronic transition (the separation between the two absorption maxima remains confined within a single nanometre).

From Soup: 32 Summarizing, simulations dealing with a hydrogen-bonded molecular shuttle in a reduced form in its actual conditions— acetonitrile dilute solution, 298 K—are here reported. MD simulation is combined with TD-DFT/C-PCM computations in an attempt to computationally address the conformational shaping in solution of such a nanoscale machine, as well as a characteristic UV-Vis absorption signal used to detect the shuttling movements of a benzylic amide macrocycle mechanically trapped onto the succ –[C 12 alkyl spacer]– ni − thread. Our results provide both a computational point of view supporting experimental observations and some insights into the mechanical and electronic properties of the succ –[C 12 alkyl spacer]– ni − / bam system in solution. MD clearly evidences the crucial role played by noncovalent forces coupled with thermal effects in the investigated rotaxane which shows, at least within the range explored, a reversible folding/elongation-like conformational transition occurring in the flexible succ -–[C 12 alkyl spacer]– ni − thread in the reduced ensemble. As far as folded conformations are concerned, the benzylic amide macrocycle in its neutral form is seen to interact by means of electrostatic forces not only with the reduced naphthalimide station, but also with the succinamide end group. In agreement with experimental measurements, we observe that during the MD simulation the reduced molecular device shows a ring which lies completely towards the radical anion unit; this implies, as suggested by experiments, the presence of a peculiar electrostatic glue connecting the two molecular components ( i.e. bam and ni − ) in the supramolecular assembly through the formation of four OCN–H–O CNR hydrogen bonding contacts. It is worth noting that supramolecular interactions holding the succ and bam moieties at H-bond distance between them were not taken into account in the original experimental framework which mainly focussed the attention on the description of the shuttling movement along the thread. Quantum-chemical calculations carried out on a model compound embedded in a continuum and polarizable media suggest that supramolecular forces while keeping the bam and ni − molecular systems close to each other modulate the optical response of the chromophore making the shuttling movement visible as elegantly reported in the experiments.
