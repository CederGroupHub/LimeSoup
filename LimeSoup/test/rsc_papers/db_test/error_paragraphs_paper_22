From Soup: 0 The recent instability in the price of oil, and the perception (right or wrong) that oil reserves are in decline, means that the search for, and the commercialisation of, alternate technologies for the production of transportation fuels and chemicals is now a reality. The Fischer–Tropsch process for the conversion of synthesis gas to primarily hydrocarbons, but also oxygenates, is already practised in South Africa and Qatar and new large scale facilities are under construction in various parts of the world where large deposits of coal, gas or biomass are available for conversion to syngas mixtures.

From Soup: 1 The chemical composition of the mixtures obtained from these gas conversion processes are different to those obtained from oil and as a result the associated down stream refineries will be of a different configuration to the existing conventional units. This provides an opportunity to move away from established concepts and to design such installations from scratch using environmentally friendly technologies. In the review article published in this issue, Arno de Klerk lifts the lid on what is possible for the next generation of F-T refineries and essentially defines the future. 1 Make no mistake; many of us will be using this type of product in the years to come, so it is a debate well worth having.
