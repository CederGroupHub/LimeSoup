From cou.: 1 Processing of the standard addition data by using the net analyte signal (NAS) was introduced for analyte determination in the presence of matrix effects and spectral interference caused by unknown interferent(s). For solving matrix effects, standard addition was employed. By defining a vector which is the NAS for unit concentration of the analyte and correction of the analyte and the sample spectra for it, it was possible to obtain the spectrum of the unknown interferent(s). By using this method, a good estimate of the spectrum of the unknown interferent(s) was recovered. Both simulated and real data were employed to show the validity of the proposed method. Analysis of the simulated data by the proposed method showed that it is possible to resolve a good estimate of the spectrum of the unknown interferent(s) even in cases where the signal of the interferent(s) is up to 120% of the signal of the analyte with extreme overlapping of the spectra. In the next step, the resolved spectrum of the interferent(s) and the spectrum of the analyte were used to determine the analyte concentration by H-point standard addition. Real data were acquired from the standard addition of carvedilol to urine and standard addition of benzoate to a soft drink.

From cou.: 2 Spectrophotometric methodologies are good alternatives to separation techniques due to their lower cost and lower time of analysis and due to the generation of few waste products. However, one of the most serious problems that can occur in quantitative spectroscopic analysis is the presence of one or more spectral interferents (chemical species which affect the instrument response and those that have not been accounted for in the calibration process).

From cou.: 3 In first-order calibration methods, like PLS,1–5 spectral interferents in the unknown sample should be known and incorporated into calibration samples. In first-order instrumental data, unexpected constituents most probably constitute interference.6 The most commonly encountered problem using first-order calibration methods is matrix effects. Matrix effects are due to a change in the sensitivity coefficient between calibration and prediction.7

From cou.: 4 Chromatographic methods are standard separation methods for multicomponent determination in the presence of matrix effects, and known and unknown interferent(s). These official determination methods include mobile phases which contain significant amounts of organic solvents. Moreover, these methods are expensive and time-consuming. To overcome the complexity of the samples originating from matrix effects and known spectral interferent(s), standard addition strategies based on the H-point standard addition method (HPSAM)8–10 and net analyte signal (NAS)11 have been proposed. However, in the presence of the unknown interferent(s), such standard addition methods cannot be used and the HPSAM is limited to simple cases with a limited number of components. Alternative methods for the analysis under these conditions are multi-way chemometrics methods.

From cou.: 6 Now, multi-way analysis is a common method due to the availability of high-order instrumental data and the proliferation of chemometrics algorithms for data analysis.18 A particularly appealing property of multi-way data is the second-order advantage,19 a term coined to describe the analysis in the presence of unknown interferent(s). Acquiring multi-way data requires sophisticated instruments like HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS. Spectrofluorimeters and spectrophotometers can also give three-way data, for example by recording emission spectra in different excitation wavelengths, recording the spectra of a kinetic system with time or a titration system. However, most of these procedures are time-consuming. Therefore, simpler methods for solving matrix effects and analysis in the presence of unknown interferent(s) are required.

From cou.: 8 Since Lorber22 proposed the concept of the NAS, the NAS vector and its norm have been extensively employed in multivariate calibration. The NAS describes the part of a spectrum that the model relates it to the predicted quantity. Among the applications of the multivariate NAS, reporting an algorithm which has no need to select the number of latent variables in calibration,23 deriving a calibration vector for prediction in hybrid linear analysis (HLA),24 and related methods of HLA25–28 can be mentioned. The calculation of the NAS, as a preprocessing step, has been employed for classical least squares (CLS)29,30 and partial least squares (PLS).31 The calculation of the NAS was also used to quantify the extent of spectral overlap and to identify interfering components.32 A close review of the above methods derived from the NAS reveals that the method can improve the performance of first-order multivariate methods. Extending multivariate standard addition to univariate standard addition using the norm of NAS (NAS-SA)11,33 is another application of the NAS.

From cou.: 69 A
From Soup: 69 As stated by Ferre et al. , 38 the (multivariate) NAS vector is the part of the gross signal (of the mixture spectrum) that is useful for prediction. As can be inferred from eqn (3) , the second term ( H 0 = X T A ,− k ( X T A ,− k ) + ) contains contributions from all of the components except the analyte ( k th component). H 0 defines a space which is orthogonal to the space spanned by the NAS. Therefore, H defines the remaining space which characterizes the space for the added component (analyte). The vector r * A is the signal of the sample which has been corrected for the contribution of the interferent(s). It can be simply shown that r * A has relations with a (the spectrum of the analyte in the sample which may contain matrix effects) and i (the spectrum of the interferent(s)). Based on eqn (3) and (4) , we can write where x unknown is the spectrum of the sample without standard addition.

Calculated H 0 shows the space spanned by the constituents other than the added one (analyte) and H shows the remaining space. Now, projecting the analyte spectrum ( a ) onto the remaining space ( i.e. I − H 0 ) gives

From Soup: 83 In order to illustrate the ability of the proposed method in resolving the spectrum of the unknown interferent(s), three different standard addition data containing matrix effects and unknown interferent(s) were simulated. In these data, the spectrum of the analyte and unknown interferent(s) overlap with different extents. The spectra were simulated using the Gaussian functions. Five equal standard addition increments equivalent to 0.3 of the unit of the concentration were considered for the simulated data. A sample spectrum was calculated by the sum of the analyte spectrum multiplied by its concentration plus the interference spectrum. For obtaining matrix X , the added concentrations were multiplied by the analyte spectrum and the results were summed by the sample spectrum. Therefore, the resulting matrices in each case are of dimension (6 × number of channels). A homoscedastic noise equal to 5% was added to the all simulated standard addition data. The first spectrum in each case was considered as the sample spectrum. The sample spectrum is the sum of the spectrum of the analyte and the unknown interferent(s). The simulated spectra of the analyte and interferent(s) are shown in Fig. 2 .

From Soup: 84 In Fig. 2a and b , a single interferent is considered with a high overlap with the analyte but in Fig. 2b , the interferent has a broader band which extends to both the sides of the analyte band. In Fig. 2c , two interferents have been considered in two sides of the analyte band. In all of the simulated data, there is no selective region for the analyte. For each of the simulated samples shown in Fig. 2 , different intensities of the signal of the interferent(s) relative to the signal of the analyte at its maximum absorbance were considered ( i.e. 20, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 and 160%). The matrix effect was simulated by 10% change in the intensity of the signal of the analyte in the samples.

In these data, the spectrum of the analyte and unknown interferent(s) overlap with different extents. The spectra were simulated using the Gaussian functions. Five equal standard addition increments equivalent to 0.3 of the unit of the concentration were considered for the simulated data. A sample spectrum was calculated by the sum of the analyte spectrum multiplied by its concentration plus the interference spectrum. For obtaining matrix X, the added concentrations were multiplied by the analyte spectrum and the results were summed by the sample spectrum. Therefore, the resulting matrices in each case are of dimension (6 × number of channels). A homoscedastic noise equal to 5% was added to the all simulated standard addition data. The first spectrum in each case was considered as the sample spectrum. The sample spectrum is the sum of the spectrum of the analyte and the unknown interferent(s). The simulated spectra of the analyte and interferent(s) are shown in Fig. 2.
From Soup: 85 The standard addition data were analyzed by the proposed method. Firstly, the data were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) for finding the number of components. This number of components can be used in the calculation of the NAS. It must be mentioned that in all of the simulated standard addition data, the number of components is 2. Since standard addition was performed to the real sample containing analyte plus the interferent(s), the resulted matrix after standard additions contains a component with varying concentrations and a component with constant concentration (interferent(s)). Therefore, the rank of the standard addition matrix is always 2. This is true for all cases irrespective of the number of the interferents. All of the interferents act as a single component. The rank of a matrix is equal to the number of linearly independent rows or columns of the matrix. All of the rows of the matrix obtained by standard addition to the real sample can be obtained by linear combination of the spectrum of the analyte and cumulative spectrum of the interferents.
 ###### 
From cou.: 86 In Fig. 2a and b, a single interferent is considered with a high overlap with the analyte but in Fig. 2b, the interferent has a broader band which extends to both the sides of the analyte band. In Fig. 2c, two interferents have been considered in two sides of the analyte band. In all of the simulated data, there is no selective region for the analyte. For each of the simulated samples shown in Fig. 2, different intensities of the signal of the interferent(s) relative to the signal of the analyte at its maximum absorbance were considered (i.e. 20, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 and 160%). The matrix effect was simulated by 10% change in the intensity of the signal of the analyte in the samples.
From Soup: 86 In the next step, the data were analyzed for the calculation of the NAS with the specified number of components and subsequently, a spectrum for the interferent(s) in the simulated samples was calculated. For the simulated samples where the signal of the interferent(s) is 100% of the signal of the analyte at its maximum absorbance, the calculated spectrum of the interferent(s), s * and true interferent(s) spectrum are shown in Fig. 3 .
 ###### 
From cou.: 87 The standard addition data were analyzed by the proposed method. Firstly, the data were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) for finding the number of components. This number of components can be used in the calculation of the NAS. It must be mentioned that in all of the simulated standard addition data, the number of components is 2. Since standard addition was performed to the real sample containing analyte plus the interferent(s), the resulted matrix after standard additions contains a component with varying concentrations and a component with constant concentration (interferent(s)). Therefore, the rank of the standard addition matrix is always 2. This is true for all cases irrespective of the number of the interferents. All of the interferents act as a single component. The rank of a matrix is equal to the number of linearly independent rows or columns of the matrix. All of the rows of the matrix obtained by standard addition to the real sample can be obtained by linear combination of the spectrum of the analyte and cumulative spectrum of the interferents.
From Soup: 87 For evaluating the resolved spectrum of the interferent(s) in each sample, a correlation between the true spectrum and calculated one was obtained. In the next step, by using the resolved spectrum of the interferent(s) and mean spectrum of the analyte in each case, wavelength pairs with equal signals for the interferent(s) and different signals for the analyte were selected for application of the H-point standard addition method. The mean spectrum of the analyte which contains the matrix effects was obtained by subtraction of the sample spectrum from the standard addition spectra and averaging the results. For the samples with spectra shown in Fig. 2 , the results are collected in Table 1 . It must be mentioned that the concentrations obtained for the analyte are the mean of the results of several wavelength pairs. The specificity of the method was also evaluated and the results are included in Table 1 . The principle of specificity measurements consists of examining the regression line between the true interferent(s) spectrum and the estimated interferent(s) spectrum and verifying that the slope is equal to 1 ( t obs < t crit ) and that the intercept point is equal to 0 ( t ′ obs < t crit ). The hypotheses are tested using a t -test associated with a 95% confidence level. The value of t crit at the 95% confidence level for degree of freedom equal to ∞ (number of wavelengths is 250) is 1.96. As can be seen, in all cases, calculated t obs and t ′ obs values are smaller than the critical value. This indicates that the estimated spectra for the interferent(s) do not differ from the true ones significantly.
 ###### 
From cou.: 88 In the next step, the data were analyzed for the calculation of the NAS with the specified number of components and subsequently, a spectrum for the interferent(s) in the simulated samples was calculated. For the simulated samples where the signal of the interferent(s) is 100% of the signal of the analyte at its maximum absorbance, the calculated spectrum of the interferent(s), s* and true interferent(s) spectrum are shown in Fig. 3.
From Soup: 88 From the results collected in Table 1 , it can be concluded that: (1) overall, with increasing the intensity of the signal of the interferent(s), the correlation between the true spectrum of the interferent(s) and the resolved one decreases, (2) as is expected, by increasing the overlap of the signal of the analyte with the signal of interferent(s), the correlation between the true spectrum of the interferent(s) and the resolved one decreases, (3) when the signal of the interferent(s) increases up to 120% of the signal of the analyte, the percent relative errors in prediction of the concentration of the analyte becomes more than 10% and (4) in the cases where the intensity of the signal of the interferent(s) is low (20% in Table 1 ), the correlation between the true spectrum of the interferent(s) and the resolved one is poor. The conclusion (4) can be explained as follows. Because of the addition of noise to the simulated data and remembering this point that the NAS is the part of the signal which is orthogonal to the signal of the analyte, the noise is collected in the resolved spectrum of the interferent(s). On the other hand, since the intensity of the signal of the interferent(s) is low in these cases (cases where the intensity of the signal of the interferent(s) is 20% of the signal of the analyte), though the overall shape of the resolved spectrum is very similar to the true spectrum of the interferent(s), the correlation is poor. Fig. 4 shows the resolved spectra of the interferent(s) in three different simulated data where the intensity of the signal of the interferent(s) is 20% of the signal of the analyte at its maximum absorbance.

From cou.: 89 For evaluating the resolved spectrum of the interferent(s) in each sample, a correlation between the true spectrum and calculated one was obtained. In the next step, by using the resolved spectrum of the interferent(s) and mean spectrum of the analyte in each case, wavelength pairs with equal signals for the interferent(s) and different signals for the analyte were selected for application of the H-point standard addition method.

The specificity of the method was also evaluated and the results are included in Table 1. The principle of specificity measurements consists of examining the regression line between the true interferent(s) spectrum and the estimated interferent(s) spectrum and verifying that the slope is equal to 1 (tobs < tcrit) and that the intercept point is equal to 0 (t′obs < tcrit). The hypotheses are tested using a t-test associated with a 95% confidence level. The value of tcrit at the 95% confidence level for degree of freedom equal to ∞ (number of wavelengths is 250) is 1.96. As can be seen, in all cases, calculated tobs and t′obs values are smaller than the critical value. This indicates that the estimated spectra for the interferent(s) do not differ from the true ones significantly.
From Soup: 89 The chemical matrix effect can be detected by comparing the slope of the calibration curve corresponding to pure standards with the slope of the calibration curve corresponding to standard addition to the urine sample. When both slopes are significantly different, the existence of matrix effects is confirmed. Therefore, separately, the fluorescence intensity was plotted for pure standards and standard addition samples at maximum of the emission spectra of CAR (350 nm) with excitation at 246 nm. The slopes of the plots were 1121.2 and 1802.8 for pure standards and standard addition to the urine sample, respectively. The slope of the standard addition curve is 60.8% different from the slope in pure standards. Therefore, the matrix effect exists in the determination of CAR in urine and standard addition can be employed for solving it.

From cou.: 90 From the results collected in Table 1, it can be concluded that: (1) overall, with increasing the intensity of the signal of the interferent(s), the correlation between the true spectrum of the interferent(s) and the resolved one decreases, (2) as is expected, by increasing the overlap of the signal of the analyte with the signal of interferent(s), the correlation between the true spectrum of the interferent(s) and the resolved one decreases, (3) when the signal of the interferent(s) increases up to 120% of the signal of the analyte, the percent relative errors in prediction of the concentration of the analyte becomes more than 10% and (4) in the cases where the intensity of the signal of the interferent(s) is low (20% in Table 1), the correlation between the true spectrum of the interferent(s) and the resolved one is poor.

Fig. 4 shows the resolved spectra of the interferent(s) in three different simulated data where the intensity of the signal of the interferent(s) is 20% of the signal of the analyte at its maximum absorbance.
From Soup: 90 In order to show the presence of spectral interferent(s) in the urine sample, the standard addition curve at an emission wavelength of 350 nm was constructed and the concentration of CAR was predicted. The obtained concentration was 0.203 mg L −1 instead of 0.150 mg L −1 . This result clearly shows the existence of bias resulted from spectral interferents. Comparison of the shape of the emission spectrum of the pure analyte and its emission spectrum in the urine sample can also be useful for the identification of the spectral interferents ( Fig. 5 ). Comparison of the sample spectrum with the spectrum of the analyte (CAR) shows that spectral interferences from unknown species exist in urine. Therefore, we chose to perform standard addition. Spectra obtained by standard addition of CAR to the urine sample are shown in Fig. 6 . Because of the existence of signals from unknown species, we processed standard addition data by using the NAS for extracting the signal of the interferent(s). In fact, this was an examination of the NAS for extracting signal of unknown interferent(s).

The slope of the standard addition curve is 60.8% different from the slope in pure standards. Therefore, the matrix effect exists in the determination of CAR in urine and standard addition can be employed for solving it.
From Soup: 91 The standard addition data to the urine sample were analyzed for the number of components by PCA. Fig. 7 shows the variation of the logarithm of the eigen values with the number of components. Clearly, based on Fig. 7 , two components can be identified in the standard addition data.
 ###### 
From cou.: 92 In order to show the presence of spectral interferent(s) in the urine sample, the standard addition curve at an emission wavelength of 350 nm was constructed and the concentration of CAR was predicted. The obtained concentration was 0.203 mg L−1 instead of 0.150 mg L−1. This result clearly shows the existence of bias resulted from spectral interferents. Comparison of the shape of the emission spectrum of the pure analyte and its emission spectrum in the urine sample can also be useful for the identification of the spectral interferents (Fig. 5). Comparison of the sample spectrum with the spectrum of the analyte (CAR) shows that spectral interferences from unknown species exist in urine. Therefore, we chose to perform standard addition. Spectra obtained by standard addition of CAR to the urine sample are shown in Fig. 6. Because of the existence of signals from unknown species, we processed standard addition data by using the NAS for extracting the signal of the interferent(s). In fact, this was an examination of the NAS for extracting signal of unknown interferent(s).
From Soup: 92 The mean spectrum of the analyte (CAR) was calculated by subtraction of the standard addition spectra from the sample spectrum and averaging them. In the next step, the NAS was extracted for the standard addition data with two components. The calculated spectrum of the CAR, the NAS for the unit variation in the concentration of the CAR ( s *) and calculated spectrum of the unknown interferent(s) in the urine sample are shown in Fig. 8 . As can be seen from Fig. 8 , the interferent(s) have a broad emission spectrum which extends to the both sides of the spectrum of CAR. It is clear that without separation, obtaining the concentration of CAR in urine is not possible. Alternatively, the second-order data should be acquired and analyzed by the second-order algorithms.
 ###### 
From cou.: 93 The standard addition data to the urine sample were analyzed for the number of components by PCA. Fig. 7 shows the variation of the logarithm of the eigen values with the number of components. Clearly, based on Fig. 7, two components can be identified in the standard addition data.
From Soup: 93 Now, the spectra of the analyte and interferent(s) are available, the H-point standard addition method can be employed to obtain the concentration of CAR in the urine sample. A typical H-point standard addition plot is shown in Fig. 9 . The results for H-point standard addition in different wavelength pairs are collected in Table 2 . Based on the NAS calculations, 40 parameters like selectivity (SEL), limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were also calculated and are included in Table 2 . Moreover, for examining the presence of bias in the results of the proposed method, t statistics was calculated and is reported in Table 2 . As can be seen, the calculated t value is lower than the critical one at the 95% confidence level with corresponding degrees of freedom.
 ###### 
From cou.: 94 The mean spectrum of the analyte (CAR) was calculated by subtraction of the standard addition spectra from the sample spectrum and averaging them. In the next step, the NAS was extracted for the standard addition data with two components. The calculated spectrum of the CAR, the NAS for the unit variation in the concentration of the CAR (s*) and calculated spectrum of the unknown interferent(s) in the urine sample are shown in Fig. 8.

It is clear that without separation, obtaining the concentration of CAR in urine is not possible. Alternatively, the second-order data should be acquired and analyzed by the second-order algorithms.
From Soup: 94 For the evaluation of the method in the calculation of the spectrum of the interferent(s), the predicted concentration of CAR in urine can be compared with the spiked concentration (0.150 mg L −1 ). In most cases, the percent relative errors are low. The mean of the predicted concentrations in different wavelength pairs is 0.150 mg L −1 . The results confirm that the method can truly resolve the spectrum of the unknown interferent(s).
 ###### 
From cou.: 95 Now, the spectra of the analyte and interferent(s) are available, the H-point standard addition method can be employed to obtain the concentration of CAR in the urine sample. A typical H-point standard addition plot is shown in Fig. 9. The results for H-point standard addition in different wavelength pairs are collected in Table 2.

As can be seen, the calculated t value is lower than the critical one at the 95% confidence level with corresponding degrees of freedom.
From Soup: 95 As another real sample, we chose to analyse a marketed soft drink. The absorbing compounds in the soft drink are two dyes (sunset yellow and azorubine), other absorbing ingredients and sodium benzoate as a preservative. Dyes have broad absorption bands which severely overlap with the UV-Vis spectrum of sodium benzoate. For evaluating matrix effects, slopes of the standard addition line and calibration with pure standards of sodium benzoate at 228 nm were compared. The slopes were 0.0634 and 0.0582, respectively. As can be seen, a weak matrix effect can be detected in this sample.

From cou.: 96 For the evaluation of the method in the calculation of the spectrum of the interferent(s), the predicted concentration of CAR in urine can be compared with the spiked concentration (0.150 mg L−1).

The results confirm that the method can truly resolve the spectrum of the unknown interferent(s).
From Soup: 96 Spectra of the standard addition to the 10 fold diluted soft drink sample can be seen in Fig. 10 . The data were analyzed by the proposed method. Different spectra calculated based on the NAS are shown in Fig. 11 . Based on the spectrum of the analyte and the resolved spectrum of the unknown interferent(s), wavelength pairs were selected and used for the calculation of the concentration of sodium benzoate by the H-point standard addition method. A typical H-point standard addition plot is shown in Fig. 12 . The results of H-point standard addition are reported in Table 3 . As can be seen from Table 3 , the percent relative errors in the prediction of the concentration of sodium benzoate in soft drink are below 5%. This indicates that the spectrum of the unknown interferent(s) has been calculated, correctly. Parameters calculated based on the NAS are included in Table 3 . Calculated t statistics reported in Table 3 indicate that the method is free from the bias (calculated t value is lower than the critical one at the 95% confidence level with corresponding degrees of freedom).

From Soup: 97 In this case, a limited number of wavelength pairs were found which fulfill the conditions of the H-point standard addition method. This was because of the special position of the spectra of the analyte and unknown interferent(s).

From Soup: 98 Owing to the complexity of the real samples that in many cases originates from spectral interferent(s) and matrix effects, special strategies must be used for the analysis. It was demonstrated that by using the concept of the NAS, it is possible to resolve the spectrum of the unknown interferent(s). The method proposed was shown to be very suitable for determination in complex samples like urine where both matrix effects and unknown spectral interferent(s) exist. In the analysis of such samples, separation techniques such as HPLC should be used.

From cou.: 99 In this case, a limited number of wavelength pairs were found which fulfill the conditions of the H-point standard addition method. This was because of the special position of the spectra of the analyte and unknown interferent(s).
From Soup: 99 Unlike the other methods for the determination of the analyte in the presence of matrix effects and spectral interferent(s) like the HPSAM, the proposed method can be applied to analysis of the mixtures with any number of components because the method can resolve an accumulative spectrum of the unknown interferent(s). In contrast to the NAS-SA, in the proposed method, it is not necessary to know the spectrum of the interferent(s) beforehand. The proposed method can also be used for the calculation of a good estimate of the spectrum of interferent(s) for methods such as MCR-ALS.
