From cou.: 1 Herein, the spin-forbidden cooling of a gallium hydride molecule is investigated using ab initio quantum chemistry. The cooling transition and the corresponding potential energy curves including , a3Π0−, a3Π0+, a3Π1, a3Π2, A1Π1, , 13Σ+1, , , and 23Σ+1 states are simulated based on the multi-reference configuration interaction approach plus Davidson corrections method. By solving the nuclear Schrödinger equation, we calculate the spectroscopic constants of these states, which are in good agreement with the available experimental values. Based on the transition data, there seems to be a theoretical puzzle: highly diagonally distributed Franck–Condon factor f00 for transitions , , and for the gallium hydride molecule but the intervening state A1Π1 for transition is prohibitive to laser cooling. In addition, the transition does not have a suitable rate of optical cycling owing to a large radiative lifetime for state. Our theoretical simulation indicates the solution to the puzzle: the transition has a high emission rate, and there is a suitable radiative lifetime for a3Π1 state, which can ensure rapid and efficient laser cooling of gallium hydride. The proposed laser drives transition by using three wavelengths (main pump laser λ00; two repumping lasers λ10 and λ21). These results demonstrate the possibility of laser-cooling the gallium hydride molecule, and a sub-microkelvin cool temperature can be reached for this molecule.

From cou.: 2 Ultracold molecules have significant potential for their application in quantum systems,1 precision measurement,2,3 chemical dynamics,4 controlled chemistry,5etc. Thus, the investigation and development of new potential cooling candidates are drawing increasing attention in the field of research. Yet, direct cooling of molecules to the ultracold regime is much more difficult than that of atoms because of the complexity of the energy level structure.6 However, surprisingly enough, direct laser cooling of SrF molecules was reported by Shuman et al. in 2010.7 Ever since then, laser cooling of diatomic molecules has aroused wide interest from an increasing number of investigators with some scientific results published. Experimentally, one- and two-dimensional transverse laser cooling of YO molecule was demonstrated by Hummon et al.,8 and longitudinal cooling of CaF was achieved by Zhelyazkova via the counter-propagating laser light resonant with an almost-closed vibrational transition.9 Then, Lien et al. cooled an AlH+ molecular ion to the ground rovibrational state using a broadband laser.10 Based on these experiments, one can summarize the criteria of a candidate molecule suitable for laser cooling: high Franck–Condon factor (FCF) and appropriate upper states. The FCF describes the degree of overlap for vibrational wave functions of two electronic states. In practice, highly diagonal FCFs can lower the requirement for laser beams that keep the molecule in a semiclassical closed-loop cooling cycle. The upper states can radiate and close the cycling transition; that is, the intervening electronic states have no impact on the laser cooling cycle.

From cou.: 3 In recent years, laser cooling of diatomic molecules has attracted much theoretical research interest. The feasibility of laser cooling of alkaline-earth-metal hydrides and halides (such as BeH, MgH, BeF, MgF, and BeCl) has been researched using the ab initio quantum chemistry method.11–15 Bian et al. investigated the laser cooling of CaCl and production of ultracold chlorine atoms.16 These candidate molecules have highly diagonal FCFs, short radiative lifetimes, and the existence of no intermediate electronic state between A2Π and X2Σ. Yet, when an intervening state exists, it is necessary to ensure a closed laser cooling cycle transition from the upper state to the ground state. Nguyen and Odom studied the laser cooling of a SiO+ cation for the B2Σ+ → X2Σ+ cycle transition, where population accumulation in the intervening state A2Σ was prevented by its short lifetime.17 In 2015, laser cooling of a LiBe molecule based on 22Σ+ → 12Σ+ transition was applied by You et al., and the intervening state 12Π was not prohibitive to the cooling cycle because of the small diagonal FCFs of transitions 12Π → 12Σ+ and 22Σ+ → 12Π.18 In the same year, Yang et al. studied the laser cooling of a ScO molecule, an found the existence of an intervening A′2Δ state between A2Π and X2Σ+. In addition, Wan et al. demonstrated that an AlCl molecule is a very appropriate candidate for laser cooling. They found that the intervening state has almost no influence on the main cycling.19 Even more intriguing, the a3Π → X1Σ+ spin-forbidden cooling transition of AlF has also been theoretically suggested to attain a very low final temperature.20 Afterward, the feasibility of the laser cooling project for BBr/BCl21 and LiRb22 was researched using spin-forbidden transition. Kobayashi et al. also experimentally confirmed that the spin-forbidden transition B3Π → X1Σ+ is well suited for implementing narrow-line laser cooling of a KRb molecule, which opens the door to find similar molecules that can be laser-cooled.23

From cou.: 4 Di Rosa identified BH and AlH as candidate molecules for laser cooling.24 Hendricks et al. also found that a BH molecule is a good choice for laser cooling on A1Π → X1Σ+ transition by measuring the branching ratios, and the measurement results showed that the spin-forbidden transition to the intermediate a3Π state is strongly suppressed.25 The feasibility of laser cooling of BH26 and AlH20 molecules was studied using multi-reference configuration interaction, and strong diagonal factors were obtained for A1Π → X1Σ+ and a3Π → X1Σ+. However, they thought that transition A1Π → X1Σ+ is more promising than a3Π → X1Σ+ for laser cooling, because the spin-forbidden transition is very weak. This is why the possibility of laser cooling on a3Π → X1Σ+ transition has not yet been investigated. A GaH molecule has electronic structure similar to that of BH and AlH.

From cou.: 7 All calculations are performed in the C2v point group symmetry, which has four irreducible representations (a1, b1, b2, a2). a1 yields Σ+ states and a component of Δ states, b1 and b2 provide the Π states, and a2 yields Σ− states and the other component of Δ states. In the CASSCF calculations, nine molecular orbitals (MOs) are chosen as the active space (7σ8σ9σ4πx4πy10σ11σ5πx5πy) of GaH, including H 1s1, Ga 4s24p15s5p shells, i.e., four electrons are distributed in a (5220) active space. In following MRCI step, Ga 3d10 shell is used for core–valence correlation for GaH. That is, 14 electrons are used in the correlation energy calculations. In all electronic structure calculations for the Ω states, the augmented correlation-consistent polarized valence quintuple zeta (aug-cc-pV5Z) basis set is used for the H atom, and the primary and contracted atomic basis set is (8s4p3d2f1g)/(5s4p3d2f1g).48 However, because the core–valence correlation of gallium is essential for accurate calculations, the large augmented consistent polarized core–valence correlation quintuple zeta (aug-cc-pCV5Z) basis set is chosen for the Ga atom.49 The primary and contracted atomic basis set is (8s7p5d3f2g1h)/(4s4d4f3g2h1i).49 In addition, the SOC effects are evaluated by one- and two-electron Breit–Pauli operators.50

From Soup: 20 The PECs and spectroscopic constants of the recommended molecules must be accurately computed to determine their suitability for laser cooling. As a consequence, X 1 Σ + , a 3 Π, A 1 Π, 1 3 Σ + , 2 1 Σ + , and 2 3 Σ + states of the GaH molecule with the lowest two dissociation channels Ga( 2 P u ) + H( 2 S g ) and Ga( 2 S g ) + H( 2 S g ) are investigated at the MRCI+Q level in the present study. Concerning the effects of SOC on the electronic structure of the GaH molecule, 3 Π and 3 Σ + states split into four and two Ω states, respectively. In addition, because GaH is a heavy nuclear molecule, the SOC effects are considered in calculations. The dissociation channel Ga( 2 P u ) + H( 2 S g ) splits into two asymptotes, namely Ga( 2 P 1/2 ) + H( 2 S 1/2 ) and Ga( 2 P 3/2 ) + H( 2 S 1/2 ). The PECs for , a 3 Π 0 − , a 3 Π 0 + , a 3 Π 1 , a 3 Π 2 , A 1 Π 1 , , 1 3 Σ + 1 , , , and 2 3 Σ + 1 states are plotted in Fig. 1 . As can be seen in this figure, 11 Ω electronic states correlate with three dissociation channels for the GaH molecule. In order to show the relationship of electronic states and dissociation channels more clearly, an extended diagram is presented in Fig. 2 . , a 3 Π 0 − , and a 3 Π 1 states dissociate into the lowest channel Ga( 2 P 1/2 ) + H( 2 S 1/2 ). a 3 Π 0 + , a 3 Π 2 , A 1 Π 1 , , and 1 3 Σ + 1 states dissociate into Ga( 2 P 3/2 ) + H( 2 S 1/2 ). , , and 2 3 Σ + 1 states dissociate into the highest channel Ga( 2 S 1/2 ) + H( 2 S 1/2 ). The relationships between the dissociation limits and the Ω states of GaH are listed in Table 1 . The computed atomic energy differences are 823.74 cm −1 ( 2 P 3/2 + 2 S 1/2 ) and 24712.25 cm −1 ( 2 S 1/2 + 2 S 1/2 ), respectively, which well reproduce the experimental values 56 of 826.19 and 24788.53 cm −1 . Table 2 lists the spectroscopic constants from our study, together with previous theoretical calculations 39 and available experimental values 33 for comparison. In order to analyze the influence level of scalar relativistic corrections on the results, the spectral constants of , a 3 Π 0 − , a 3 Π 0 + , a 3 Π 1 , and a 3 Π 2 states are also calculated under no scalar relativistic corrections. As shown in Table 2 , the vibrational frequencies of , a 3 Π 0 + , and a 3 Π 1 states are obtained as 1564.47, 1700.93, and 1698.84 cm −1 by using the MRCI method, and 1591.63, 1649.50, and 1646.20 cm −1 by using the MRCI + DKH method, respectively. Obviously, the results from the MRCI + DKH method are in excellent agreement with the experimental values 33 of 1604.52, 1640.54, and 1631.17 cm −1 , respectively. Therefore, the data based on scalar relativistic corrections will be analyzed in the following sections.

From cou.: 21 The permanent dipole moments (PDMs) and TDMs are obtained by the MRCI+Q method. All PECs are calculated with an interval of 0.005 nm over the distance of 0.09–0.9 nm. To achieve accurate results, the interval value is reduced to 0.002 nm near the equilibrium bond distance. The vibrational energy levels and spectroscopic constants (Re, ωe, ωeχe, Be, De, Te) are evaluated by solving the nuclear Schrödinger equation using the LEVEL8.2 program.53 The radiative lifetimes and FCFs of various vibrational levels are also determined from the LEVEL8.2 program with the PECs and TDMs of different electronic states.
From Soup: 21 As for the state, the equilibrium bond distance R e and vibrational frequency ω e are calculated to be 1.6736 Å and 1591.63 cm −1 , and the corresponding differences are only 0.0106 Å and 12.89 cm −1 with respect to the experiment values, respectively. The values of ω e χ e = 28.462 cm −1 and B e = 6.0953 cm −1 are also in good accordance with the experimental data of 28.77 cm −1 and 6.137 cm −1 . In addition, accurate values of R e and ω e were obtained by Yang et al. using the ab initio method. 39 The well depth was 2.9205 eV for the ground state, which is in excellent agreement with the previous theoretical D e value of 2.89 eV. 39 Our equilibrium distance R e for the a 3 Π 0 − , a 3 Π 0 + , and a 3 Π 1 states is 1.6106, 1.6102, and 1.6108 Å, which differs from the experimental values 33 of 0.0232, 0.0190, and 0.0183 Å, respectively. The same good agreement of ω e , ω e χ e , and B e for the a 3 Π 0 + and a 3 Π 1 states between our results and the experimental results is found. For example, the calculated ω e for the abovementioned two states is 1649.50 and 1646.20 cm −1 , while the experimental values 32 are 1640.54 and 1631.17 cm −1 , respectively, this giving percentage errors of only 0.55% and 0.92%. Obviously, our values of ω e for a 3 Π 0 + and a 3 Π 1 states are much closer to the experimental data 33 than the previous theoretical values 39 (1804.57 and 1821.64 cm −1 ) reported by Yang et al. One of the reasons is the larger active space we use in this calculation. The spectroscopic constants for a 3 Π 2 state are also predicted: R e = 1.6110 Å, ω e = 1693.80 cm −1 , ω e χ e = 87.199 cm −1 , B e = 6.5543 cm −1 , D e = 0.86791 eV, and T e = 17258.80 cm −1 . Table 2 shows that our results of D e and T e agree with those of previous theoretical data 39 for a 3 Π 0 − , a 3 Π 0 + , a 3 Π 1 , and a 3 Π 2 states. For example, the differences in the dissociation energy D e for the four states are only 0.00439, 0.00928, 0.00345, and 0.08791 eV, respectively. Note that the calculated T e for a 3 Π 0 − , a 3 Π 0 + , and a 3 Π 1 are 16745.00, 16752.13, and 16994.60 cm −1 , which match well with the experimental values of 17333, 17337.08, and 17622.01 cm −1 reported by Huber and Herzberg. 33

In addition, because GaH is a heavy nuclear molecule, the SOC effects are considered in calculations. The dissociation channel Ga(2Pu) + H(2Sg) splits into two asymptotes, namely Ga(2P1/2) + H(2S1/2) and Ga(2P3/2) + H(2S1/2). The PECs for , a3Π0−, a3Π0+, a3Π1, a3Π2, A1Π1, , 13Σ+1, , , and 23Σ+1 states are plotted in Fig. 1. As can be seen in this figure, 11 Ω electronic states correlate with three dissociation channels for the GaH molecule. In order to show the relationship of electronic states and dissociation channels more clearly, an extended diagram is presented in Fig. 2. , a3Π0−, and a3Π1 states dissociate into the lowest channel Ga(2P1/2) + H(2S1/2). a3Π0+, a3Π2, A1Π1, , and 13Σ+1 states dissociate into Ga(2P3/2) + H(2S1/2). , , and 23Σ+1 states dissociate into the highest channel Ga(2S1/2) + H(2S1/2). The relationships between the dissociation limits and the Ω states of GaH are listed in Table 1. The computed atomic energy differences are 823.74 cm−1 (2P3/2 + 2S1/2) and 24712.25 cm−1 (2S1/2 + 2S1/2), respectively, which well reproduce the experimental values56 of 826.19 and 24788.53 cm−1. Table 2 lists the spectroscopic constants from our study, together with previous theoretical calculations39 and available experimental values33 for comparison. In order to analyze the influence level of scalar relativistic corrections on the results, the spectral constants of , a3Π0−, a3Π0+, a3Π1, and a3Π2 states are also calculated under no scalar relativistic corrections. As shown in Table 2, the vibrational frequencies of , a3Π0+, and a3Π1 states are obtained as 1564.47, 1700.93, and 1698.84 cm−1 by using the MRCI method, and 1591.63, 1649.50, and 1646.20 cm−1 by using the MRCI + DKH method, respectively. Obviously, the results from the MRCI + DKH method are in excellent agreement with the experimental values33 of 1604.52, 1640.54, and 1631.17 cm−1, respectively. Therefore, the data based on scalar relativistic corrections will be analyzed in the following sections.
From Soup: 22 As seen in Fig. 1 , and 1 3 Σ + 1 are repulsive states. In a previous theoretical study by Yang et al. , 39 A 1 Π 1 had only a shallow potential well. However, our simulation shows that the state has two potential wells, which are plotted in Fig. 3 . The first well is located at 23951.59 cm −1 above the ground state, at a depth of 0.033607 eV, and the second well is located at 24102.86 cm −1 above the ground state, at a depth of 0.012963 eV. The equilibrium bond distances and vibrational frequencies for the two potential wells are also obtained: R e (first well) = 1.7391 Å, ω e (first well) = 861.24 cm −1 , R e (second well) = 3.3196 Å, and ω e (second well) = 99.728 cm −1 . Yet, ω e χ e cannot be obtained for the two shallow potential wells in A 1 Π 1 state with only one vibrational level. Similar to A 1 Π 1 state, state has two potential wells; the corresponding spectroscopic constants are listed in Table 2 . The difference is that the second well of state is wide and deep. Moreover, the spin–orbit coupling effect has a weak influence on 2 3 Σ + state. Note that no experimental data exist for A 1 Π 1 , , , and 2 3 Σ + 1 states, which are studied for the first time. The properties of the abovementioned electronic states are calculated for developing an applicable cooling transition of gallium hydride.
 ###### 
From cou.: 23 As for the state, the equilibrium bond distance Re and vibrational frequency ωe are calculated to be 1.6736 Å and 1591.63 cm−1, and the corresponding differences are only 0.0106 Å and 12.89 cm−1 with respect to the experiment values, respectively. The values of ωeχe = 28.462 cm−1 and Be = 6.0953 cm−1 are also in good accordance with the experimental data of 28.77 cm−1 and 6.137 cm−1. In addition, accurate values of Re and ωe were obtained by Yang et al. using the ab initio method.39 The well depth was 2.9205 eV for the ground state, which is in excellent agreement with the previous theoretical De value of 2.89 eV.39 Our equilibrium distance Re for the a3Π0−, a3Π0+, and a3Π1 states is 1.6106, 1.6102, and 1.6108 Å, which differs from the experimental values33 of 0.0232, 0.0190, and 0.0183 Å, respectively. The same good agreement of ωe, ωeχe, and Be for the a3Π0+ and a3Π1 states between our results and the experimental results is found. For example, the calculated ωe for the abovementioned two states is 1649.50 and 1646.20 cm−1, while the experimental values32 are 1640.54 and 1631.17 cm−1, respectively, this giving percentage errors of only 0.55% and 0.92%. Obviously, our values of ωe for a3Π0+ and a3Π1 states are much closer to the experimental data33 than the previous theoretical values39 (1804.57 and 1821.64 cm−1) reported by Yang et al. One of the reasons is the larger active space we use in this calculation. The spectroscopic constants for a3Π2 state are also predicted: Re = 1.6110 Å, ωe = 1693.80 cm−1, ωeχe = 87.199 cm−1, Be = 6.5543 cm−1, De = 0.86791 eV, and Te = 17258.80 cm−1. Table 2 shows that our results of De and Te agree with those of previous theoretical data39 for a3Π0−, a3Π0+, a3Π1, and a3Π2 states. For example, the differences in the dissociation energy De for the four states are only 0.00439, 0.00928, 0.00345, and 0.08791 eV, respectively. Note that the calculated Te for a3Π0−, a3Π0+, and a3Π1 are 16745.00, 16752.13, and 16994.60 cm−1, which match well with the experimental values of 17333, 17337.08, and 17622.01 cm−1 reported by Huber and Herzberg.33
From Soup: 23 GaH molecule has electronic structure similar to that of BH 26 and AlH. 20 The laser cooling of BH and AlH molecules based on spin-allowed transition (A 1 Π → X 1 Σ + ) has been applied, so the property for spin-allowed transition of GaH molecule will be analyzed in this section. As seen in Fig. 1 , the spin-allowed transitions , , and are possible for the GaH molecule according to the computation results. PDMs for , A 1 Π 1 , and states and TDMs for , , and transitions as a function of internuclear distance at the MRCI+Q level of the GaH molecule are plotted in Fig. 4 and 5 , respectively. PDMs for , A 1 Π 1 , and states at R e are 0.13846, 0.00799, and 0.66126 a.u., respectively. The PDM function of ground state shows a linear behavior up to approximately 3.00 Å, the values of PDMs reach the maximum of about 1.6423 a.u., and then drop to zero at approximately 7.00 Å for this state. There are maximum and minimum of PDMs for A 1 Π 1 state at 1.36 Å and 2.32 Å, respectively. PDMs for state have a minimum of −0.41347 a.u. at 2.24 Å and maximum of 8.2837 a.u. at 5.95 Å. Nevertheless, there is still a local maximum 2.2671 a.u. of PDMs for state at 0.95 Å. This is because A 1 Π 1 and states have two potential wells. In addition, it is clear that the maximum of PDMs for state is much larger than the others, which is because the second well for state is wide and deep.

The maximum value of TDMs for these three transitions is less than 3.00 a.u., and the transition strength for transition is the smallest. TDM for approaches zero at large distances owing to orbit-forbidden transitions at the atomic limits from Ga( 2 P 1/2 ) to Ga( 2 P 3/2 ). However, TDMs for and transitions approach 0.77 a.u. at large distances because of orbit-allowed transitions at the atomic limits from Ga( 2 P 1/2,3/2 ) to Ga( 2 S 1/2 ). In addition, the diagonal FCFs f 00 = 0.7439 for transition and f 00 = 0.9600 for transition are obtained. Obviously, the FCF for transition of the GaH molecule is sufficiently large for laser cooling. However, the intervening state A 1 Π 1 is prohibitive to the cooling cycle because of the large diagonal FCF f 00 = 0.8749 and emission rate A 00 = 5.7587 × 10 7 of the transition . Therefore, it is not possible to cool the GaH molecule based on spin-allowed transition.

From Soup: 25 The TDM of a 3 Π → X 1 Σ + transition is zero without spin–orbit coupling because this transition is spin-forbidden. However, the transition can occur in the splitting states with spin–orbit coupling. According to the transition selection rule, J ′′ = 0 − ↔ J ′ = 0 + and J ′′ = 0 + ↔ J ′ = 2 transitions are not allowed, that is, and transitions are forbidden. and transitions are calculated in the present study, and TDMs of these two transitions and PDMs of , a 3 Π 0 + , and a 3 Π 1 states as a function of the internuclear distance R are plotted in Fig. 6 and 7 , respectively. Fig. 6 shows that the maximum for PDMs of state is much larger than a 3 Π 0 + and a 3 Π 1 , because the potential well of ground state is the deepest. The PDM function for a 3 Π 1 state shows a linear behavior up to approximately 1.84 Å, the values reach a maximum of about 0.1720 a.u., and then drop to zero at approximately 2.68 Å for this state. The curves of PDMs for a 3 Π 0 + and a 3 Π 1 states do not overlap when the internuclear distance is greater than approximately 2.50 Å, and there is still a local maximum 0.1196 a.u. of PDM for a 3 Π 0 + state at 4.60 Å. This is because the dissociation limits of a 3 Π 0 + and a 3 Π 1 states are different. The TDM for transition approaches zero at large distances owing to orbit-forbidden transition at the atomic limit from Ga( 2 P 1/2 ) to Ga( 2 P 3/2 ). Nevertheless, TDM for transition approaches zero at large distances because the dissociation limits of a 3 Π 1 and states are the same. That is, there is no transition at the atomic limits from Ga( 2 P 1/2 ) to Ga( 2 P 1/2 ). Fig. 7 shows that the maximum value of TDMs for transition is much larger than that for transition. However, each value of the two transitions at their equilibrium positions is listed in Table 3 , because they affect the emission rate A v . As seen in the table, TDM values for transition at equilibrium positions are much larger than those for . We know that a suitable rate of optical cycling is critical for the laser cooling of a molecule. In other words, shorter spontaneous radiative lifetime τ (10 −8 to 10 −5 s) 11,26 can be applied for rapid laser cooling. Note that the emission rate for transition is too small, while the radiative lifetime is too large [ τ (a 3 Π 0 + ) = 1.2033 × 10 −3 s]. Yet, the radiative lifetime of a 3 Π 1 state is 6.3210 × 10 −6 s, which can provide a significant rate of optical cycling. So, the transition is more promising for laser cooling of a GaH molecule.

However, the intervening state A1Π1 is prohibitive to the cooling cycle because of the large diagonal FCF f00 = 0.8749 and emission rate A00 = 5.7587 × 107 of the transition . Therefore, it is not possible to cool the GaH molecule based on spin-allowed transition.
From Soup: 26 FCFs can be used to describe the overlap degree of the vibrational wave functions for the transition. To demonstrate the distributions of FCFs for the different vibrational states of and transitions, we have listed all possible transitions between 0 ≤ v ≤ 3 and 0 ≤ v ′ ≤ 3 in Table 4 . For a 3 Π 0 + and a 3 Π 1 states, it is clear that Δ v = 0 bands have the highest transition probability. For example, the FCFs of and transitions reach 0.9099 and 0.9109, respectively. That is, GaH has highly diagonal FCFs. As seen in Table 4 , for transition, the calculated f 00 , f 10 , f 01 , f 11 , f 21 , and f 22 are 0.9109, 0.0885, 0.0741, 0.7982, 0.1197, and 0.7896, which match well with the experimental values of 0.918, 0.072, 0.086, 0.812, 0.115, and 0.792 reported by Rajamanickam et al. 55 Our results are in good agreement with the available experimental values, ensuring the reliability of our calculation.

From Soup: 27 However, computing the relevant FCFs is not enough for determining the cooling cycle because the vibrational branching ratios rather than FCFs are more directly related to the relative strengths of the photon loss pathways in the cooling cycle. 56 Here we also calculate the branching ratio R vv ′ , which can be expressed as R vv ′ = A vv ′ /∑ v ′ A vv ′ , where, A vv ′ is the emission rates for transition of the GaH molecule. Branching ratios of the diagonal terms R 00 = 0.9274 and R 11 = 0.8469 for are obtained; branching ratios of the off-diagonal are R 01 = 6.55 × 10 −2 , R 02 = 7.03 × 10 −3 , R 03 = 5.34 × 10 −5 , R 10 = 8.51 × 10 −2 , R 12 = 6.15 × 10 −2 , R 13 = 5.72 × 10 −3 are also calculated. The branching ratios to ν ′′ ≥ 3 states for of the GaH molecule are expressed as R 03+ and R 03+ < 8 × 10 −5 . Following the cooling scheme of Kobayashi et al. , 23 we propose a cyclic system with three lasers involving v = 0 and 1 for a 3 Π 1 state and v ′ = 0, 1, 2, and 3 for state based on the calculated R vv ′ . The proposed laser-driven transitions (solid red) and spontaneous decay (dotted line) are shown in Fig. 8 . The main pump to cool the GaH molecule is to derive transition, which require a laser with wavelength λ 00 = 588.49 nm. To enhance the cooling effect, we add two vibrational pumps with and transitions. As a consequence, two additional lasers with λ 10 = 646.03 nm and λ 21 = 643.37 nm are needed. For the second vibrational pump, N scat = 1/ R 03+ > 10 4 photons are scattered before the vibrational levels of the GaH molecule increased. Note that these three required laser cooling wavelengths are in the visible light range, where the continuous-wavelength laser radiation can be easily generated.
 ###### 
From cou.: 28 FCFs can be used to describe the overlap degree of the vibrational wave functions for the transition. To demonstrate the distributions of FCFs for the different vibrational states of and transitions, we have listed all possible transitions between 0 ≤ v ≤ 3 and 0 ≤ v′ ≤ 3 in Table 4. For a3Π0+ and a3Π1 states, it is clear that Δv = 0 bands have the highest transition probability. For example, the FCFs of and transitions reach 0.9099 and 0.9109, respectively. That is, GaH has highly diagonal FCFs. As seen in Table 4, for transition, the calculated f00, f10, f01, f11, f21, and f22 are 0.9109, 0.0885, 0.0741, 0.7982, 0.1197, and 0.7896, which match well with the experimental values of 0.918, 0.072, 0.086, 0.812, 0.115, and 0.792 reported by Rajamanickam et al.55 Our results are in good agreement with the available experimental values, ensuring the reliability of our calculation.
From Soup: 28 Here, we compared the GaH with other potential laser cooling candidates (BH, AlH, BaH, CaCl, BBr, and BeF molecules) with the three-electronic-level state. The diagonal FCFs ( f 00 ) and branching ratios ( R 00 and R 03+ ) are compared in Table 5 . Our calculated FCFs ( f 00 = 0.9109) of the GaH molecule is smaller than those of BH, AlH, BaH, and CaCl molecules. However, it is still large enough to stand out from the transitions between the other vibrational levels. That is, it can be compensated by the second and the third laser if the first FCF is not large enough. Actually, the vibrational branching ratios are directly related to the loss mechanism in the cooling cycle. As the decay to ( v ′ ≥ 3) state from a 3 Π 1 ( v = 3) state occurs with a negligible probability R 03+ < 8 × 10 −5 , the laser cooling scheme of the GaH molecule only requires one pump laser and two repump lasers. Table 5 also shows that the branching ratio R 03+ of GaH satisfactorily agrees with the values of BaH and CaCl molecules.
 ###### 
From cou.: 29 However, computing the relevant FCFs is not enough for determining the cooling cycle because the vibrational branching ratios rather than FCFs are more directly related to the relative strengths of the photon loss pathways in the cooling cycle.56 Here we also calculate the branching ratio Rvv′, which can be expressed as Rvv′ = Avv′/∑v′Avv′, where, Avv′ is the emission rates for transition of the GaH molecule. Branching ratios of the diagonal terms R00 = 0.9274 and R11 = 0.8469 for are obtained; branching ratios of the off-diagonal are R01 = 6.55 × 10−2, R02 = 7.03 × 10−3, R03 = 5.34 × 10−5, R10 = 8.51 × 10−2, R12 = 6.15 × 10−2, R13 = 5.72 × 10−3 are also calculated. The branching ratios to ν′′ ≥ 3 states for of the GaH molecule are expressed as R03+ and R03+ < 8 × 10−5. Following the cooling scheme of Kobayashi et al.,23 we propose a cyclic system with three lasers involving v = 0 and 1 for a3Π1 state and v′ = 0, 1, 2, and 3 for state based on the calculated Rvv′. The proposed laser-driven transitions (solid red) and spontaneous decay (dotted line) are shown in Fig. 8. The main pump to cool the GaH molecule is to derive transition, which require a laser with wavelength λ00 = 588.49 nm. To enhance the cooling effect, we add two vibrational pumps with and transitions. As a consequence, two additional lasers with λ10 = 646.03 nm and λ21 = 643.37 nm are needed. For the second vibrational pump, Nscat = 1/R03+ > 104 photons are scattered before the vibrational levels of the GaH molecule increased. Note that these three required laser cooling wavelengths are in the visible light range, where the continuous-wavelength laser radiation can be easily generated.
From Soup: 29 A shorter radiative lifetime τ of the transition can generate a powerful Doppler force, which will generate rapid laser cooling. Nevertheless, a longer radiative lifetime leads to a narrower linewidth Γ . So in order to attain a satisfactory laser cooling effect, τ and Γ should be carefully balanced. Based on the obtained TDMs, we calculate the τ s for all considered transitions of GaH, as shown in Table 3 . The natural linewidth Γ obtained for transition is 2.5178 × 10 4 Hz (= A v /2π), and the maximum acceleration of this transition is about 63.68 m s −2 (= ℏ kΓ /4 m , where m is the mass of the GaH molecule 23 ). In order to obtain ultracold GaH molecules by laser cooling, a preliminary cooling step (for example, with cryogenic buffer gas cooling) needs to be performed. Other molecules have been cooled to about 1 K by using a cold buffer gas. 7,57–59 Therefore, we calculate the minimum deceleration distance necessary to bring the velocity at 1 K of a GaH molecule to that suitable for trapping, which is about 2.77 m. Moreover, the permanent dipole of the GaH molecule helps reduce the distance. These data enforce the practicality of the transition as a laser cooling candidate. Actually, Shuman et al. bridged the gap between ultracold temperature (sub-millikelvin) and the 1 K temperature attainable with buffer gas cooling experimentally. 7 In addition, we calculate the recoil temperature ( T recoil ) to estimate the cooling effect. For transition, at a wavelength of 558.49 nm, the calculated T recoil value is about 868.71 nK (= h 2 / mkλ 2 60 ). Obviously, there is satisfactory cooling temperature.

From cou.: 30 Here, we compared the GaH with other potential laser cooling candidates (BH, AlH, BaH, CaCl, BBr, and BeF molecules) with the three-electronic-level state. The diagonal FCFs (f00) and branching ratios (R00 and R03+) are compared in Table 5. Our calculated FCFs (f00 = 0.9109) of the GaH molecule is smaller than those of BH, AlH, BaH, and CaCl molecules. However, it is still large enough to stand out from the transitions between the other vibrational levels. That is, it can be compensated by the second and the third laser if the first FCF is not large enough. Actually, the vibrational branching ratios are directly related to the loss mechanism in the cooling cycle. As the decay to (v′ ≥ 3) state from a3Π1(v = 3) state occurs with a negligible probability R03+ < 8 × 10−5, the laser cooling scheme of the GaH molecule only requires one pump laser and two repump lasers. Table 5 also shows that the branching ratio R03+ of GaH satisfactorily agrees with the values of BaH and CaCl molecules.

Scalar relativistic corrections are implemented using third-order Douglas–Kroll–Hess method for a Ga atom. The spectroscopic constants ( R e , ω e , ω e χ e , B e , D e , and T e ) of these states are obtained by solving the nuclear Schrödinger equation using the LEVEL8.2 program. The calculated spectroscopic constants for , a 3 Π 0 − , a 3 Π 0 + , a 3 Π 1 , and a 3 Π 2 states are in good agreement with the available experimental values. In addition, the calculated result shows that A 1 Π 1 and states have two potential wells. The equilibrium bond distances and vibrational frequencies for the two potential wells for A 1 Π 1 and states are also obtained for the first time.

From cou.: 31 A shorter radiative lifetime τ of the transition can generate a powerful Doppler force, which will generate rapid laser cooling. Nevertheless, a longer radiative lifetime leads to a narrower linewidth Γ. So in order to attain a satisfactory laser cooling effect, τ and Γ should be carefully balanced. Based on the obtained TDMs, we calculate the τs for all considered transitions of GaH, as shown in Table 3. The natural linewidth Γ obtained for transition is 2.5178 × 104 Hz (= Av/2π), and the maximum acceleration of this transition is about 63.68 m s−2 (= ℏkΓ/4m, where m is the mass of the GaH molecule23). In order to obtain ultracold GaH molecules by laser cooling, a preliminary cooling step (for example, with cryogenic buffer gas cooling) needs to be performed. Other molecules have been cooled to about 1 K by using a cold buffer gas.7,57–59 Therefore, we calculate the minimum deceleration distance necessary to bring the velocity at 1 K of a GaH molecule to that suitable for trapping, which is about 2.77 m. Moreover, the permanent dipole of the GaH molecule helps reduce the distance. These data enforce the practicality of the transition as a laser cooling candidate. Actually, Shuman et al. bridged the gap between ultracold temperature (sub-millikelvin) and the 1 K temperature attainable with buffer gas cooling experimentally.7 In addition, we calculate the recoil temperature (Trecoil) to estimate the cooling effect. For transition, at a wavelength of 558.49 nm, the calculated Trecoil value is about 868.71 nK (= h2/mkλ260). Obviously, there is satisfactory cooling temperature.
From Soup: 31 The curves of PDMs for , A 1 Π 1 , and states and TDMs for the spin-allowed transitions , , and are investigated based on the MRCI+Q method. The results indicate that transition has highly diagonal FCF of f 00 = 0.9600. However, the intervening state A 1 Π 1 is prohibitive to the cooling cycle because transition has a high emission rate A 00 = 5.7727 × 10 7 s −1 . Therefore, the spin-forbidden transitions of and are calculated in the present study. TDMs for these two transitions and PDMs for , a 3 Π 0 + , and a 3 Π 1 states are also obtained using the MRCI+Q method. Fortunately, there are highly diagonal FCFs ( f 00 = 0.9109) and branching ratios ( R 00 = 0.9274) for transition. The suitable radiative lifetime for a 3 Π 1 state ( τ = 6.3210 × 10 −6 s) is also derived from the GaH molecule. These conditions ensure the rapid and efficient laser cooling of the GaH molecule. An optical scheme of three laser cycles with transition to create an ultracold GaH molecule is proposed. The main cycling laser wavelength λ 00 = 588.49 nm is determined for transition, and two additional lasers with λ 10 = 646.03 nm and λ 21 = 643.37 nm are obtained for and transitions. We can conclude that this scheme allows sub-microkelvin GaH molecules to be rapidly produced after preliminary cooling with cryogenic buffer gas.

Scalar relativistic corrections are implemented using third-order Douglas–Kroll–Hess method for a Ga atom. The spectroscopic constants (Re, ωe, ωeχe, Be, De, and Te) of these states are obtained by solving the nuclear Schrödinger equation using the LEVEL8.2 program. The calculated spectroscopic constants for , a3Π0−, a3Π0+, a3Π1, and a3Π2 states are in good agreement with the available experimental values.
