From cou.: 1 This Perspective addresses the use of coupled diabatic potential energy surfaces (PESs) together with rigorous quantum dynamics in full or reduced dimensional coordinate spaces to obtain accurate solutions to problems in nonadiabatic dynamics. A recently developed technique for obtaining the requisite diabatic PESs is reviewed. Three examples are considered in detail, two, H2O and NH3 photodissociation, are treated in the full dimensionality while for the third, phenol photodissociation, a reduced dimensionality treatment is used. In all three examples, nonadiabatic dynamics is dominated by conical intersections, near which the Born–Oppenheimer approximation fails. The role of the conical intersection induced geometric phase in the adiabatic representation, as evinced by the molecular Aharonov–Bohm effect, is discussed.

From cou.: 2 Although electronic degeneracies have long been known to profoundly affect spectroscopy,1,2 it was not until twenty five years ago that the first papers appeared3–5 that would lead to the current conventional wisdom concerning the origin of spin-conserving electronically nonadiabatic transitions. Early work6 in this now burgeoning field emphasized the electronic structure aspects of nonadiabatic processes, including the key role of conical intersections (CIs), the notion of the branching plane7 and ultimately its definition in terms of orthogonal, g and h vectors.8 As described by Michl,9 the essential advance in this work was the removal of the symmetry requirement for CIs. As algorithms to locate CIs emerged,10–14 it became clear that CIs were much more prevalent than previously realized. But nonadiabatic processes require the solution of the nuclear dynamics problem for a complete description of the process at hand. Early work by a group in Heidelberg,15 which initially emphasized symmetry required and symmetry allowed16 CIs, was significant in this regard. Nuclear dynamics formulations explicitly focused on nonadiabatic processes would soon appear including exact quantum treatments for small systems17,18 and approximate approaches for larger ones, such as Full Multiple Spawning (FMS) and the related direct method ab initio Multiple Spawning (AIMS),19 the Multiconfiguration Time Dependent Hartree (MCTDH)20–22 approach and related direct dynamics methods.23 Here, the attribute “direct” refers to the fact that the electronic structure data are generated as required by an electronic structure program. It is to be contrasted with methods based on fit potential energy surfaces (PESs).24–29 Recognition of the breadth and importance of this field is provided by the large number and diverse foci of reviews that have appeared.15,16,30–48

From cou.: 3 In this Perspective, we describe how advances in representing electronic structure data, energies, energy gradients and derivative couplings and characterizing spin-conserving multielectronic state dynamics have combined to dramatically increase the accuracy with which nonadiabatic processes can be described. Not discussed here is nonadiabaticity due to spin–orbit coupling, because its impact is relatively minor for molecules made of light atoms. Nor will we discuss semi-classical treatments of nonadiabatic dynamics, for which excellent reviews exist.49,50 As far as the electronic structure data are concerned, we will focus on the use of coupled quasi-diabatic representations of adiabatic states including regions of CIs, referred to as fit quasi-diabatic PESs or fit quasi-diabatic representations. In a sense that will be made more precise below, the fit representation is better than the discrete electronic structure data from which it is derived since in addition to providing a convenient and accurate source of adiabatic PESs and their interactions, in the defined space the representation is complete, its derivative couplings are removable51 and the representation is devoid of the spurious singularities that can afflict quasi-diabatic representations deduced from auxiliary properties based criteria.52 The significant consequences of these observations will be discussed.

From cou.: 4 As currently implemented, our fit representations include both static and dynamic correlations through the use of accurate multireference configuration interaction singles and doubles excitation (MRCISD) wave functions to determine the relevant electronic structure data, energies, energy gradients and derivative couplings.53,54 Differing from previous approaches where a few ab initio data were used to parameterize the PESs, the method discussed here employs a large number of ab initio data points in the fit, making the fit PESs globally accurate.27,28,55 Further improvement of accuracy is obtained by using diabat shifting56 to improve agreement with selected high accuracy experimentally or computationally determined energies. Nonadiabatic dynamics based on fit PESs has often been compared with on-the-fly dynamics, also called direct dynamics.19,23 A significant advantage of on-the-fly dynamics is the availability of the electronic wave functions at each time step. This makes it much easier to introduce (i) environments using molecular mechanics; and (ii) molecular properties including transition moments and/or the spin–orbit interaction (at least for light elements) into the dynamics simulation. On the other hand, fit diabatic representations (i) utilize more accurate wave functions; (ii) provide the electronic structure information at a particular point in nuclear coordinate space in a small fraction of the time required to solve the electronic Schrödinger equation in on-the-fly dynamics, enabling the use of quantum wave packets or longer and more accurate time propagations of quasi-classical trajectories with better statistics; (iv) smooth out the discontinuous energy gradients that frequently accompany changing orbital spaces; and (v) yield derivative couplings which are removable by the adiabatic-to-diabatic states (AtD) transformation. The need for smoothing, not available in direct dynamics, is not an uncommon occurrence in describing dissociative, multichannel, nonadiabatic processes, although flexible state averaging procedures may help in this regard.57–59 Removable derivative couplings, as explained below, greatly facilitate the study of one of the signature consequences of CIs the molecular Aharonov–Bohm (MAB) effect first described by Mead and Truhlar.60,61

From cou.: 5 The fit diabatic approach is essential to an accurate quantum characterization of nonadiabatic dynamics. Thanks to the non-local nature of quantum mechanics, direct dynamics approaches are very difficult to implement for “exact” quantum dynamics because the wave packet necessarily occupies a large configuration space in a coherent manner. Approximate quantum approaches based on Gaussian wave packet propagation are only accurate for short time events,19,23 and their validity in longer time dynamics has seldom been tested. Although the basic theory of photodissociation has been worked out some time ago,62 applications have been restricted to triatomic systems until recently.17 Thanks to advances in algorithm development and computational power, such “exact” quantum dynamics can now be studied with up to nine dimensions.63 For nonadiabatic problems, such as those in photochemistry, studies of quantum dynamics are most conveniently performed in the quasi-diabatic representation in order to avoid the singularities in the adiabatic representation. The availability of high-dimensional diabatic PESs has hence motivated “exact” quantum dynamical calculations of nonadiabatic dynamics in polyatomic systems, particularly photodissociation, as discussed below. As illustrated in this Perspective, the combination of an “exact” quantum mechanical treatment of nuclear dynamics with accurate description of the electronic motion in terms of ab initio coupled quasi-diabatic PESs has greatly advanced our understanding of nonadiabatic dynamics in small, but realistic systems. Such knowledge not only sheds valuable light on the fundamentally important issues in photochemistry, but is also vital in validating approximate quantum mechanical methods19,23 for treating larger nonadiabatic systems.

From cou.: 6 Fit quasi-diabatic representations, denoted Hd, are generally determined in two steps: the construction of diabatic bases, namely the diabatization, and then the fit of the diabatic data. Construction of diabatic bases has a long history,64 including seminal work on their existence, or lack thereof, by Baer65 and Mead and Truhlar.51 For a catalogue of approaches to diabatization, see ref. 28, 48 and 66–70.

From cou.: 7 The approach espoused in this Perspective involves the simultaneous fitting and diabatization of the ab initio electronic structure data, energies, energy gradients and derivative couplings.27,28,55 Conceptually, one can think of an Hd for 2 states, a 2 × 2 matrix. The energy and energy gradients define the spectrum, that is the diagonal elements and their local nuclear geometry dependence. The derivative coupling (a vector defined below), defines the angle which produces the rotation to nondiagonal form by minimizing the residual derivative coupling. Thus, although the rotation angle is a scalar quantity, it is its gradient that is being compared with ab initio derivative coupling. This approach, which is still being improved, has generated high accuracy, full dimensional, Hd to describe photodissociation in ammonia (two electronic states, one channel, six coordinates) NH3() + hν → NH3(Ã) → NH2(,Ã) + H;71 phenol (four electronic states, one channel, 33 internal coordinates) C6H5OH() + hν → C6H5OH(Ã) → C6H5O(,Ã) + H;56 and hydroxymethyl (three electronic states, three channels, nine internal coordinates) CH2OH() + hν → CH2O() + H, cis-,trans-HCOH() + H. The first two systems are discussed in Section IV, while an initial Hd for the third was previously reported72 and a more complete version is being prepared for publication.

Here, q denote the 3 N el electronic coordinates and c J satisfy ( H CSF − I E J ,( a ), ab ( R )) c J = 0 in the configuration state function (CSF) basis. V are determined by requiring that the H d determined energies, E K ,( a ), m , energy gradients and energy difference scaled derivative couplings ( E J ,( a ), m − E K ,( a ), m ) f J , K ,( a ), m agree in a least squares sense with the corresponding ab initio determined quantities determined on a set of points R ( n ) , 1 ≤ n ≤ N point . The capability of reproducing some ab initio data exactly by using Lagrange multipliers is also available.

From Soup: 65 R ( n ) are classified according to how they are selected. R ( n ) in the skeletal data set are an initial set of geometries, asymptotic structures, equilibrium structures, CIs, saddle points, chosen on the basis of the process being described. This skeletal data is then fit to an initial H d , enabling surface hopping trajectories using Truhlar's ANT program, 75 based on Tully's fewest switches model 75,76 to be run. These quasi-classical trajectories expand the domain of definition, a generalized volume in nuclear coordinate space surrounding the set of R ( n ) where the electronic structure data are well reproduced, to one appropriate for the problem at hand. In a scheme similar to the highly successful GROW algorithm of Collins and coworkers, 77,78 points determined by the classical trajectories are added to the R ( n ) set until a prescribed percentage of the trajectories (>99%) propagated for a fixed time, remain in the domain of definition. Making trajectories the arbiters of the domain of definition avoids a priori assumptions concerning the preeminent modes. This (initial) construction of H d is straightforward, albeit time consuming since the fit (a very large linear algebra problem 28 ) must be run for each batch of points added to the R ( n ) set. This method bears some similarities with the fitting of adiabatic PESs, 79–82 but is unique in its multi-state capability.

From Soup: 66 Once an initial fit has been completed, refinement of the number and kind of g ( l ) is accomplished with a recently developed efficient seeding algorithm which allows the expansion to be modified without starting the fitting process for scratch. This algorithm, described in ref. 83 , is essential to treating larger systems efficiently since for such systems the initial and final sets of g ( l ) can differ significantly.

From Soup: 67 Two points concerning H d and its eigenstates should be noted: (i) since the AtD transformation is determined from the derivative coupling rather than an auxiliary condition as in properties based diabatizations, spurious singularities, also called diabolical singularities, 52 in the AtD transformation are avoided; and (ii) the second issue follows from the observation that for all CIs (of states I , J ), regardless of the dimension of the molecule, through linear terms H d has the form where the y -axis is parallel to h I , J , the interstate coupling gradient given by h I , J ( R ) = ( c Î ) † ∇ H CSF c J , the x -axis is parallel to g I , J , the energy difference gradient given by 2 g I , J = h I , I − h J , J , 2 s I , J = h I , I + h J , J , σ x , σ z are Pauli matrices, g = ∥ g I , J ∥ and h = ∥ h I , J ∥.

From Soup: 68 Without loss of generality, the nuclear Hamiltonian in a quasi-diabatic representation assumes the following form where is the nuclear kinetic energy operator (KEO) and H d is N state × N state matrix as defined above. In some of the systems discussed below, the KEO is “exact” as no dynamical approximation is involved. The form of the KEO depends on the coordinates. For a molecular system with N atoms, there are 3 N − 6 nuclear degrees of freedom (DOFs). In practice, Jacobi coordinates are often used for dissociation processes as they give a natural representation of the “half-collision” process. 86 The wave packet is discretized using either grids or bases, or a combination of both. Grids are an ideal representation for the coordinate-dependent operators such as H d , but basis functions are often better in representing the KEO. 87 For radial DOFs, direct product bases are advantageous, but non-direct product bases are needed to avoid singularities in angular DOFs. Transformations between the grids and bases are needed in evaluating ĤΨ , but they are mostly straightforward.

In some of the systems discussed below, the KEO is “exact” as no dynamical approximation is involved. The form of the KEO depends on the coordinates. For a molecular system with N atoms, there are 3N − 6 nuclear degrees of freedom (DOFs). In practice, Jacobi coordinates are often used for dissociation processes as they give a natural representation of the “half-collision” process.86 The wave packet is discretized using either grids or bases, or a combination of both. Grids are an ideal representation for the coordinate-dependent operators such as Hd, but basis functions are often better in representing the KEO.87 For radial DOFs, direct product bases are advantageous, but non-direct product bases are needed to avoid singularities in angular DOFs. Transformations between the grids and bases are needed in evaluating ĤΨ, but they are mostly straightforward.
From Soup: 69 For photoinduced processes, the initial condition of the quantum system is well defined based on the Condon principle. The subsequent evolution of the excited state is best described in the time-dependent framework, in which the time-dependent Schrödinger equation is solved. 86 However, if only the energy domain properties are of interest, these properties can often be obtained without explicit time-propagation. One such approach is based on the so-called Chebyshev propagator T k ( Ĥ ) ≡ cos kθ with θ = arccos Ĥ , which has the unique property of a cosine evolution operator in the form of the Chebyshev polynomial. 88 Each propagation thus involves mostly the evaluation of the action of the Hamiltonian on to the previous wave packet. As a result, all energy properties can be obtained from a cosine Fourier transform of correlation functions in the Chebyshev order space, in analogy to the exponential Fourier transform of time correlation functions. 89 This Chebyshev approach has been successfully adapted for photodissociation, 90 among other applications. A distinct advantage is its higher accuracy and efficiency because the Chebyshev propagator need not be interpolated as in the case of the time propagator.

From Soup: 70 The determination of the absorption spectrum of a photochemical event is relatively straightforward as it often requires a short propagation. If final fragment internal state distribution is needed, however, the propagation needs be carried out until all flux has exited the interaction region. 62,90 Given the often large energies deposited into the molecule by the photon, the number of final ro-vibrational states of the fragments can be quite large, making the projection numerically challenging. Nonetheless, as demonstrated below, such projection holds the key to understanding the complete dissociation dynamics.

From Soup: 71 In this section, we describe in some detail accurate rigorous quantum mechanical treatments of the photodissociation of three molecules H 2 O, NH 3 , and C 6 H 5 OH producing a hydrogen atom and a cofragment. The water photodissociation through its B band involves three electronic states coupled by both CIs and the Renner–Teller interaction. With only three internal coordinates, the diabatized electronic structure data can be represented on a grid using spline interpolation. A detailed ro-vibrational analysis of the product state distribution, which is excellent agreement with experiment, is reviewed. The computational analysis of the nonadiabatic dynamics provides insights into the reaction mechanism. We next turn to ammonia photodissociation through its A band. With six internal coordinates the diabatic representation cannot be generated on a grid and the method of Section II is used. The quality of the diabatic representation is established by the accuracy of the spectral simulations of the absorption spectrum using full-dimensional quantum dynamics. The main thrust of this discussion is the revised assignment of the vibrationally mediated photodissociation (VMP) observations of the H-atom kinetic energy distributions, which were originally interpreted in terms of mode specific control of electronic branching. Finally, we consider nonadiabatic electronic tunneling in the photodissociation of low-lying vibrational levels of the S 1 state of phenol. In that section the determination of the fit using the method of Section II which treats all 33 internal coordinates even handedly, and its accuracy are discussed. A reduced dimensionality representation is developed and analyzed in terms of the topography of the vicinity of the minimum energy CI. The nuclear Schrödinger equation for S 1 photodissociation is solved in the full four-state diabatic representation using the reduced-dimensional model. Despite the reduced dimensionality of the representation, excellent agreement with the measured lifetime for the ground vibrational level of the S 1 state is found. Repeating the calculation in the standard adiabatic state representation raised interesting questions concerning the role of the geometric phase/molecular Aharonov–Bohm effect in the tunneling dynamics. This issue will be subject of future work.

From Soup: 72 The UV absorption spectrum of water starts with a weak and featureless band (A) near 60 000 cm −1 and a stronger and structured band (B) near 77 000 cm −1 . The first band is attributable to the purely repulsive Ã 1 A′′ state, which dissociates to H + OH( 2 Π). The B-band stems from excitation to the 1 A′ state, which is, in addition to the adiabatic dissociation channel leading to H + OH(Ã 2 Σ + ), coupled nonadiabatically to two lower states. Since this triatomic molecule necessarily has C s symmetry, CIs can only exist between its two 1 A′ states. Specifically, the 1 A′ and 1 A′ states form two one-dimensional seams of CIs, one with the collinear H–O–H configuration and the other with the collinear H–H–O configuration. 24,91 In addition, the 1 A′ state also forms a Renner–Teller (RT) pair with the Ã 1 A′′ state at linearity.

From Soup: 74 The nonadiabatic dynamics of water photodissociation in its B-band has been investigated by several theoretical groups using various H d . 100–107 In Fig. 1 , the adiabatic PESs of the three lowest-lying states of Jiang et al. 106 are shown. Both the CIs and RT interactions are evident. These PESs were fit to diabatized ab initio points obtained at the Davidson corrected MRCI/AVQZ level of theory using cubic splines, which is possible because of the smoothness of the diabatic PESs and their couplings. It is perhaps interesting to analyze the seam space of the CIs, which are lines in the three-dimensional nuclear coordinate space. The most relevant is the HOH CI, whose branching plane is described by an energy difference gradient, g , vector dominated by the O–H stretch, and an interstate coupling, h , vector comprised principally of HOH bending. The former coincides with the O–H bond cleavage and dissociation of water, while the latter is related to the OH fragment rotation. These two vectors play important roles in the nonadiabatic dissociation dynamics of water.

From Soup: 75 As shown in Fig. 1 , the Franck–Condon region of the 1 A′ state provides a strong force towards the HOH CI and linearity. The ensuing nonadiabatic transitions to lower electronic states are mostly direct and fast, leading to the dominance of the OH( 2 Π) fragment with little vibrational excitation and a large amount of rotational excitation. 93–99 The fast dissociation to OH( 2 Π) gives rise to product angular distributions that are parallel to the laser polarization for this parallel transition. 95–99 Using coupled diabatic PESs, the absorption spectrum, branching ratio, product state ro-vibrational state distributions, and differential cross sections have been computed using the Chebyshev propagator, and they were found to agree with experiment quantitatively. 105–107 An interesting observation is the oscillation of the OH rotational state distribution and their corresponding anisotropy parameter ( β ). 94 These oscillations have been attributed to the interference between fluxes emanating from the two CIs. 94,108 Since the nonadiabatic flux from the HHO CI is relatively minor, the interference is not particularly strong.

From Soup: 76 In the theoretical model included all three electronic states, the results suggested that the RT channel represents a minor contribution to the photodissociation of water in its B band. 108 This is not unexpected and underscores the dominance of the CI pathway. In Fig. 2 , the calculated rotational state distributions for OH( 2 Π, v = 0) are compared with experimental data at five photon wavelengths. The overall agreement is quite satisfactory, but the inclusion of the RT channel helps to improve the agreement. In addition, the fine structure of the OH( 2 Π) fragment bears signature of the two nonadiabatic pathways. 109 In this case, each rotational state of OH( 2 Π) splits into four sublevels thanks to spin–orbit coupling, 110 and the populations on the so-called Λ-doublet states are found to have strong propensities that shed light on the nonadiabatic dissociation dynamics. 111 Specifically, the highly excited rotational states are dominated by the A′ species, suggesting a nonadiabatic origin from the – CIs. On the other hand, a minority of moderately excited rotational states dominated by the A′′ species can be attributed to the –Ã RT pathway.

From Soup: 77 It should be pointed out in passing that RT does not necessarily have to be a minor channel, as in the photodissociation of H 2 O. In the photodissociation of HCO, for example, transitions to the ground electronic state from its Ã 2 A′′ state are exclusively due to RT coupling. 112–115 It has been shown that the RT coupling not only facilitates nonadiabatic dynamics, but also has a significant effect on the vibrational energy levels. 116

From Soup: 79 Due to the pyramidal-to-planar transition, the absorption spectrum of ammonia in the A band is dominated by a diffuse progression in the umbrella ( v 2 ) mode. 122–126 Many groups, focusing on photodissociation of ammonia from its ground vibrational state, have reported experimental detection of both product channels, 127–140 and showed that the photodissociation is dominated by nonadiabatic production of NH 2 ( 2 B 1 ). However, in the VMP experiments of Crim and coworkers, 134–136 photodissociation of excited vibrational states was investigated using IR–UV double resonance excitation. These investigators found that the H atoms produced from the 3 1 state [ v 3 = 1] at 3444 cm −1 were predominantly slow, whereas those produced by pre-exciting the 1 1 state [ v 1 = 1] at 3336 cm −1 consists of a mixture of fast and slow hydrogen atoms. These authors concluded that the former must be dominated by electronically excited NH 2 (Ã 2 A 1 ) via the adiabatic pathway, with the latter dominated by NH 2 ( 2 B 1 ) produced nonadiabatically. 135 This remarkable control of nonadiabatic dynamics in VMP was rationalized in terms of mode specificity in accessing the CI seam shown in Fig. 3 .

From Soup: 80 Despite much work, 120,141–152 theoretical studies of the mode-specific nonadiabatic dissociation of NH 3 had been unable to confirm the experimental claim. 150,151 To address this challenge, a series of state-of-the-art full-dimensional quantum-state resolved nonadiabatic calculations 71,153–156 on very accurate coupled PESs 28,55 obtained using the algorithm described in Section II, based on accurate MRCISD ab initio data, 153 were initiated. These calculations reproduced almost all measurements, including the absorption spectra and final state distributions of the NH 2 fragment for the A-band photodissociation of the vibrational ground state of NH 3 , 71,153–156 thus firmly establishing the accuracy of the PESs and their couplings. Illustrative is an initial report of the lifetimes of the individual levels of the v 2 progression of NH 3 (Ã), which have been measured by several groups. 122–125 Fig. 4 demonstrates the excellent agreement between theory and experiment. Since v 2 is not a dissociative mode, the lifetimes of the v 2 levels are related to the subtle effects of intramolecular vibrational energy transfer in the Franck–Condon region, which are seen to be well described by the determined representation.

From Soup: 81 In Fig. 5 , the calculated and measured H-atom kinetic energy distributions for the VMP from the 1 1 state of NH 3 ( 1 A 1 ) are compared at two energies used in the measurements (46 208 and 48 911 cm −1 ). 156 The calculated distributions were generated by Gaussian convolution with a fixed full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of 200 cm −1 . At the lower energy ( Fig. 5a ), 134 the NH 2 (Ã 2 A 1 ) channel is closed and only NH 2 ( 2 B 1 ) fragments are produced. It can be seen that both the theoretical and experimental distributions are broad and have many oscillatory structures, which correspond to rotationally excited states of NH 2 ( 2 B 1 , v 2 = 0, 1) with the well-known N ∼ K a propensity. 127 Since this energy (46 208 cm −1 ) corresponds to the 0 0 0 resonance peak in the absorption spectrum, its distribution is very similar to that reported for photodissociation of vibrationally unexcited NH 3 , 155 but with a lower intensity due to unfavorable Franck–Condon overlap. At the higher energy ( Fig. 5b ), 136 however, some NH 2 (Ã 2 A 1 ) is produced, but the population is small, consistent with recent non-final-state resolved calculations. 71 The theory-experiment agreement is quite satisfactory as the overall shapes and line spacing of the measured distributions are well reproduced, although some differences are seen at low energies, presumably due to the difficulties in detecting slow H atoms experimentally.

From Soup: 82 Fig. 6 compares the calculated and measured H-atom kinetic energy distributions for the VMP from the v 3 = 1 state of NH 3 ( 1 A 1 ) at the experimental energy of 49 972 cm −1 . 156 There are two degenerate states for the asymmetric stretching mode. The average of the two, largely equivalent results is reproduced. The calculated H-atom kinetic energy distribution compares favorably with the experimental result. Unlike the v 1 = 1 VMP result, the distribution for the v 3 = 1 VMP is dominated by slow H atoms. However, only a small population of NH 2 (Ã 2 A 1 ) is predicted. Instead, as shown in Fig. 6b , the slowly recoiling H atoms can be largely attributed to internal excitation of the NH 2 ( 2 B 1 ) fragment with bending ( v 2 ) quanta up to 6, and the N ∼ K a propensity preserved. This attribution contrasts strongly with those made in the experimental studies where the slow H-atom distribution in the v 3 = 1 VMP was attributed to the production of the excited adiabatic H + NH 2 (Ã 2 A 1 ) channel. The theoretical results unequivocally indicate that the earlier experimental attribution is unlikely to be correct.

From Soup: 83 To shed light on the high bending and rotational excitations of the NH 2 ( 2 B 1 ) fragment, quasi-classical surface hopping trajectory studies were carried out on the same set of coupled PESs used in the quantum dynamical studies. 156 The analysis showed that the bending and rotational excitations in the NH 2 ( 2 B 1 ) fragment are largely gained during the nonadiabatic transitions near the CI seam. The forces acting on these trajectories immediately before and after the hop can be described by the g and h vectors. For the sampled trajectories the geometry where the last surface hopping event took place are dominated by linear combinations of three motions: the translational motion of departing H atom, the out-of-plane umbrella motion that becomes the head-over-heels rotation of NH 2 , and the bending of the H–N–H angle in the NH 2 fragment. This analysis suggests that the high rotational and bending excitations in the NH 2 ( 2 B 1 ) fragment can be partially attributed to the force acting on the molecule as it transitions from the Ã to state. It was concluded that where along the CI seam the surface hop occurs is key and that location depends on the mode excited.

From Soup: 84 A key issue in photodissociation is the existence of unifying themes, that is, arrangements of topographical features, such as minima, saddle points and CIs, that provide outcomes of general utility and interest. These paradigms should be assessed using a combination of reliable electronic structure calculations and quantum nuclear dynamics with fit H d representations being particularly useful in this regard.

From Soup: 87 has been the subject of both experimental 157–167 and theoretical 29,55,56,59,168–178 studies. We will be referring to adiabatic states, diabatic states, equilibrium structures and dissociated equilibrium structures. Before proceeding we organize the notation used to label these wave functions. There are 4 singlet adiabatic states which for general geometries will be denoted (1 1 A, 2 1 A, 3 1 A, 4 1 A) or (S 0 , S 1 , S 2 , S 3 ). Near the ground state equilibrium geometry of phenol, which has no spatial symmetry, spectroscopic notation is used so the 1 1 A state is denoted 1 A. In the product channel near the phenoxyl equilibrium structures, spectroscopic notation requires the 1 1 A state be denoted 2 B 1 and 2 1 A state be denoted Ã 2 B 2 since phenoxyl has C 2v symmetry. The lowest three diabatic states are labeled by their near (phenol) equilibrium structures 1 ππ, 1 ππ* and 1 πσ*, which have, using C 2v (actually as explained below G 4 ) symmetry labels, 1 A 1 , 1 B 2 and 1 B 1 symmetry These symmetry labels are preserved as the O–H bond is stretched into the product channel where the phenoxyl fragment as noted above has C 2v point group symmetry.

From cou.: 88 has been the subject of both experimental157–167 and theoretical29,55,56,59,168–178 studies. We will be referring to adiabatic states, diabatic states, equilibrium structures and dissociated equilibrium structures. Before proceeding we organize the notation used to label these wave functions. There are 4 singlet adiabatic states which for general geometries will be denoted (11A, 21A, 31A, 41A) or (S0, S1, S2, S3). Near the ground state equilibrium geometry of phenol, which has no spatial symmetry, spectroscopic notation is used so the 11A state is denoted 1A. In the product channel near the phenoxyl equilibrium structures, spectroscopic notation requires the 11A state be denoted 2B1 and 21A state be denoted Ã2B2 since phenoxyl has C2v symmetry. The lowest three diabatic states are labeled by their near (phenol) equilibrium structures 1ππ, 1ππ* and 1πσ*, which have, using C2v (actually as explained below G4) symmetry labels, 1A1, 1B2 and 1B1 symmetry These symmetry labels are preserved as the O–H bond is stretched into the product channel where the phenoxyl fragment as noted above has C2v point group symmetry.
From Soup: 88 The focus of this Perspective is a potentially generalizable topography that has been identified in phenol photodissociation, 169 as pictured in Fig. 7a . In this figure, it is shown that the S 1 minimum, which has phenol ring based 1 ππ* character (at relative energy, 0 cm −1 ) is connected with two symmetry equivalent saddle points (at 5152 cm −1 ), which are separated by a symmetry-allowed CI (at 5889 cm −1 ) involving the S 1 state and the S 2 state which has dissociative 1 πσ* character. This topography resembles a C s symmetry Jahn–Teller double cone 179 which is dissociative on one end. The key topographical features are the energetically accessible adiabatic paths around the point of CI involving the two saddle points. The dissociation of low-lying vibrational levels of the S 1 state can only proceed by tunneling, and can evolve nonadiabatically via the CI coupling the S 1 and S 2 states or adiabatically on S 1 . See Fig. 7b . Dissociation attributable to nonadiabatic dynamics from the S 1 minimum has been studied by, among others, Domcke and coworkers 59,169,170 and by Ashfold, Dixon and coworkers 118,171,173 using reduced-dimensional models. Full-dimensional dissociation dynamics was investigated using semiclassical methods, 176 with and without tunneling, on three full-dimensional coupled PESs, fit to a large number of points determined from the multi-configuration quasi-degenerate perturbation theory using the anchor-points reactive potential method. 29

From Soup: 91 A key element of this work is the symmetry of the diabatic states and the coordinate dependence of the diabatic state energies. The large amplitude motion exhibited by phenol dissociation precludes the use of point group symmetry to describe nuclear motion. Instead, it is appropriate to use the permutation inversion group symmetry. 73 Since the O–H bond is broken in the photodissociation of phenol, only one concerted permutation of the atoms is feasible: the simultaneous permutation of the entire benzene ring (2,6)(3,5)(8,12)(9,11), where ( i , j ) denotes a transposition of atoms i and j. See Fig. 8 for numbering of atoms. This molecular symmetry group, 74 the feasible subgroup of the complete permutation inversion group, is the direct product of inversion and the aforementioned permutation operations. It is isomorphic to the G 4 permutation inversion group 173,180,181 and the C 2v point group. The characters of the diabatic states can be determined at geometries that have point group symmetry where the point group operations can be mapped to molecular symmetry group operations. For C s geometries point group symmetry will be a proper subgroup of the molecular symmetry group.

From Soup: 92 Depending on the arrangement and orientation of the C 1 O 7 H 13 moiety relative to the benzene ring (taken as planar) phenol will exhibit three point-group symmetries: (i) C 2v : for C 1 O 7 H 13 collinear and along the C 4 C 1 axis (the highest energy structures); (ii) C s -planar: for C 1 O 7 H 13 planar and in the benzene plane (the lowest energy structures); and (iii) C s -bijct: for C 1 O 7 H 13 planar and in a plane perpendicular to the benzene ring and containing the C 4 C 1 axis. Table 1 provides the C 2v – C s correlations. Calculations in the Franck–Condon region for C s -planar structures demonstrate that the first four states carry 1 A′, 1 A′, 1 A′′, and 1 A′′ symmetries, respectively. At structures with C s -bijct symmetry the first four states carry 1 A′, 1 A′′, 1 A′, and 1 A′′ symmetries, respectively. Therefore, using Table 1 the lowest state carries 1 A 1 symmetry and the remaining states carry 1 B 2 , 1 B 1 and 1 A 2 symmetry in G 4 . A similar result is obtained using an energy optimized C 2v structure in the Franck–Condon region but since these states are much higher in energy in this region problems with root switching could have been encountered. Using C 2v point group symmetry in the dissociation channel shows that the four low-lying states of phenoxyl carry 1 B 1 , 1 B 2 , 1 A 2 and 1 A 1 , symmetries, respectively. Thus, it is necessary to include four states to account for the change in the 1 A 1 state from the ground state in the Franck–Condon region to the 4 1 A excited state in the phenoxyl channel. To illustrate these ideas, Fig. 9a reports the diabatic states and their energy dependence for a coplanar path explained in that figure. The corresponding adiabatic state energies are reported in Fig. 9b .

From Soup: 94 In this section, the construction of a shifted H d , H d , s , which has the form is described. Only the 1 B 1 and 1 B 2 diabats are shifted. The shifts introduced to construct H d , s reflect: (i) the energies of the ground state minimum and first excited state minimum of phenol; (ii) the vertical excitation energy of the 3 1 A state; and (iii) the energies of the ground and first excited state minima of phenoxyl. For the nascent, unshifted H d , the product channel T 0 (Ã 2 B 2 -phenoxyl) is 11 365 (8549) cm −1 which is 2816 cm −1 greater than the experimental value given parenthetically. Similarly, the T 0 value for the Ã 1 A′ state of phenol is 38 177 (36 377) cm −1 which is 1800 cm −1 greater than the experimental value given parenthetically. Finally, the vertical excitation energy of the 3 1 A state is 47473.4 (46459.0) cm −1 which is 1014 cm −1 higher than the CASPT2 estimate of ref. 182 (their Table 8, 5.76 eV) given in parenthesis. From the energetics noted above and diabats pictured in Fig. 9a , it is seen that the discrepancies can be reduced by shifting the 1 B 2 diabat down by 1800.1 cm −1 , (to correct T 0 (Ã 1 A′) – a 1772 cm −1 improvement is found) and shifting the 1 B 1 diabat down by 1039.2 cm −1 , (to correct the vertical excitation energy of the 3 1 A state – a 1037 cm −1 improvement is found). T 0 (Ã 2 B 2 -phenoxyl) will also improve by the difference in these shifts ∼760 cm −1 (764 cm −1 is found). The changes in the electronic energies are mirrored in the zero point energy (ZPE) adjusted quantities, the T 0 values, since the differences in the H d and H d , s determined ZPEs are small, for phenol( ), −13 cm −1 , phenol(Ã), 14 cm −1 , phenoxyl( ), 10 cm −1 , and phenoxyl(Ã), 7 cm −1 . Comparing Fig. 9a and b , it is seen that the coupling of the diabats near R (O–H) ∼ 3.5. a.u. precludes shifting of the adiabatic states to correct energy errors.

For the H d and ab initio determined representations, the points in Fig. 10a and b were obtained by constraining the CO bond distance to the indicated value on the abscissa while optimizing the remaining coordinates to minimize the energy of the CI. The CO distance was chosen because of its significant energy dependence, as well as the observed strong vibration of this mode in classical trajectories. These plots confirm the MEX character of the predicted R n . More significantly, the energetics and g , h norms are shown to be well reproduced by the fit along these two seam cuts. Since only the minimum energy crossing points are included in the R ( n ) used in the fit, the remaining H d determined results are predictions, and support the quality of the H d representation of the CI seams.

Also reported are the ab initio determined (filled diamonds) energies of the 1 1 A, 2 1 A, 3 1 A adiabatic states, which are seen to be well reproduced by the H d determined (solid lines) values. The small differences in the norms of the ab initio and H d determined derivative couplings, particularly near the peaks, MEXs, demonstrates the quasi-diabatic character of the representation. The difference in the couplings cannot vanish completely, since H d does not describe, and in any case could not eliminate, the nonremovable part 51 of the derivative coupling which is part of the ab initio determined values. In addition, the ab initio determined derivative couplings contain a part which is not translationally invariant and as discussed in ref. 183 is related to the electron translation factors. This, again small, contribution is by construction absent in the H d determined quantities. Thus, H d provides a translationally invariant, removable approximation to the derivative coupling.

From Soup: 106 Fig. 12 depicts the OH stretch, COH bend, and CCOH torsion, ( R , θ , φ), in the three-dimensional (3D) model.

This choice is also supported by the analysis of the g and h vectors for the CI connecting S 1 and S 2 states. These two vectors define a unique plane, the branching plane of the CI, which allows for the conceptual separation of the CI coordinates from the remaining nuclear DOFs, regardless of the size of the molecule and play a crucial rule in both describing and computing nonadiabatic transitions near CIs. When phenol normal vibrational mode vectors are projected onto the mass scaled g and h vectors at the MEX of this CI, the largest overlaps (0.927 with g and 0.934 with h ) are the O–H vibration and the C–C–O–H torsional coordinate, respectively. 178 This analysis thus supports the argument of Lan et al. 169 that these two coordinates are the main participants of the nonadiabatic tunneling involving the S 1 –S 2 CI.

From Soup: 107 The few lowest vibrational levels are above the dissociation asymptote, but significantly below both the S 1 dissociation saddle point and the MEX for the S 1 –S 2 CI seam, which are respectively 5152 and 5889 cm −1 above the S 1 minimum with a planar ( φ = 0) geometry. Hence, these levels are predissociative, with dissociation facilitated by tunneling via either the CI or through the S 1 saddle points. It is difficult to accurately characterize the multidimensional tunneling dynamics without quantum mechanics. Even with the 3D model, a brute-force approach is impractical because the propagation required is too long for these long-lived (∼ns) resonances. A low-storage filter diagonalization method based on the Chebyshev propagator 89 was used to computing their lifetimes τ = 1/ Γ , in which the Chebyshev wave packet was propagated and the resulting correlation functions were used to build an energy-localized Hamiltonian matrix, from which the complex energies of the resonances ( E − i Γ /2) were obtained.

Clearly, the lifetimes are mode specific and isotope dependent. This is consistent with previous quantum dynamical calculations in reduced dimensions. 59,169,174 For the lowest vibrational level (0 0 ) of phenol on the S 1 state, our calculated lifetime of 2.29 ns is in very good agreement with the experimental values of 2.4 ± 0.3 ns, 185 and 2.2 ± 0.1 ns, 166 and >1.2 ns. 167 The much longer lifetime for C 6 H 5 OD is consistent with the absence of an experimentally measurable D signal. 159 It is also consistent with theoretical estimates of a 10 3 reduction of the tunneling probability upon deuteration. 173 This level of agreement with the experimental tunneling lifetimes indicates that the tunneling dynamics is reasonably well described by the 3D model.

This is consistent with previous quantum dynamical calculations in reduced dimensions.59,169,174 For the lowest vibrational level (00) of phenol on the S1 state, our calculated lifetime of 2.29 ns is in very good agreement with the experimental values of 2.4 ± 0.3 ns,185 and 2.2 ± 0.1 ns,166 and >1.2 ns.167 The much longer lifetime for C6H5OD is consistent with the absence of an experimentally measurable D signal.159 It is also consistent with theoretical estimates of a 103 reduction of the tunneling probability upon deuteration.173 This level of agreement with the experimental tunneling lifetimes indicates that the tunneling dynamics is reasonably well described by the 3D model.
From Soup: 109 To illustrate the tunneling dynamics, the time-independent diabatic wave functions of the 1 ππ* and 1 1 πσ* states corresponding to the 0 0 resonance of C 6 H 5 OH is shown in Fig. 13 , in which θ is fixed at 109.5°. It is shown that the wave functions are mostly near the planar ( φ = 0) region in the vicinity of the S 1 –S 2 MEX (marked in the figure by ●). Furthermore, it is clear from the figure that the two diabatic wave functions are qualitatively different. The preeminent contributor (99.8% of the norm) on the 1 ππ* diabatic state is nodeless in φ , while that on the 1 πσ* diabatic state has a node at φ = 0. The drastic difference stems from the fact that the total vibronic symmetry of the 1 ππ* and 1 1 πσ* diabat states, which have A′ and A′′ electronic symmetries in planar geometries, respectively, must be the same. The nonadiabatic transition through the CI necessitates a switch of the vibrational character. Since the total (electronic and nuclear) wave function has to be symmetric, the nuclear wave function on the 1 πσ* state has to be antisymmetric. Indeed, the off-diagonal element ( V 23 ) between the two diabatic states, which facilitates the transition, has antisymmetric reflection symmetry with respect to φ = 0.

From Soup: 111 The tunneling lifetimes using a fully quantum mechanical adiabatic model, in which only the S 1 adiabat was used in solving the Schrödinger equation were also reported. 178 For the 0 0 resonance of phenol, the adiabatic tunneling lifetime is calculated to be 0.027 ns, about 100 times shorter than the correct value obtained with H d , s . This large difference demonstrates that the single state adiabatic model is not appropriate for the description of tunneling near a CI. One likely reason is a manifestation of the geometric phase effect 1,85 known as the molecular Aharonov–Bohm (MAB) effect, 60,61 induced by the S 1 –S 2 CI, shown in Fig. 7 . In the adiabatic approximation without the inclusion of the geometric phase, tunneling can only occur by passing under the adiabatic barrier, which leads to no change of symmetry in the nuclear wavefunction. However, when the geometric phase is included, the paths through the two equivalent sides of the CI interfere destructively outside the CI, leading to the retardation of the tunneling flux and the unmistakable node in the wavefunction. 186–189 Hence, quantification of the MAB effect requires explicit inclusion of the geometric phase in the single state adiabatic model. In the diabatic representation, the MAB effect, as reviewed below, is not explicitly required.

From Soup: 113 When the available energy exceeds that of the relevant seams of CI, nonadiabatic dynamics in the diabatic representation is the preferred approach. This is a consequence of the energetically accessible singularities in the derivative couplings that are encountered in the adiabatic representation at CIs. When the available energy is only sufficient to populate a single PES, the standard single adiabatic state approach would appear to be preferred. In this case, the vibronic wave function is written as where χ I v ( R ) is a single-valued “vibrational” wave function. However, this ignores the potential involvement of the molecular Aharonov–Bohm (MAB) effect, described by Mead and Truhlar approximately 35 years ago. 60,61 The MAB effect accounts for the effect of the geometric phase on a real-valued adiabatic electronic wave function Ψ ( a ) I ( q ; R ). 1,85 Since Ψ ( a ) I ( q ; R ) changes sign after traversing a closed loop, it is double-valued and so is the total wave function in eqn (11) . This unacceptable situation can be partially corrected by multiplying the electronic wave function by a complex phase exp( iA ( I ) ( R )), whose sole purpose is to make the total wave function, Ψ T v ( q ; R ), single-valued. Mathematically Here, it is important to emphasize that although CIs of two states are involved, the dynamics takes place on a single adiabatic PES. Mead has pointed out that in reactive scattering problems the MAB effect can alter the effects of quantum mechanical interference, 190 which is supported by more recent numerical calculations. 191–195

From Soup: 114 The challenge in addressing the MAB effect is the determination of the phase factor exp( iA ( I ) ( R )), which can be included in a modified Hamiltonian as a vector potential. 60 This requires either explicit or tacit knowledge of the locus of the seam CI and a way to determine that a path around the CI has been traversed. In the past, the later has been accomplished by using a coordinate system that explicitly describes motion around the seam. These requirements have restricted studies of the MAB effect to homonuclear triatomic molecules, 192,196,197 where the locus of the seam is determined by symmetry and loops around the seam readily expressed in mass-weighted hyperspherical coordinates. 192,196 From eqn (7) and (8) , it is seen that has the desired properties provided the restriction to an infinitesimal loop is removed. As a result, it is entirely possible to determine, albeit approximately, the phase factor explicitly from the H d derivative coupling terms. This could be vital for studying MAB effects in polyatomic systems beyond triatomic systems. Even when this phase factor can be accurately determined, however, a first principles characterization of the MAB effect in multiple dimensions has to overcome singularities associated with both the derivative coupling and the vector potential near the CI in the nuclear dynamics. In future work we will show how to deal with these issues.

From Soup: 115 In this Perspective, the case is made for the value of the coupled diabatic state representation, H d constructed from fitting high quality ab initio electronic structure data that include both static and dynamic correlation. A recently introduced flexible yet accurate procedure for constructing that H d , which is capable of describing multistate problems in systems the size of phenol, is reviewed. While the construction of H d is not without its challenges, as this Perspective demonstrates, the resulting coupled diabatic PESs, particularly when combined with rigorous quantum mechanical dynamics, can produce results of unprecedented accuracy and insights into nonadiabatic dynamics. These accurate models can then be used to calibrate more approximate theories and improve them.

From Soup: 116 While H d are best used with full quantum dynamics, at present that is not always possible. In this case, approximations are required. Here, we discussed the use of reduced dimensionality models under such circumstances with encouraging results. However, it is apparent that a reduced-dimensional model is not sufficient to provide a quantitative solution of a nonadiabatic problem as complicated as that of the phenol photodissociation. One fundamental shortcoming, for example, is the complete neglect of other modes that are not included in such a reduced-dimensional model. As a result, it is impossible to predict the multi-mode interaction during the dissociation and the product state distribution. One possible solution is to treat the problem with a multi-scale model, in which the strongly coupled modes are treated within the MCTDH framework while the remaining weakly coupled modes are treated as a bath. Such a strategy has been successfully applied in systems of similar complexity. 198

From Soup: 117 As discussed in this Perspective, nonadiabatic dynamics near a CI differs drastically from the more intuitive Born–Oppenheimer regime. Ample recent evidence has been accumulated indicating that our understanding of nonadiabatic dynamics is far from complete. For tunneling, for example, the lifetime of a vibrational state is not determined by the height and width of the adiabatic barrier. Rather, it is controlled by the strength and breath of the off-diagonal elements of H d , which are related to the derivative coupling in the adiabatic representation. Although the retardation of tunneling in photodissociation of phenol by the MAB effect due to the geometric phase is now well established, our understanding of how the position of the CI and the strength of the derivative coupling affect nonadiabatic dynamics is still very limited and more careful studies, even with reduced-dimensional models, are necessary. As many photochemical processes tunnel near CIs, nonetheless, the traditional adiabatic paradigm of tunneling might need be reconsidered.
