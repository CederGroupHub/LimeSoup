From cou.: 1 The L-arginine (Arg)/agmatine (Agm) antiporter AdiC is a vital transport protein of the arginine-dependent extreme acid resistance system of enteric bacteria. Recently, both substrate-free and Arg-bound structures of AdiC were determined by X-ray crystallography. In this article, the two different proteins were investigated with three simple models. Gaussian network model provided the information of conformational changes. It is found that Arg binding induces structural rearrangement in the extracellular domain, and transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) has the most pronounced trend of conformational changes. The moving directions of fluctuation regions were further ascertained by using anisotropy elastic network model and cross-correlation analysis. Interestingly, the two substrate-binding sites hypothesis of AdiC was confirmed directly by molecular docking. Furthermore, the binding preferences of these two sites were explained from the aspects of electrostatic complementarity and geometric matching. These simple coarse-grained analyses can be used as a general and quick method for the mechanism studies of transport proteins.

From cou.: 2 Transport proteins play vital roles in a variety of cellular functions.1–4 They are the gatekeepers for all cells and organelles, controlling uptake and efflux of crucial compounds such as amino acids, nucleotides, sugars, inorganic ions and drugs. Numerous studies5–7 have suggested that these proteins can modulate drug levels within the body by regulating their absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination. However, it is very difficult to get the highly ordered three-dimensional membrane protein crystals for structure determination by X-ray crystallography.8,9 Despite their obvious importance, the structural information on transport proteins is still relatively sparse. There is even less knowledge about their recognition and dynamical processes that are essential for functioning.10,11

From cou.: 3 Recently, the structural information of an important transporter, the L-arginine (Arg)/agmatine (Agm) antiporter AdiC, was reported by transmission electron microscopy12 and X-ray crystallography.13–15 AdiC belongs to the amino acid/polyamine/organocation (APC) transporter superfamily and this protein has 15–17% sequence identities to eukaryotic and human APC transporters. It is a key component of the Arg-dependent extreme acid resistance system of enteric bacteria. In extremely acidic environments, the enteric bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, can rely on AdiC to expel protons by exchanging intracellular Agm for extracellular Arg.16,17 Thus, they can survive in the human stomach and cause intestinal diseases.

From cou.: 4 In the Shi et al. studies,13,14 both substrate-free and Arg-bound structures of AdiC were determined by X-ray crystallography. They analyzed the conformational changes of these two states in the AdiC transport process and suggested a probable recognition mechanism of the two substrate-binding sites. However, several questions still need to be answered. There are remarkable conformational transitions in the transport process of AdiC. Are they the intrinsic properties of the system and can they be predicted from the structure alone? Do the two substrate-binding sites really exist? If so, how can we distinguish the different preferences by simulation methods?

From cou.: 5 To answer the above questions, we used three coarse-grained methods, including the Gaussian network model (GNM), anisotropy elastic network model (ANM) and docking method, to analyze the structures of AdiC. Since the systems of AdiC proteins are very large and the resolved resolution is about 3.0 Å, the coarse-grained methods are more suitable than the high resolution models to study their recognition and transport mechanisms. GNM is a schematic and topology-based model which is independent of sequence specificity.18,19 GNM can provide information on conformational transition of proteins from the crystal structures and does not require the high computational cost of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Recently, some methods based on GNM were proposed to study transport proteins20,21 and large-scale domain motions.22–24 The dynamical information obtained with the GNM was surprisingly in agreement with the experimental and MD simulation data. Meanwhile, the ANM25,26 is an extension of the GNM. Information about the directions of conformational transition can be obtained from analysis with the ANM. The third method, molecular docking technology, is an effective tool for exploring the interaction mechanism of protein receptors with ligands.27–29 In the docking study, several factors including the geometric matching,30,31 electrostatic filter,32,33 and statistical potential functions,34,35 have been combined in scoring the complex structures, which can provide reasonable explanations for the recognition mechanism.

The crystal structure of the substrate-free form is a homodimer and each monomer has 12 transmembrane segments. The unresolved segments of the substrate-free form are from V257 to A276 and from Y436 to A440. The crystal structure of the Arg-bound form includes only one monomer. Its unresolved residues are D6 and those from A181 to G191.

From Soup: 51 Parameters are important for docking experiments. In our calculations, most of the parameters were set as default values. In order to evaluate the surface complementarity more accurately, the grid spacing parameter was set as 0.5 Å. The Euler angular deviation was set as 12° and 9240 non-degenerate orientations were generated. Each orientation would have many docking results. In the screening stage, the electrostatic correlation score was used as a binary filter. The structures with a positive electrostatic correlation score were seen as the unfavorable conformations and they would be excluded from the candidate set. The structures which passed the electrostatic filter were sorted by the surface correlation scores. Finally, as the default setting of the program, the top 10 000 structures were kept for the ultimate scoring. An empirical scoring function, i.e. , the residue level pair potential, 35 was used to pick out the best docking results.

From Soup: 52 To evaluate the feasibility of the application of the GNM method in studying AdiC, the B-factors were calculated according to eqn (6) and compared with the data from X-ray crystallography. Fig. 3 shows the comparison between the calculated B-factors of Cα atoms and the experimental data from X-ray crystallography. In the first comparison of the substrate-free form, the theoretical B-factors were calculated based on the monomer structure. As shown in Fig. 3A , the correlation coefficient between the theoretical and experimental values is only 0.141. The obvious difference of B-factor values is mainly located in the C-terminal region, which is the contact interface between the two monomers. This result suggests that the monomer is not stable and the fluctuations of TM12 in the C-terminal region are greatly influenced by the other monomer. Therefore, the homodimer structure should be necessary for the stability and function of AdiC. To confirm this, the B-factors of the crystal structure consisting of the two monomers were also calculated. The correlation coefficients show a remarkable improvement with 0.600 for the second comparison of substrate-free form and 0.644 for the comparison of the Arg-bound form (see Fig. 3B and C ). The results are similar to those of recent studies for other proteins. 39,40 Finally, the only adjustable parameter γ in this work needs to be determined. It can be calculated by normalizing the theoretical distribution of the B-factors based on the experimental one. The resulting value used for the substrate-free structure is 8.992 Å 2 , and that for the Arg-bound structure is 5.367 Å 2 .

From Soup: 53 Functionally relevant motions of proteins can usually be represented by the slow and long-wavelength collective modes. 41 Fig. 4 displays the slowest modes of substrate-free and Arg-bound structures calculated by the GNM. Fig. 5 is the structure expression of the substrate-free form. As shown in Fig. 4 , there are three obvious increases for the substrate-free state at F23-G39, V161-T183 and M230-I240. In Fig. 5 , they are the extracellular domain. Residues from V161 to T183 correspond to TM5, TM6a (the N-terminal half of TM6) and the loop between them, which is the largest fluctuation region in the substrate-free form. The previous study 14 also found that the most dramatic changes occur to TM6 and the entire TM6a of the Arg-bound AdiC pivots around the unwound region by approximately 40°. The segment from F23 to G39 corresponds to TM1b (the C-terminal half of TM1), TM2 and the loop between them. Through structure comparison between substrate-free and Arg-bound states, 14 appreciable conformational differences were also observed in TM2, but the fluctuation range was less than TM6. The analysis of the slow mode can confirm that TM6 and TM2 have the trend of conformational changes in the substrate-free form and these regions have an influence on the swinging movement of the Arg-bound form. Residues from M230 to I240 correspond to the loop between TM7 and TM8. This region in the Arg-bound form becomes the peak of the fluctuation curve. It may have an important influence on the next transport step, which may cause the conformational shift of TM8 and open the middle gate of AdiC. From Fig. 4 , comparing the slowest modes of two structures, it can be seen that there are obvious decreases in the Arg-bound form. The fluctuations of the above extracellular domain are reduced even more remarkably. It implies that these regions are interacting with Arg and become stable in the Arg-bound structure. Thus, Arg binding is the key factor for these movements.

From Soup: 54 As shown in Fig. 4 , the two segments between dashed lines correspond to TM3 and TM10, respectively. The N-terminal part of TM3 and the C-terminal part of TM10 also have low fluctuation values, but the opposite parts have high fluctuation values. In the substrate-free and Arg-bound structures, the middle and distal gates remain closed. The reason is the tight interactions between E191 (in TM6) and Y87 (in TM3)/Y328 (in TM10). 14 Therefore, the N-terminal part of TM3 and the C-terminal part of TM10 maintain low fluctuation values in both curves. However, the C-terminal part of TM3 and the N-terminal part of TM10 have a trend of global slow motions. Therefore, when Arg disrupts the interactions between TM6 and TM3/TM10, the conformational changes will be caused in the C-terminal part of TM3 and the N-terminal part of TM10. Then, the middle and distal gates are opened. These results rationally explain the conformational shift of TM3 and TM10, and agree well with previous studies. 14

From Soup: 55 The above analyses from GNM provide the magnitude of displacement for large-scale motions, but the directions of motions remain unclear. Here, the slow collective modes of ANM were applied to ascertain these motion directions. For the substrate-free structure, as seen in Fig. 6A and B , the first and second slowest modes of the extracellular domain correspond to the swing motion. It also confirms that TM2 and TM6 have large fluctuations, and the moving trend is consistent with the direction of occluded conformational changes. As seen from Fig. 6C , the first slowest motion of Arg-bound is similar with that of the substrate-free form. However, the second slowest motion of Arg-bound is different from that of the substrate-free form, where the extracellular domain shows an opposite direction pivoting around the unwound region (see Fig. 6D ). It is known that AdiC is an amino acid antiporter, which transports Arg and Agm in opposite directions. Therefore, the extracellular domain should have the opening trend after the proximal gate closed, which can make the preparation for releasing of Agm.

From cou.: 56 The above analyses from GNM provide the magnitude of displacement for large-scale motions, but the directions of motions remain unclear. Here, the slow collective modes of ANM were applied to ascertain these motion directions. For the substrate-free structure, as seen in Fig. 6A and B, the first and second slowest modes of the extracellular domain correspond to the swing motion. It also confirms that TM2 and TM6 have large fluctuations, and the moving trend is consistent with the direction of occluded conformational changes. As seen from Fig. 6C, the first slowest motion of Arg-bound is similar with that of the substrate-free form. However, the second slowest motion of Arg-bound is different from that of the substrate-free form, where the extracellular domain shows an opposite direction pivoting around the unwound region (see Fig. 6D). It is known that AdiC is an amino acid antiporter, which transports Arg and Agm in opposite directions. Therefore, the extracellular domain should have the opening trend after the proximal gate closed, which can make the preparation for releasing of Agm.
From Soup: 56 The cross-correlations between the fluctuations of residues were calculated with eqn (5) . Fig. 7 presents the cross-correlation map of the substrate-free structure. It is obvious that the cross-correlation map is divided into two parts. The C-terminal regions ( i.e. , TM11 and TM12) have negative correlations with other parts. These two TMs are on the dimerization interface and primarily mediate the homodimerization of AdiC. Therefore, their motions are greatly influenced by the other monomer and have the lowest cross-correlation values with those of the other TMs. The part of TM6 (residues S178-V200) has strong correlations with parts of TM1 (residues G5-G33) and TM2 (residues Y38-F75). This confirms that TM2 and TM6 are the extracellular domain, and they have an influence on the conformational changes of the substrate-free structure. Meanwhile, it can be seen that these regions have weak correlations with the part of TM10 (residues L315-L338). It indicates that TM10 may have the opposite movement against the motions of TM2 and TM6. The Arg-bound structure also shows that TM10 has some conformational changes and swings in the opposite direction to TM2 and TM6. This cross-correlation analysis, based on the substrate-free structure, is well consistent with the movement of Arg-bound. In addition, as shown in Fig. 7 , TM10 has strong correlations with TM3 (residues L79-Y108). This result confirms the above slow mode analysis. These two TMs should cooperate with each other and ultimately open the middle and distal gates for the exchange of Arg and Agm.

From Soup: 57 To study the substrate-binding sites of AdiC, we used the 3D-Dock program to do a global scan of the whole conformational space. In our simulation, both Arg and Agm were docked with substrate-free and Arg-bound structures of AdiC (see Fig. 8 ). The geometric centers of the ligands can indicate the possible binding sites. As shown in Fig. 8 A, the receptor is the substrate-free form and the ligand is Arg. The geometric centers of the top 50 structures sorted by the scoring function of 3D-Dock are distributed dispersively and the distribution regions seem to be a pathway though the AdiC structure. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 8C , the geometric center distribution of Agm is also extending along the central axis. These results imply the underlying transport route, which are in good agreement with the previous study. 13 In contrast, for the bound docking, the geometric centers of Arg and Agm are more centralized and mainly located in two sites, one between the proximal and middle gates and the other between the middle and distal gates (see Fig. 8C and D ). Interestingly, Shi et al. 14 hypothesized that AdiC has two substrate-binding sites with different substrate-binding preferences for Arg and Agm, respectively. Our docking experiments confirm this hypothesis and even the binding sites are consistent with their model. Furthermore, the binding preferences of AdiC were analyzed in Table 1 . Along the three gates, we divided the transport route into 4 parts. As shown in Table 1 , for Arg docking, most of geometric centers are located in region 2, i.e. , the site between the proximal and middle gates. Whereas, for Agm docking, the geometric centers mostly distribute in region 3, i.e. , the site between the middle and distal gates. These results directly prove the substrate-binding preferences and surprisingly agree with the previous hypothesis. 14

From Soup: 58 Here, we further explain the binding preferences from docking results. Firstly, from the aspect of electrostatic complementarity, Agm owns two positive charges, but Arg has only one positive charge. There are several residues with negative charges in region 3, such as E191 (in the distal gate), which are more suitable for Agm recognition. Meanwhile, W185 and W256 are in region 2, which favors Arg binding. Secondly, from the aspect of geometric complementarity, the structure of Agm is without α-carboxylate group and smaller than that of Arg. As shown in Fig. 8D , the space of region 3 is smaller than that of region 2, so it has a better surface matching with Agm. In addition, when the receptor is the substrate-free form, there are also some ligands docked at regions 1 and 4. It can also be explained by the geometric complementarity. In the substrate-free form, some other regions also have enough spaces for ligand binding, so the nonspecific interactions are generated. When the extracellular domain closes the proximal gate, these regions are also filled and the nonspecific bindings are reduced.

From Soup: 59 From the above analyses, we can propose the recognition and transport mechanism of AdiC. In the ESI, † a schematic movie shows this proposed model. Firstly, the state of AdiC is substrate-free and outward open. Arg binds to its preference site and induces the swing motions of TM6, TM2 and TM10. TM10 has the opposite movement against the motions of TM2 and TM6, and the periplasmic gate closed by these motions. Then, Arg moves to the next recognition site and disrupts the tight interactions between E191 (in TM6) and Y87 (in TM3)/Y328 (in TM10). It can cause the conformational changes in the C-terminal part of TM3 and the N-terminal part of TM10. Thus, the distal gate is open and allows AdiC to adopt an inward-open conformation. Then, Agm replaces Arg and binds to its preference site. Next, Agm moves up to the position between the proximal and middle gates, and the middle and distal gates are closed. Finally, the extracellular domain swings to open the proximal gate, and release Agm to periplasm. These theoretical analyses of AdiC are partly consistent with the previous studies, 13,14 but some mechanisms revealed in this article still need to be further confirmed by the experimental data of X-ray crystallography.

From Soup: 60 The theoretical studies of AdiC obtained by coarse-grained methods are fairly consistent with the experimental data. However, some factors, such as metal ions and water molecules, are not analyzed in this work, which may have very important influences on the protein-ligand recognitions. Fortunately, in the crystal structures of AdiC, there are no metal ions and water molecules on the binding interface, so the coarse-grained approximation is suitable for the protein systems to some extent. Moreover, in recent years, coarse-grained methods have been extensively applied to membrane proteins to explore the global functional motions and mechanisms. 20,21,42 Previous studies have confirmed that these global characteristics are defined by the entire structure and insensitive to structural and energetic details. 21,42 Nevertheless, analyzing the function of metal ions and water molecules may obtain other interesting results. By using molecular dynamics and quantum chemical calculations, the elaborate effect of metal ions and water molecules can be considered in simulations. We will proceed to these studies in the next work.

From Soup: 61 In this work, the simple coarse-grained methods were used to investigate the mechanism of AdiC. By using the GNM, it is found that the homodimer structure is necessary for the function of AdiC. In the substrate-free form, the extracellular domain, including TM2 and TM6 has the trend of dramatic conformational changes. In particular, the largest fluctuation requirement is located on TM6a. From ANM and cross-correlation analysis, we further ascertained the direction of motion and explained the close and open mechanisms of the three gates in AdiC. Our analyses indicate that the conformational motions are encoded in the structure and even the subsequent transitions can be predicted from the existing structures. In particular, docking studies directly proved the existence of two substrate-binding sites and explained their substrate-binding preferences. Then, the questions proposed in the front of this article are well answered here. Furthermore, the recognition and transport knowledge of AdiC revealed in this work can provide some insights into the mechanism studies of the APC superfamily and other transport proteins.
