From cou.: 1 This paper presents a process model for the polygeneration of Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG), power and heat by catalytic hydrothermal gasification of biomass and biomass wastes in supercritical water. Following a systematic process design methodology, thermodynamic property models and thermo-economic process models for hydrolysis, salt separation, gasification and the separation of CH4, CO2, H2 and H2O at high pressure are developed and validated with experimental data. Different strategies for an integrated separation of the crude product, heat supply and energy recovery are elaborated and assembled in a general superstructure. The influence of the process design on the performance is discussed for some representative scenarios that highlight the key aspects of the design. Based on this work, a thermo-economic optimisation will allow for determining the most promising options for the polygeneration of fuel and power depending on the available technology, catalyst lifetime, substrate type and plant scale.

From cou.: 2 Conventional biomass conversion technologies for the production of fuel and power require relatively dry and clean feedstock and thus suffer from increasing competition for a relatively scarce resource. Hydrothermal gasification of biomass in supercritical water is a promising process alternative to produce synthetic natural gas (SNG) since it relaxes this requirement and grants access to a large range of low quality feedstocks such as wet lignocellulosic biomass and biomass wastes that are difficult to valorise by other means and thus relatively cheap.

From cou.: 3 In general, hydrothermal gasification is considered for the production of methane, hydrogen or combinations of these. Matsumura et al.,1 Kruse,2,3 Elliott4 and Peterson et al.5 provide reviews on process fundamentals, chemistry, catalysis and principal technological developments and issues. Experimentally, Vogel et al.6,7 have demonstrated the production of methane from milled wood substrate in a batch reactor. During the subsequent development of a continuous process setup, the required salt separation at supercritical conditions has emerged as a main technological bottleneck. To understand this complex process step, Peterson et al.8,9 have performed visualisations of salt precipitation in a vertical tubular vessel, and Schubert et al.10,11 have conducted an extensive experimental study on the separation of different types of salt from supercritical water. Luterbacher et al.12 have reported an overall process model and provided a first investigation of the process design and life cycle assessment for the hydrothermal production of SNG from wood and manure. Recently, the integration of hydrothermal gasification in fuel ethanol production and biorefinery systems to valorise black liquor and other residuals has received growing attention.13–15 Moreover, microalgae are considered as a favourable feedstock since their production and gasification in a closed nutrient cycle would decouple energy crop based biofuels from food production.16,17

From cou.: 4 Among these previous studies which either discuss general process principles, present lab and pilot units or focus on detailed experimental investigations, Luterbacher et al.12 have presented the only process design model that quantitatively takes energy integration and heat recovery into account. At the time of their developments, only limited insight into the salt separator design and the product separation was yet available. Energy integration has been performed on a scenario basis without optimisation, and the synergies between the reaction and separation subsystems through process integration have been disregarded.

From cou.: 6 This work follows a previously developed methodology for the conceptual design of thermochemical production of fuels from biomass.20 Similar to a classical design procedure, the analysis of raw material characteristics, product specifications and feasible production pathways allows for identifying suitable technology for the process unit operations and energy recovery that are assembled in a process superstructure. A decomposition-based modelling approach is then adopted to systematically develop candidate flowsheets. First, the thermochemical conversion and the energy requirements of the process units are computed in energy-flow models that are developed in flowsheeting software.21 The combined mass- and energy integration is then performed by mixed integer linear programming (MILP), in which both the material flows defined by the superstructure and the heat cascade—that represents the heat exchanger network—act as constraints.22 Considering waste and intermediate product streams as fuel to supply the required heat, the combined SNG, heat and power production is optimised with respect to operating cost. For the so-determined flowsheet, all the equipment is rated with design heuristics and laboratory and pilot plant data to meet the thermodynamic design target. This allows for evaluating the economics and the thermo-economic optimisation of the process with multi-objective optimisation techniques.

Ė, and Ėq represent electrical power, heat and the exergy of heat. For all hydrocarbon substrates and intermediate macromolecular groups without a strict thermodynamic definition of their enthalpy of formation and entropy, Δh0and Δk0 are thereby determined with the correlations of Boie23 and Szargut and Styrylska.24 The superscripts − and + refer to produced and consumed services, respectively. In eqn (4) and (5), only the positive value of Ė occurs either in the numerator or denominator, while eqn (2) and (6) assess net electricity consumption by a negative value of Ė−. The production of heat is only useful if it is provided at a sufficient temperature level to be used locally and is considered zero otherwise.

From cou.: 9 The overall energy and exergy indicatorsε and η provide a strictly physical measure of the energy conversion and its quality degradation. Yet, they do not satisfactorily assess the value of the products with respect to the efficiency of their further conversion into final energy services and competing technologies.14 The technical value of the cogeneration products are therefore assessed in terms of the fuel-equivalent efficiency εchem, in which the net electricity balance is substituted by the equivalent amount of (synthetic) natural gas that is consumed or saved in reference technology. Aiming at a consistent weighting with efficient state-of-the-art technology, electricity is represented by a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC), and heat by electricity-driven heat pumps (HP), both with an exergy efficiency of ηNGCC = ηHP = 55%. This corresponds to an energy efficiency of εNGCC = 57% and performance coefficients of 3.1 and 1.6 for electricity- and gas driven heat pumps in a district heating network with supply and return temperatures of 110 and 70 °C, respectively. From an energy systems perspective, this substitution is legitimate and leads to a consistent and technologically reasonable appraisal of the different energy vectors.25

 ###### 
From cou.: 12 Technically, the conversion requires a heterogeneous catalyst and is thus impossible to perform directly with the solid biomass feed since the big macromolecules cannot access the active sites on the catalyst. The most envisaged route is thus to first decompose the solid feedstock by conventional gasification and then catalytically synthesise the obtained H2/CO-rich gas into CH4 and CO2.18 The conversion of eqn (7) therefore splits up in an endothermal gasification step at high temperature (typically above 800 °C) and an exothermal synthesis step at 300–400 °C at which CH4 is thermodynamically favoured. This limits the product yield since a considerable part of the energy content of the feed is required to form intermediate H2/CO and is then converted into excess heat in its highly exothermal methanation.27

 ###### 
From cou.: 13 Contrary to this two-step layout, the hydrothermal route omits the endothermal step at high temperature and targets a direct conversion of diluted biomass at 300–400 °C into CH4 and CO2. Instead of forming an intermediate gas, the biomass is hydrolysed and gasified in a supercritical aqueous environment at around 300 bar, which allows for an efficient contact with the catalyst.7 The fluid processing thereby requires a feed in the form of a pumpable slurry with typical total solid contents of 20–50 wt% depending on the type of substrate.6,7 Although this makes the process suitable for wet biomass since the heat requirement up to the gasification temperature is reduced by the high pressure and drying is not required, the design must take care of the high amount of water that accompanies the reacting species throughout the process. As this represents the major share of the heat transfer requirements, the overall performance gets sensitive to the energy integration of the plant.

From cou.: 14 Depending on the moisture and type of biomass that is processed, the first step in the conceptual process flow diagram of Fig. 1 is to control its pumpability by mechanical dewatering and/or grinding and diluting the feed. The slurry is then compressed to around 300 bar and heated close to critical conditions at 350–380 °C. During this step, the biomass is hydrolysed into smaller molecules that can access to catalytic sites.7 When being heated above the pseudo-critical point†, the fluid density decreases significantly, and with it the solubility of inorganics that are present in the feedstock. They will thus precipitate as salts and risk to plug the equipment and deactivate the catalyst if they are not efficiently removed. To do so, the subcritical slurry is injected through a dip-tube into a heated vessel to reach supercritical conditions, at which the precipitating salts are separated by gravitation in an equipment similar to a cyclone. The main flow reverses and leaves the vessel at the top.8–11 The supercritical hydrolysate then passes through a fixed bed of a nickel- or ruthenium-based catalyst, which converts, at ideal conditions, more than 99.9% of the organic matter into a near-equilibrium mixture of CH4, CO2, some H2 and only traces of CO.6 If the temperature risks to drop significantly below 400 °C due to the endothermic reactions, preheating of the feed or an external heating of the reactor tubes is thereby required.

From cou.: 15 In order to inject the produced methane at the required purity of 96 mol% into the natural gas grid,28 it must be separated from water, carbon dioxide and possibly hydrogen. For a typical lignocellulosic feedstock of eqn (7) diluted to 20 wt% total solids, the crude product thereby contains approximately 84 mol% of H2O and 8 mol% of each CH4 and CO2 in a supercritical mixture at 300–400 °C and around 300 bar. The design of the product separation should yet not only consider the grid quality specifications for SNG, but also the recovery of the exergy potential of the crude gas and the supply of required heat for the plant. For a similar separation problem in conventional SNG production, the tight integration of the reactive and separation systems have generated process intensification effects that can also be expected for a hydrothermal plant.29

From cou.: 16 Due to the targeted biomass conversion in supercritical water, the process design is confronted with rather particular thermodynamic conditions. With the bulk substance H2O present at reduced pressures pr = p/pc up to 1.4 and temperatures Tr = T/Tc in the range of 0.5 to 1.1, the operations are carried out in very different regions of the phase diagram. In hydrolysis, a suspended organic solid is decomposed at subcritical temperature into a large range of organic compounds. The mixture is then heated above the pseudo-critial point, where the inorganic fraction precipitates and needs to be removed in the salt separator. Gasification is carried out at supercritical conditions, and the crude product expanded and separated somewhere in the gas- and two-phase regions at different compositions.

From cou.: 17 In order to ensure a reliable process design, several requirements are to be met by the thermodynamic model. The bulk of the accompanying water causes the enthalpy-temperature profiles of the hot and cold streams to be non-linear and very tight. A change in temperature of a few degrees may considerably disturb the pinch point and thus the performance of the process. The prediction of these profiles must therefore be valid and consistent over the entire range of the process operating conditions. A second critical requirement is the accurate evaluation of the vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) in the bulk separation, which needs to be able to reproduce the considerable non-idealities due to the polarity of H2O and the fact that the conditions in the separation may approach the critical point of CO2 at 31 °C and 74 bar. Finally, the process design methodology imposes a thermodynamic model that is computationally robust in order to evaluate the process model at very different conditions during the optimisation.

From cou.: 18 Although simple linear models like Henry's law are very convenient at low pressures, they fail at higher pressures where the assumption of infinite dilution does not hold anymore. Approaches based on a general equation of state (EOS), as for example the classic ones by Peng and Robinson30 or Lee and Kesler,31 are better suited for the high pressure domain, but lack accuracy for VLE equilibria in the present mixture. Peng-Robinson is a Van der Waals type EOS and thus suitable to represent moderate non-idealities, but has poor accuracy for polar mixtures. The Lee-Kesler EOS is reasonable for general purposes, but not accurate enough to represent the phase equilibrium of the H2O–CO2-CH4 system. For this reason, Duan et al.32,33 have developed and parametrised a modified form of the Lee-Kesler equation with experimental pVT and binary solvus data over a very large temperature and pressure range (0(50)–1000 °C, 0–8000(1000) bar). Although promising for our application, the evaluation of this equation at the prevailing process conditions has revealed some major weaknesses that prevent its direct application.

From cou.: 19 A hybrid approach has finally proved suitable.14 Above 250 °C, the homogeneous EOS of Duan et al.,32,33 generalised by Esser and Heyen34 to more compounds than the ternary H2O–CO2–CH4 mixture, proves valid for VLE calculations and assures coherency in the critical zone. Below 250 °C, however, the EOS looses both accuracy and robustness and a heterogeneous solubility model is used instead. For this purpose, we have extended the binary models for the H2O–CO2 and H2O–CH4 systems proposed by Duan and Sun35 and Duan and Mao36 to the ternary mixture by regressing activity coefficients that account for the interactions between CO2 and CH4 that have recently been reported in the ternary data of Qin et al.37 With this correction, the ternary model reaches the precision of the binary model.14 Throughout the process, enthalpy is consistently evaluated with the original Lee-Kesler equation since the Duan EOS shows severe deviations from reliable data for pure water.

From cou.: 20 The breakdown of lignocellulosic biomass into its macromolecular components cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin and their hydrolysis into a wide spectrum of smaller molecules follows multiple complex reaction paths that are impractical to detail in a conceptual process design model. In a liquefaction experiment at 303 °C and 122 bar in water and the presence of a nickel catalyst, Waldner and Vogel7 have identified the main intermediate species in the decomposition and developed a simplified reaction network. In the model of Luterbatcher et al.,12 these findings have been used to adjust an approximate hydrolysate composition based on a few model species for wood and manure. They have thereby followed a procedure by hand, which is not generalisable since the decomposition into model species is underdetermined and even infeasible for certain potentially interesting substrates.

From cou.: 36 The currently envisaged design of the salt separator of Fig. 3 consists in a vertical, tubular vessel in which the hydrolysate is injected through a dip tube.8–11 By externally heating the vessel, the mixture passes its pseudo-critical point, at which the solubility of the salts decreases and causes them to precipitate in a salt brine that is withdrawn at the vessel bottom. As the fluid temperature increases, the bulk flow reverses and leaves the vessel at the top. In their model, Luterbacher et al.12 have not considered the detailed equipment design of the salt separator and assumed a linear hT-profile from inlet to outlet to represent the heat exchange requirement with a minimum approach temperature contribution ΔTmin/2 of only 4 °C. From an engineering perspective, this is most likely a too optimistic assumption for the heat transfer at the technological bottleneck and pinch point of the process, and a better definition of the heat transfer requirement that guarantees the feasibility of the heat exchanger design is needed.

From Soup: 78 Originally demonstrated in a batch reactor, the ongoing development of a continuous process envisages a downflow fixed bed design for the slightly endothermal gasification reaction. 6,10,40 The experimental results indicate that equilibrium conversion to CH 4 , CO 2 , residual H 2 and traces of CO can be reached with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of no more than 2 kg biomass , daf kg −1 cat h −1 for gasification temperatures around 400 °C. If the temperature drop due to the endothermicity is too high, heating the feed after the salt separator or external heating of the reactor tubes might be envisaged to assure a good conversion. Catalyst deactivation is estimated assuming that 1 mol of sulfur poisons 1 mol of ruthenium, which is dispersed on the support to 100% and represents c Ru , cat = 2 wt% of the total dry catalyst mass. 10 Accordingly, the catalyst replacement rate ṁ cat [kg s −1 ] is calculated as: in which the first fraction represents the salt concentration [mol kg −1 ] of eqn (20) , Ru the molecular weight of ruthenium [kg mol −1 ] and ṁ ss , out the flowrate [kg s −1 ] of the substrate.

From cou.: 79 T
From Soup: 79 With the typical feed composition of eqn (7) diluted to 20 wt% total solids, the crude product from gasification contains more than 80 mol% H 2 O , approximately equal amounts of CH 4 and CO 2 and some marginal H 2 and CO. Due to the supercritical conditions, its upgrade and expansion to grid conditions potentially allows for recovering mechanical energy, which however competes with the supply of thermal energy required for hydrolysis and salt separation. Another important aspect of the separation system design is the quality of the depleted stream, which may be used to supply the required heat and thus relax the need for a high level of methane recovery in the separation. The given boundary conditions thereby suggest two different separation strategies. Apart from conventional absorptive separation at grid pressure with a dedicated physical solvent followed by a membrane stage to remove residual hydrogen, 18 the better solubility of CO 2 compared to CH 4 in water may become technically relevant at the prevailing process pressure. As shown by the absolute and relative solubilities of CO 2 towards CH 4 in their binary mixtures with water depicted in Fig. 4(a) , the relative solubility deteriorates with increasing pressure, and a trade-off between selectivity and absolute solubility might occur. In any case, the separation is best at low temperature, and additional water is required for absorbing the amount of CO 2 required to reach grid quality natural gas. The expected separation performance for a typical crude composition as calculated with the developed thermodynamic model is shown in Fig. 4(b) . Compared to a simple flash stage where only a marginal separation occurs, several equilibrium stages and additional water allows for purifying the crude product up to the required 96 mol% methane. The increase in purity is thereby rather steep at low rates of additional water , but flattens out at higher rates, which has a considerable impact on the pumping power required to attain high purity. As expected from the trade-off observed in Fig. 4(a) , decreasing the absolute pressure increases the methane recovery due to the change in relative solubility and only marginally affects the attained purity.

From cou.: 80 ss
From Soup: 80 In order to recover mechanical energy from the crude product at high pressure, the separated vapour phase—or the entire supercritical bulk phase, if no high pressure separation is applied—may be expanded through turbines. It might thereby be advantageous or even necessary to preheat the stream, which increases the thermal efficiency of the mechanical power recovery and prevents an expansion too far into the two-phase region. Compared to an adiabatic expansion through valves, this causes less heat to be available from the crude product stream since energy is withdrawn at high temperature, and can lead to suboptimality if done above the process pinch. For the liquid phase obtained from the separation at high pressure, power can be recovered by liquid expanders. This technology is currently being commercialised in natural gas liquefaction plants, where it also copes with expansions that partially result in a vapour phase. 41 As an alternative, the liquid phase could also be reheated and expanded into the vapour domain, which would allow for extracting more mechanical energy from the available potential, but also requires a considerable amount of heat to be supplied.
 ###### 
From cou.: 81 out
From Soup: 81 A general superstructure with all these options for integrated product separation, heat supply and mechanical energy recovery is outlined in Fig. 5 . If the product is not upgraded to grid quality at high pressure, the vapour-liquid (VL) and gas separations need to be carried out after the expansion of the crude product. In this case, the same technologies and models as for the more conventional SNG production by methanation of producer gas can be applied. 18 For bulk gas separation at grid pressure, a Selexol column seems appropriate. The combination of both high pressure and grid pressure separation is also conceivable. In order to reduce the amount of required additional water and thus pump power, the gas could only be pre-separated at high pressure and a single polymeric membrane stage at grid pressure could be used. For a good separation performance of the latter, the partial pressure of CO 2 in the membrane feed should however not exceed 10–20 bar to avoid a decrease in selectivity due to plasticisation. 42

From cou.: 82 10,11
From Soup: 82 As detailed in the methodology, the energy integration of the process is based on the heat cascade formulation in which all process heat requirements are represented by their temperature-enthalpy profiles that are corrected by minimum approach temperatures for a feasible heat exchange. This allows for determining the minimum energy requirement (MER) of the conversion process, from which appropriate technologies for the heat supply and mechanical energy recovery can be chosen. By considering the depleted and intermediate product streams as fuels for this purpose, the combined production of SNG, heat and power is then maximised by MILP, in which the material flows defined by the superstructure and the heat cascade act as constraints. 22

From Soup: 83 Fig. 6 shows the minimum energy requirements of the principal flowsheeting options for wood at the default operating conditions of Table 3 . The composite curves that identify the contributions of the process sections ( Fig. 6(a) ) highlight that the layout of the product separation and expansion section determines the pinch point and influences the energy demand markedly. If no power recovery from the crude product is performed ( Fig. 6 , left), the process pinch is situated at the salt separator and the MER is heavily dependent on the temperature to be reached. If 480 °C are required for a good precipitation of the diluted salts, the MER amounts to 274 kW MW −1 biomass at 480 °C. If a maximum temperature of 430 °C in the separator is yet sufficient, only 193 kW MW −1 biomass are needed at the pinch (418 °C). Below, the specific and latent heat of the crude product is sufficient for preheating and hydrolysis of the feed, and an excess of 150–250 kW MW −1 biomass can be recovered between 250 and 400 °C ( Fig. 6(b) ). Limited power recovery by liquid expansion of the high pressure condensate and/or expansion of the incondensable mixture with previous reheating to the process pinch does not change the MER and only marginally influences the amount of excess heat (not shown on figures).

From Soup: 84 If no separation at high pressure is applied and the crude product including the bulk water vapour is expanded in a turbine, the energy withdrawn as mechanical work is not available anymore at the gasification outlet temperature. As a consequence, the pinch point potentially shifts to the turbine outlet temperature and results in an increased MER at lower temperature ( Fig. 6 , right). Reheating the crude might thereby be required to avoid condensation in the final turbine stages and enhances the thermodynamic conversion efficiency, which leads not only to an increased power output but also heat demand.

From Soup: 85 If the condensable phase from separation at high pressure is evaporated, reheated and expanded to atmospheric pressure, the characteristics of the process integration change drastically. For such a configuration, the pinch point shifts to the saturation temperature of the mixture at atmospheric pressure and the MER increases to 66–70% of the raw material's heating value. This would require to burn a large part of the produced gas and thus turn the generation of electrical power to the plant's main purpose.

From cou.: 86 A general superstructure with all these options for integrated product separation, heat supply and mechanical energy recovery is outlined in Fig. 5. If the product is not upgraded to grid quality at high pressure, the vapour-liquid (VL) and gas separations need to be carried out after the expansion of the crude product.

From Soup: 86 As mentioned earlier, the residual amount of methane and hydrogen in the depleted streams from the product separation may contribute to satisfy the process MER and reduce the amount of fuel to be withdrawn from the product stream in order to balance the heat demand. In the separation system superstructure of Fig. 5 , the waste streams considered for this purpose are the vapour phase recovered from flash drums at atmospheric pressure, the offgas from the Selexol regeneration column and the membrane permeate in the SNG postprocessing after bulk removal of CO 2 . If these are not sufficient, crude SNG at grid pressure is identified as the appropriate stream to balance the heat requirement.

From Soup: 87 In addition to the embedded power generation from the exergy potential of the high pressure product, excess heat below the pinch can be recovered in a Rankine cycle to cogenerate electricity and industrial heat. In our model, the energy recovery potential of such a cycle is calculated with water as working fluid, although the temperature levels identified in Fig. 6(b) suggest an organic fluid to be technically more relevant. Complementary to conventional waste heat recovery in a bottoming cycle, the pinch at a still moderate temperature level might also allow for high temperature cogeneration. Although gas engines or standard gas turbines are not adequate since the temperature level of the cogenerated heat is too low to efficiently balance the MER, 12 less conventional gas turbine technology might yet be an option. One possibility is thereby not to limit the turbine inlet temperature by lean combustion , but to withdraw high temperature heat by radiative transfer from the combustion to satisfy the MER. Another option is to only partially oxidise the fuel in the gas turbine and complete the combustion after expansion. These options provide substantially more heat than standard gas turbines at the identified process pinch point, and internal heat recovery for air preheating and steam injection might further increase the cogeneration efficiency. 14

From Soup: 88 The investment cost of a conceptual process design is estimated through rating and costing the major process equipment of Fig. 1 that is required to reach the targeted conversion. 20 Following classic process design procedures, 26,43 the process vessels for reaction and separation are roughly sized for the specific operating conditions. Costing data from the same sources is then used to determine the investment required for the plant.
 ###### 
From cou.: 89 If no separation at high pressure is applied and the crude product including the bulk water vapour is expanded in a turbine, the energy withdrawn as mechanical work is not available anymore at the gasification outlet temperature. As a consequence, the pinch point potentially shifts to the turbine outlet temperature and results in an increased MER at lower temperature (Fig. 6, right). Reheating the crude might thereby be required to avoid condensation in the final turbine stages and enhances the thermodynamic conversion efficiency, which leads not only to an increased power output but also heat demand.
From Soup: 89 Before diluting and pressurisation, solid biomass feedstock has to be ground, whereas wet feedstock is dewatered in a sedimentation centrifuge. If sanitarily problematic waste biomass such as manure is used, the excess water is further purified by ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis , which also allows for recovering the nutrient salts and dissolved organic matter. The required membrane area for the unit has been reconciled with the available cost data. 12,43 For the salt separator, the heat transfer area is determined in the energy-flow model and directly used for its costing as a shell-and-tube heat exchanger with a fixed tube sheet in titanium alloy. The gasification reactor is rated for a WHSV of 2 kg biomass , daf kg cat −1 h −1 considering a dry catalyst bed density of 260 kg m −3 . The equipment for VL separation and gas absorption is sized according to design recommendations 43 assuming a tray efficiency of 15%. For CO 2 absorption in water at high pressure, the saturated solvent is simply expanded and flashed at atmospheric pressure to recover the residual fuel . The regeneration of Selexol requires a stripper of approximately equal size than the absorption tower. For the membrane stage, the same cost data as in Gassner and Maréchal 18 is used. The cost of combustion equipment is assessed with a correlation for alloy steel reformer furnaces. 43 For the heat exchanger network, the total heat transfer area and the minimum number of exchangers is estimated from the balanced composite curves following Ahmad et al. 44 The cost of the network is assessed for fixed tube sheet heat exchangers of mixed carbon-steel/nickel-alloy construction at maximum process pressure with the averaged surface areas obtained for a reference heat transfer coefficient of 580 W m −2 K −1 . 14 For all turbomachinery, centrifugal units are considered.

From Soup: 90 The plant's operating costs C op for the conversion of one unit of biomass are calculated considering the expenses for the feedstock C biomass , catalyst C cat , utilities C UT , operating labour C OL and maintenance C M (all in [$ MWh biomass −1 ]): in which C el corresponds to the electricity price, C salaries the employees' total yearly salaries, t a the yearly operating time and C GR the investment (grass roots) cost. In this formulation, the utility cost C UT ( eqn 23 ) cancels out if the plant produces net electricity ( i.e. Ė + = 0, Ė − > 0), the maintenance cost C M is supposed to amount to 5% of the investment per year and the catalyst cost C cat is determined from its replacement rate ṁ cat with respect to the sulfur loading as calculated by eqn (20), (21) .

In our model, the energy recovery potential of such a cycle is calculated with water as working fluid, although the temperature levels identified in Fig. 6(b) suggest an organic fluid to be technically more relevant. Complementary to conventional waste heat recovery in a bottoming cycle, the pinch at a still moderate temperature level might also allow for high temperature cogeneration. Although gas engines or standard gas turbines are not adequate since the temperature level of the cogenerated heat is too low to efficiently balance the MER,12 less conventional gas turbine technology might yet be an option. One possibility is thereby not to limit the turbine inlet temperature by lean combustion, but to withdraw high temperature heat by radiative transfer from the combustion to satisfy the MER. Another option is to only partially oxidise the fuel in the gas turbine and complete the combustion after expansion. These options provide substantially more heat than standard gas turbines at the identified process pinch point, and internal heat recovery for air preheating and steam injection might further increase the cogeneration efficiency.14

From cou.: 93 The investment cost of a conceptual process design is estimated through rating and costing the major process equipment of Fig. 1 that is required to reach the targeted conversion.20 Following classic process design procedures,26,43 the process vessels for reaction and separation are roughly sized for the specific operating conditions. Costing data from the same sources is then used to determine the investment required for the plant.

From cou.: 94 Before diluting and pressurisation, solid biomass feedstock has to be ground, whereas wet feedstock is dewatered in a sedimentation centrifuge. If sanitarily problematic waste biomass such as manure is used, the excess water is further purified by ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis, which also allows for recovering the nutrient salts and dissolved organic matter. The required membrane area for the unit has been reconciled with the available cost data.12,43 For the salt separator, the heat transfer area is determined in the energy-flow model and directly used for its costing as a shell-and-tube heat exchanger with a fixed tube sheet in titanium alloy. The gasification reactor is rated for a WHSV of 2 kgbiomass,dafkgcat−1h−1 considering a dry catalyst bed density of 260 kg m−3. The equipment for VL separation and gas absorption is sized according to design recommendations43 assuming a tray efficiency of 15%. For CO2 absorption in water at high pressure, the saturated solvent is simply expanded and flashed at atmospheric pressure to recover the residual fuel. The regeneration of Selexol requires a stripper of approximately equal size than the absorption tower. For the membrane stage, the same cost data as in Gassner and Maréchal18 is used. The cost of combustion equipment is assessed with a correlation for alloy steel reformer furnaces.43 For the heat exchanger network, the total heat transfer area and the minimum number of exchangers is estimated from the balanced composite curves following Ahmad et al.44 The cost of the network is assessed for fixed tube sheet heat exchangers of mixed carbon-steel/nickel-alloy construction at maximum process pressure with the averaged surface areas obtained for a reference heat transfer coefficient of 580 W m−2 K−1.14 For all turbomachinery, centrifugal units are considered.

From cou.: 95 The plant's operating costs Cop for the conversion of one unit of biomass are calculated considering the expenses for the feedstock Cbiomass, catalystCcat, utilities CUT, operating labour COL and maintenance CM (all in [$ MWhbiomass−1]):in which Cel corresponds to the electricity price, Csalaries the employees' total yearly salaries, ta the yearly operating time and CGR the investment (grass roots) cost. In this formulation, the utility cost CUT (eqn 23) cancels out if the plant produces net electricity (i.e. Ė+ = 0, Ė− > 0), the maintenance cost CM is supposed to amount to 5% of the investment per year and the catalyst cost Ccat is determined from its replacement rate ṁcat with respect to the sulfur loading as calculated by eqn (20), (21).

From Soup: 101 In order to illustrate the thermo-economic performance of the principal flowsheet alternatives and their impact on power cogeneration, Table 5 shows a screening of energy balances, efficiencies and costs for the conversion of wood at a plant scale of 20 MW th , biomass and the operating economic conditions of Table 3 and 4 . The associated conceptual flowsheets are illustrated in Fig. 7 . Comparing the alternatives for product separation with a high pressure stage, the detailed electricity balance highlights the elevated pump power required for complete separation in a water scrubber column at 300 bar. Power recovery through liquid expanders thus appears mandatory. From an efficiency point of view, bulk gas separation at grid pressure is still more competitive due to its lower power consumption. For both these options, the power recovery potential from expanding the vapour phase to grid pressure is relatively modest and only feasible at large production scales. 14 With bulk separation at high pressure, a Rankine cycle may generate 6–8% of the biomass input as electricity and allows for a positive net power balance. Due to the high marginal electric efficiency approaching 60%, the use of a partial oxidation turbine for high-temperature cogeneration might slightly increase the chemical efficiency-equivalent although the power potential is limited. If no separation at high pressure is applied and the entire crude product is reheated, expanded and separated at grid pressure, the product balance shifts towards an increased electricity generation to the expense of SNG. Both the product expansion turbine and the bottoming cycle generate substantially more power and integrate particularly well with a partial oxidation turbine. For all options, a substantial amount of energy is lost in form of the chemical potential of the substrate accompanying the salt brine withdrawn from the separator. The largest part of the energy loss is yet related to the heat evacuation by cold utility. If industrial heat can be used locally, increasing the condensation level of the Rankine cycle to 120 °C for cogenerating heat in a distribution network at 110 °C (70 °C return) would eliminate the major part of this loss and increase the total energy efficiency ε to 77.1%, 77.7% and 81.2% for the three cases of Table 5 without partial oxidation turbines ( i.e. VL and gas separation at high pressure, VL separation at high pressure and gas separation at grid pressure, and VL and gas separation at grid pressure, respectively). By recovering 19–28% of the biomass input as heat to the expense of a net decrease of the electricity yield by 3.0–4.6%, an equivalent coefficient of performance greater than 6 is thereby attained for the marginal substition of electricity by heat. Assuming a reference energy efficiency of ε HP = 55% in the definition of ε chem ( eqn (6) ) for this conversion by heat pumping, 14 the polygeneration of fuel , heat and power allows for increasing the chemical efficiency of the configurations of Table 5 by 6–8 points.

From Soup: 102 The economic comparison assesses investment costs around 1000 $ kW biomass −1 that increase with the share of cogenerated electricity. The total costs are dominated by the expenses for wood and would be considerably lowered if waste biomass was used. For the relatively small plant capacity reported here, the capital depreciation represents 17–20% of the total cost considering an interest rate of 6%. If the capital investment would be recovered at a 1.7 times higher recovery factor that corresponds to i r = 15% and n = 15 years, the total cost would increase by 10–13% and require a similar increase of the revenues from selling SNG and power to maintain the same competitivity with respect to biomass break even cost. Depending on the process configuration, electricity cogeneration may thereby generate a considerable share of the total revenue, which makes the economically optimal plant design heavily dependent on the prevailing relative selling prices for renewable SNG and electricity. For the plant operation, the cost for catalyst replacement is important and severely limits the process efficiency. Other means than preventing catalyst deactivation by a high temperature in the salt separator to limit the dissolved sulfur content or an economic way for catalyst regeneration would thus be worthwhile. As outlined in Section 5.1, a temperature reduction of 50 °C in the salt separator decreases the MER by 30% and would thus allow for a higher product yield since less fuel needs to be withdrawn for heat supply.

From Soup: 103 Table 6 compares the projected process efficiency of hydrothermal gasification with the major competing routes for the polygeneration of fuels , power and heat from lignocellulosic biomass. These data have been obtained using a similar methodology based on the same assumptions and level of detail. Even at an initial moisture content of 50%, the conversion in supercritical water outperforms the fermentation of ethanol 45 and the thermochemical production of liquid fuels 46 , and is on a par with the one of SNG by conventional biomass gasification and methanation. However, processing biomass at 80% instead of 50% moisture with conventional technology would require to evaporate an additional amount of 3 kg of water per kg of dry matter, whose total enthalpy of vaporisation corresponds to 39% of the biomass' lower heating value. Even if done in multiple effects, this represents a severe energy penalty and demonstrates the advantage of the hydrothermal route for wet substrates.

For this purpose, thermo-economic models for promising candidate technologies have been developed, reconciled and validated with data from experimental investigations and process demonstration. A general superstructure for combined product separation and internal energy recovery from the supercritical conditions has been established to explore the possibilities for an efficient cogeneration of SNG and power. Simultaneously considering the mass and energy balances in the process integration thereby allows for linking the synthesis of the separation and energy recovery systems while considering the depleted streams as fuels to balance the heat demand of the process.
