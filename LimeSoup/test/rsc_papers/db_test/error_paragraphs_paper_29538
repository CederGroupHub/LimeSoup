From cou.: 1 Relatively little is known about structural transformations of very small metal clusters that result from the adsorption of molecules. Here, the ligand-induced structural transformation of Ag5+(g) by 1,4-cyclohexadiene, which is capable of binding metal clusters as a bidentate ligand, is investigated using equilibrium mass spectrometry experiments and theory. Based on the measured sequential ligand binding free energies of Agn+(cyclohexene)m and Agn+(1,4-cyclohexadiene)m (n = 3 and 5; m up to 3), it is found that Ag5+(1,4-cyclohexadiene) is a particularly stable cluster relative to the other ion-molecule association complexes investigated. These results together with those from electronic structure calculations suggest that upon addition of 1,4-cyclohexadiene to Ag5+, the metal cluster core undergoes a structural transformation from a “bowtie” structure(s), in which two Ag2 units are bridged side-on by a central Ag atom, into a bidentate Ag5+(1,4-cyclohexadiene) structure that resembles a “razorback” arrangement of the five Ag atoms. These results raise the prospect of using multidentate ligands to transform larger ionic silver clusters from relatively compact 3D geometries into 2D elongated “razorback” nanowires. However, results from electronic structure calculations for clusters in which the razorback nanowire structural motif is propagated to larger sizes (up to Ag9+) indicate that the energy required to form such templated structures becomes increasingly unfavourable with increasing size. By calculating the vertical and adiabatic ligand binding energies, the competing effects that contribute to the energy required to form such structures, such as the metal cluster reorganization energy, can be quantified. These results indicate that the tendency for metal clusters to form compact shapes dominates other effects that contribute to the energy for forming templated nanowire structures, and this effect dramatically increases with increasing cluster size.

From cou.: 2 Small clusters of metal atoms have long been used to facilitate important catalytic processes for the efficient and economical industrial production of chemicals.1 Of particular interest is the ability to tune the physical properties of clusters by changing the cluster size, shape, and/or composition in order to design “nanomaterials” with desirable catalytic or other properties.2 However, understanding the fundamental details of processes involving metal clusters at the molecular level remains challenging. One approach to examine the properties of metal clusters is to study ionic metal clusters in the “pristine” gas-phase where the effects of cluster-size, composition, charge, solvent and counter-ions can be either carefully controlled or eliminated. Largely as a result, there has been extensive interest in investigating the gas-phase chemistry of ionic metal clusters as models for the chemical processes which occur on the surfaces of metals and metal nanoparticles in the condensed phase.3

From cou.: 3 Although, considerable effort has gone into investigating the size-dependent properties of ionic metal clusters in the gas-phase, significantly less information is known about how the shapes of such clusters can be modified through ligand binding in ion–molecule association reactions. Most work to date has centred around the binding of monodentate ligands. For example, Bowers and co-workers reported that the sequential addition of three ethylene or propylene ligands drives a transformation in the structure of Ag5+ from a D2d “twisted bowtie” structure for isolated Ag5+ to a trigonal bipyramidal structure (D3h) for the metal core of Ag5+L3, where L = C2H4 or C3H6 (Scheme 1),4 based on results from equilibrium mass spectrometry experiments and electronic structure calculations. In equilibrium mass spectrometry experiments, sequential ligand binding enthalpies and entropies can be obtained by measuring the equilibrium constants for the sequential attachment of ligands to size-selected ions as a function of temperature.5 By comparing the strength of sequential alkene ligation to results from electronic structure calculations, structural information about the metal clusters can be obtained.4 Only a limited number of other examples of ligand-induced ionic metal cluster isomerization have been reported, in which the ligands are small monodentate diatomic molecules.6 For example, Popolan et al. measured the sequential binding energies of CO molecules onto mixed silver and gold monocations containing five atoms (AgxAuy+, where x + y = 5) using equilibrium mass spectrometry and compared these results to those obtained using ab initio calculations.6a These results indicated that the mixed Ag/Au metal atom cluster cations containing five atoms undergo structural isomerizations that depend on both the composition of the cluster and on the number of CO molecules that are adsorbed on the ionic metal clusters. Photoelectron spectroscopy has been used to examine the structural changes in the gold CO cluster anions, Aux−(CO)y (where x = 6 and y = 4–96d and x = 7 and y = 1–46e). Finally, while the bidentate bisphosphine ligands, Ph2P(CH2)nPPh2, are known to stabilize small gold cluster cations in solution,7 only recently have DFT calculations be used to examine how these ligands induce structural changes to the bare gold clusters.7g

From cou.: 4 Whereas studies investigating ligand-induced structural changes of metal ion clusters in the gas-phase appear to be relatively rare, “templating surfactants and molecules” are used extensively in the condensed-phase to mediate the synthesis of nanoparticles that exhibit interesting shapes and physical properties.8 Thus, we were interested in investigating the potential of using rigid multidentate ligands to pattern metal cluster ions into novel structures and to better understand the fundamentals of metal cluster transformations induced by ligation. Here, we focus on silver cluster cations and alkenes, because silver readily forms complexes with π donors.4,9 In particular, the cluster structures formed upon the sequential ligation of Ag3+ and Ag5+ by cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene are investigated using multistage mass spectrometry experiments and electronic structure calculations. Particular emphasis is directed to Ag5+, which, based on these results, undergoes a structural change from a bowtie structure in isolation to a unique bidentate structure upon adsorption of 1,4-cyclohexadiene. This structural change suggests that larger multidentate ligands could potentially be used as templates for transforming the structures of larger gas-phase silver cluster ions that have compact 3D geometries into various ligand-patterned structures.

From cou.: 5 All experiments were performed on a Thermo-Finnigan hybrid linear quadrupole ion trap (linear trap quadrupole; LTQ) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer, which was modified to perform ion-molecule reactions,10 and is equipped with a direct infusion electrospray ionization source. Because the LTQ–FT-ICR mass spectrometer is not equipped with a laser ablation ionization source, which are commonly used for generating metal cluster ions, Ag3+ and Ag5+ were generated indirectly by subjecting electrospray generated clusters of N,N-dimethylglycine (D) and Ag, [(D + Ag − H)n−1 + Ag]+, to multiple stages of collision-induced dissociation in the LTQ ion trap.11 In these experiments, even-electron pure silver cluster monocations, Agn+ (where n is an odd number), are generated by collisionally activating [(D + Ag − H)n−1 + Ag]+ which results in the loss of neutral (D − 2H) to form [(n − 2)D + nAg − (n − 3)H]+ (eqn (1)). Isolation and CID of the latter ion results in the loss of D to form [(n − 3)D + nAg − (n − 3)H]+ (eqn (2)). For n = 3, this sequence of two tandem MS experiments results in the formation of [(3 − 3)D + 3Ag − (3 − 3)H]+ = Ag3+ (eqn (1) and (2)). Subjecting isolated [(n − 3)D + nAg − (n − 3)H]+ (for odd n greater than 3) to two additional tandem MS stages, in which (D − 2H) and D are lost in subsequent stages, results in the generation of [(n − 5)D + nAg − (n − 5)H]+, which for n = 5 yields Ag5+ (eqn (1)–(4)). Forming even larger pure silver clusters using this approach becomes increasingly challenging because larger precursor clusters, [(D + Ag − H)n + Ag]+, tend to be formed in lower abundance than the smaller clusters and the number of stages of CID required to generate the pure silver clusters increases linearly with increasing cluster sizes. Pure Agn+ clusters that have an even number of atoms and that correspond to odd-electron ions are not formed in these experiments, which is consistent with the “Even-Electron Rule.”12

From cou.: 6 [(D + Ag − H)n−1 + Ag]+ precursor ions were generated viaelectrospray ionization from a 50:50:1 water–methanol–acetic acid solution containing ∼1 mM D and ∼0.3 mM AgNO3 by applying a potential of 4–5 kV to the ESI capillary relative to the heated capillary entrance of the mass spectrometer (∼150–200 °C). The solution was introduced into the ESI capillary at a rate of ∼3 uL min−1 using a syringe pump. CID experiments were performed using standard procedures in which ions of interest were isolated with an isolation window of between 1.1 and 15 m/z, depending on the isotope distribution desired, that is centered on the m/z value of the most abundant peak of the isotopic envelope. A relative collision energy of 25% was applied for ∼30 ms with a Q-activation value of 0.25.

From cou.: 7 For ion-molecule reactions, a liquid cyclohexene or 1,4 cyclohexadiene is injected at flow rate of 1–5 uL min−1 directly into the helium line that supplies helium to the linear ion trap. The helium pressure regulator that controls the flow of helium into the ion trap under normal operating conditions is bypassed, and instead, the helium pressure is controlled manually by matching the pressure in the vacuum chamber surrounding the ion trap (7.1 × 10−6 Torr), measured using an ionization gauge, to that under normal operating conditions. The temperature of the neutral injection port and the helium line between the injection port and the helium-line entrance to the vacuum chamber is heated to ∼50 °C to ensure vaporization of the injected neutral molecules. The partial pressure of the neutral molecule in the ion trap was obtained as described previously.10b Ions of interest are isolated and stored in the ion-trap, along with any positively charged products of the ion-molecule reaction, for up to 10 s.

From Soup: 17 Electronic structure and molecular geometry calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 software package. 14 Starting geometries were optimized using density functional theory with the B3LYP hybrid exchange–correlation functional and standard 6-311++G** basis set for C and H atoms. For Ag atoms, a Stuttgart Dresden 10-electron effective core potential with a (8s7p6d)/[6s5p3d] contraction scheme 15 was used. 0 K energies of the optimized molecular structures were calculated using the same level of theory as for the geometry optimization step, and these values include the zero-point energy. Harmonic frequencies were calculated to ensure that the optimized geometries are in a local minimum on the potential energy surface. To investigate the accuracy of this relatively economical computational approach, the sequential binding energies of C 2 H 4 molecules to Ag 3 + (C 2 H 4 ) m (for m = 1–3) and Ag 5 + (C 2 H 4 ) m (for m = 1–5) were calculated and compared to values obtained from both equilibrium mass spectrometry measurements and from a different 4 DFT computational approach (see Electronic Supplementary Information; Tables S1 and S2 † ). 16 The calculated binding enthalpies are an average of 0.2 ± 0.1 eV lower than the experimentally measured values, which is more accurate than those that were calculated using a lower level of theory elsewhere 4b (an average of 0.3 ± 0.2 eV lower). Although, the calculated values are lower than the values obtained from experiment, the general trends in the calculated values as a function of cluster size are similar to those for the experimental values, indicating that this computational approach offers reasonable accuracy for the low computational cost relative to more accurate theoretical methods, such as coupled cluster theory.

From Soup: 18 For each ion-molecule association complex investigated computationally for Ag 3 + and Ag 5 + , an extensive and systematic conformational search was conducted. A large number of molecular starting geometries were manually generated by 1) randomly positioning the ligands about the silver cluster ions, 2) systematically selecting monodentate ( i.e. , in which one alkene functional group is interacting directly with one Ag atom of the cluster) structures by rotating the Ag cluster about the Ag atom in direct contact with the alkene functional group, and 3) for the cyclohexadienes , using chemical intuition to generate bidentate starting structures in which two Ag atoms of the silver cluster are directly interacting with each of the two alkene functional groups in the cylohexadiene ligand . In certain instances, such as for mondentate Ag 3 + L, the angle between the two Ag atoms not interacting with the alkene group were forced to be parallel to the alkene functional group during geometry optimization. The structures resulting from geometry optimization were then re-optimized without constraints in order to potentially find additional molecular geometries that are in minima on the potential energy surface. Ag 5 + has multiple possible competitive and stable local minima structures, each of which were used in generating starting molecular geometries for Ag 5 + L. In addition to the several ways of generating starting structures for cluster ions described above, the various structures of the isolated Ag 5 + core were fixed during geometry optimization while the ligand (s) were allowed to move freely. Structures resulting from the constrained geometry optimization were then subjected to an unconstrained geometry optimization in order to potentially find stable structural isomers in addition to those found using other search methods.

From Soup: 19 To explore the possibility of using multidentate ligands to induce a structural transformation in Ag 5 + , the ion-molecule reactions between Ag n + ( n = 3 and 5) and the bidentate 1,4-cyclohexadiene ligand were compared to those with the monodentate cyclohexene ligand . Representative mass spectra resulting from ion-molecule reactions between Ag cluster cations and 1,4-cylohexene (1,4-cHD) and cyclohexene (cH) are given in Fig. 1 . Isolation and storage of a single isotope of Ag 5 + (538.5 m / z ; 1.1 m / z isolation window) in the presence of 1,4-cyclohexadiene ( P 1,4-cHD ∼ 5.4 × 10 −7 Torr) for 6 s results in the formation of a dominant ion at m / z 618.5 corresponding to the ion-molecule association product Ag 5 + (1,4-cHD) ( Fig. 1a ). Addition of a second 1,4-cyclohexadiene molecule is observed in minor abundance. At longer reaction times of up to 10 s, the distribution remains essentially the same, indicating that the Ag 5 + (1,4-cHD) m (for m = 0–2) clusters and the alkene substrate are in chemical equilibrium. In contrast, up to 3 cyclohexene molecules add to Ag 5 + in 6 s under nearly identical conditions ( Fig. 1b ; P cH ∼ 5.1 × 10 −7 Torr). Also, isolation and storage of Ag 3 + , which is planar by necessity, for 6 s in the presence of 1,4-cHD ( P 1,4-cHD ∼ 5.4 × 10 −7 Torr) results in the addition of up to 3 neutral alkene ligands all in relatively high abundance ( Fig. 1c ). These results indicate that ligation of Ag 5 + by a single 1,4-cyclohexadiene ligand results in an especially stable structure and that further ligation is inhibited.

From cou.: 20 To explore the possibility of using multidentate ligands to induce a structural transformation in Ag5+, the ion-molecule reactions between Agn+ (n = 3 and 5) and the bidentate 1,4-cyclohexadiene ligand were compared to those with the monodentate cyclohexene ligand. Representative mass spectra resulting from ion-molecule reactions between Ag cluster cations and 1,4-cylohexene (1,4-cHD) and cyclohexene (cH) are given in Fig. 1. Isolation and storage of a single isotope of Ag5+ (538.5 m/z; 1.1 m/z isolation window) in the presence of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (P1,4-cHD ∼ 5.4 × 10−7 Torr) for 6 s results in the formation of a dominant ion at m/z 618.5 corresponding to the ion-molecule association product Ag5+(1,4-cHD) (Fig. 1a). Addition of a second 1,4-cyclohexadiene molecule is observed in minor abundance. At longer reaction times of up to 10 s, the distribution remains essentially the same, indicating that the Ag5+(1,4-cHD)m (for m = 0–2) clusters and the alkene substrate are in chemical equilibrium.

Also, isolation and storage of Ag3+, which is planar by necessity, for 6 s in the presence of 1,4-cHD (P1,4-cHD ∼ 5.4 × 10−7 Torr) results in the addition of up to 3 neutral alkene ligands all in relatively high abundance (Fig. 1c). These results indicate that ligation of Ag5+ by a single 1,4-cyclohexadiene ligand results in an especially stable structure and that further ligation is inhibited.
From Soup: 20 From the abundances of the products and the pressure of the neutral reagent under equilibrium conditions, the sequential equilibrium constants and standard sequential binding free energies can be obtained. These values are given for Ag 3 + (1,4-cHD) m , Ag 3 + (cH) m , Ag 5 + (1,4-cHD) m and Ag 5 + (cH) m , in Table 1 , for m up to 3. For Ag 3 + , the free energy values for sequential addition of either cH or 1,4-cHD are roughly the same. For example, addition of cH to Ag 3 + is −55.6 kJ mol −1 whereas the addition of 1,4-cHD is essentially the same (−55.9 kJ mol −1 ). Likewise, the free energy values for the third ligand addition to Ag 3 + are −44.7 kJ mol −1 and −43.2 kJ mol −1 for L = cH and 1,4-cHD, respectively. These results are consistent with each ligand binding the Ag 3 + similarly such that a single alkene group interacts directly with Ag 3 + , as opposed to the dialkene binding Ag 3 + in a bidentate arrangement.

From cou.: 21 From the abundances of the products and the pressure of the neutral reagent under equilibrium conditions, the sequential equilibrium constants and standard sequential binding free energies can be obtained. These values are given for Ag3+(1,4-cHD)m, Ag3+(cH)m, Ag5+(1,4-cHD)m and Ag5+(cH)m, in Table 1, for m up to 3. For Ag3+, the free energy values for sequential addition of either cH or 1,4-cHD are roughly the same. For example, addition of cH to Ag3+ is −55.6 kJ mol−1 whereas the addition of 1,4-cHD is essentially the same (−55.9 kJ mol−1). Likewise, the free energy values for the third ligand addition to Ag3+ are −44.7 kJ mol−1 and −43.2 kJ mol−1 for L = cH and 1,4-cHD, respectively. These results are consistent with each ligand binding the Ag3+ similarly such that a single alkene group interacts directly with Ag3+, as opposed to the dialkene binding Ag3+ in a bidentate arrangement.
From Soup: 21 The binding free energy for Ag 5 + (1,4-cHD) is more negative than for all the clusters investigated by at least 6 kJ mol −1 , including that for Ag 3 + (1,4-cHD) and Ag 3 + (cH), which is significant given the much higher charge density of Ag 3 + vs. Ag 5 + . These results indicate that the formation of Ag 5 + (1,4-cHD) is particularly favorable. Furthermore, the free energy for addition of a second 1,4-cHD molecule to Ag 5 + (1,4-cHD) is one of the least negative values measured and is comparable to the value for adding a third ligand to either Ag 3 + (cH) m or Ag 3 + (1,4-cHD) m . This is in contrast to data for each of the other clusters in which the second ligand addition is nearly the same free energy value as the first ligand addition. These results are consistent with the 1,4-cHD molecule binding Ag 5 + via two direct Ag–alkene interactions (that is, bidentate binding) which hinders the addition of a subsequent 1,4-cHD molecule.

From Soup: 22 Bowers and co-workers measured Δ H and Δ S values for the sequential addition of C 2 H 4 and CH 3 CH CH 2 to Ag n + for n from 3 to 13. 4 Based on the unusually large Δ H and Δ S values, addition of the third alkene ligand was clearly special, resulting from a ligand -induced structural change of the core Ag 5 + . Although we cannot measure sequential Δ H and Δ S ligand binding values without modifying the instrument to enable temperature control, the free energy for the addition of a second and third cH molecule to Ag 5 + (cH) 2 (−51.0 kJ mol −1 ) are comparable to the sequential standard Gibbs free energy values obtained from the sequential Δ H and Δ S values reported by Bowers and coworkers for the second and third addition of CH 3 CH CH 2 to Ag 5 + (C 3 H 6 ) m (49.2 and 51.2 kJ mol −1 , respectively). These results are consistent with a similar structural change of the Ag 5 + core upon addition of the third cH molecule as occurs for the simpler alkene molecules reported by Bowers and co-workers. 4

From Soup: 24 Lowest energy optimized molecular geometries for Ag 3 + (cH) m and Ag 3 + (1,4-cHD) m ( m = 0–3) are shown in Fig. 2 and 3 . The lowest energy calculated structure for Ag 3 + (cH) involves the alkene functional group being directly η 2 (C1,C2) bound, where C1 and C2 are the respective carbons at positions 1 and 2 in the alkene ligand , by one of the Ag atoms of the Ag 3 trigonal planar structure. The lowest energy conformation of Ag 3 + (cH) 2 has two η 2 (C1,C2) bound cH molecules on the two corners of the Ag 3 + triangle. For Ag 3 + (1,4-cHD) m , the single ligand can bind the metal cluster at two Ag positions (bidentate, Fig. 3 ) or at just a single position (monodentate). The structure involving bidentate binding is only ∼5.6 kJ mol −1 lower in energy than that in which the ligand binds in a monodentate fashion for m = 1 and is higher in energy for m = 2, despite having double the number of direct alkene-Ag atom interactions than that of the monodentate structures, indicating that the orientation of the alkene functional groups in the bidentate binding arrangement are not ideal for Ag 3 + . These results are consistent with the molecular description of alkene –Ag n + bonding reported by Bowers and co-workers 4 in which electron-rich and polarizable alkene ligands tend to bind at the “corners” of silver cluster cations where the LUMO of the metal cluster protrudes the furthest into vacuum and can accept significant electron density from the π-bond of the alkene group.

From Soup: 25 Optimized molecular geometries for Ag 5 + are shown in Fig. 4a–c . The two isomers that are calculated to be the lowest in energy ( a and b ) can be considered “bowtie” structures in which two Ag 3 triangles share a common Ag atom and are either planar or twisted by a 90 degree rotation between the two triangles about the central Ag atom. The planar bowtie structure is calculated to be slightly higher in energy than the twisted structure (by 2.1 kJ mol −1 ). The trigonal bipyramidal isomer, which is calculated to be 68.6 kJ mol −1 higher in energy than the lowest energy isomer, contains one Ag atom at each of the five points of a bipyramid with a triangular base shared between the two pyramids. The measured collision cross section of isolated Ag 5 + is most consistent with the calculated cross-sections of the bowtie isomers, 17 indicating that under thermal conditions, Ag 5 + is likely to be one or a combination of isomers related to the bowtie isomers. The three stationary point isomeric geometries of Ag 5 + were used for manually generating starting geometries for subsequent DFT optimization of Ag 5 + (cH) and Ag 5 + (1,4-cHD) in an extensive and systematic conformational search (see Methods section).

From Soup: 28 In Table 2 , the calculated 0 K sequential ligand binding free energies for Ag n + L m ( n = 3, 5; m up to 2) are shown. Although these values are not directly comparable to the measured Gibbs free energy values, they do provide insights into the relative strengths of the respective binding interactions between the silver clusters and the ligands . In addition, the 0 K binding energies calculated using this DFT computational provide reasonable accuracy and reproduce the trends in the 0 K binding energies for Ag n + (C 2 H 4 ) m that are obtained from experimental data (see Calculations section, Electronic Supplementary Information, † and reference 4b ). The calculated 0 K binding enthalpy for the 1,4-cHD ligand to Ag 5 + for the bidentate razorback structure is particularly high (103.9 kJ mol −1 ) when compared to that for either the lowest energy monodentate structure (74.9 kJ mol −1 ) or to the binding energy of cH to Ag 5 + (76.7 kJ mol −1 ; Table 2 ).

From Soup: 31 DFT optimization of the bare Ag 5 + core of the lowest energy Ag 5 + (1,4-cHD) structure, in which the ligand is removed (Isomer d , Fig. 4 ), results in the formation of the lowest energy Ag 5 + twisted bowtie structure (Isomer a , Fig. 4 ). The calculated single-point energy of the isolated razorback Ag 5 + structure (Isomer d , Fig. 4 ) is 17.5 kJ mol −1 higher in energy than the lowest energy twisted bowtie structure, that is, the cluster reorganization energy, λ (Ag 5 + *), for the core Ag 5 + razorback structure to relax to the ground state structure after removal of the ligand is −17.5 kJ mol −1 . This result indicates that the razorback Ag 5 + structure formed via 1,4-cHD ligation is not stable in isolation and the transition from the razorback structure to the bowtie structures is barrier-less when in isolation. Thus, a possible mechanism for the rearrangement of the cluster upon ligation involves monodentate binding of the ligand to a bowtie structure, followed by a twist and bend of the two Ag 3 triangles about the shared Ag atom to form the razorback structure all of which is promoted by the 1,4-cHD ligand .

From Soup: 32 Both the experimental and theoretical results are consistent with the formation of the razorback bidentate structure upon ligation of Ag 5 + by 1,4-cyclohexadiene in the gas-phase. This razorback structure raises the tantalizing possibility of using rigid multidentate ligands as templates to pattern larger ionic metal clusters. For example, in Fig. 7 potential molecular structures for Ag 7 + ( 1,4,5,8-tetrahydronaphthalene ) and Ag 9 + ( 1,4,5,8,9,10-hexahydroanthracene ), in which the razorback structural motif is extended, that are obtained from DFT optimizations are shown. Although these interesting structures are calculated to be in minima on the potential energy surface, the 0 K binding energy of the corresponding multidentate ligand to the razorback nanowire structure for Ag 7 + is calculated to be only 29.1 kJ mol −1 and that for Ag 9 + is −55.3 kJ mol −1 , which indicates that the formation of this latter structure is significantly higher in energy than that of the respective ground state structures of Ag 9 + and the ligand in isolation. There are at least three major effects that should contribute the binding energy values for forming the ligand -bound nanowires shown Fig. 7 . With increasing size, the number of direct interactions between the ligand and the silver cluster ions increases linearly and monotonically with increasing cluster and ligand size, which should contribute to higher binding energy values with increasing cluster sizes. The effect of the number of direct Ag–alkene interactions is offset by (i) the strong tendency of metal atom clusters to favor the formation of close-packed structures, which should become even more favorable upon increasing the number of metal atoms in the cluster; and (ii) the decrease in the charge density of the ionic silver cluster with increasing cluster size, which should also contribute to lower binding energy values with increasing cluster size. It is not straightforward to readily decouple these three effects that should all contribute to the relative stability of these templated nanowires .

From Soup: 33 One strategy to quantify these competing effects is to segment the binding energy (or adiabatic binding energy, ABE, for the purposes of this discussion) into the vertical ligand binding energy (VBE), the cluster reorganization energy, λ (Ag n + *), and the ligand reorganization energy, λ (L*) (see the thermodynamic cycle in Fig. 8 ). The ligand VBE is the energy for removing the ligand from the Ag n + L razorback nanowire cluster without allowing the geometries of the resulting isolated ligand and cluster that are activated (L* and Ag n + *, respectively) to relax, while allowing the electronic structure of L* and Ag n + * to relax. λ (Ag n + *) and λ (L*) are simply the reorganization energy of Ag n + * and L*, respectively, i.e. the difference in the ground state structure and the higher energy structure resulting from vertically removing the ligand from Ag n + L. From the thermodynamic cycle in Fig. 8 , the ABE is given by eqn (8) .

From Soup: 35 The energy values of the various components of the ABE given in eqn (8) , and the ABE, were calculated for the razorback nanowire structures in Fig. 7 , and these values are plotted in Fig. 9 as a function of cluster size. 18 Of the three components of the ABE, the reorganization energy of the silver cluster changes the most dramatically with increasing cluster size. For example, the calculated – λ (Ag n + *) value for Ag 5 + (1,4-cHD) is only 17.5 kJ mol −1 , but increases nearly linearly and monotonically to a value 186.8 kJ mol −1 for Ag 9 + ! 19 In contrast, the VBE remains relatively constant with increasing cluster size (from n = 5 to 9), despite the number of direct interactions between the silver cluster and the ligand increasing linearly with increasing size, presumably because the charge density of the metal core decreases with increasing size and thus, the strength of the individual direct Ag–alkene interactions decreases. The reorganization energy of the ligand is relatively small (< 20 kJ mol −1 ) and does not depend significantly on cluster size, presumably because the ligands are relatively rigid and thus, the structures of these ligands do not change substantially upon binding to the clusters. These results indicate that the unfavorable binding energy values for forming the larger multidentate bound razorback nanowires are a result of the large cluster reorganization energy which increases dramatically with increasing cluster size. These results also suggest that to form such structures, additional stabilization of the nanowires is required or these structures must be formed in such a way that they are kinetically trapped.

From Soup: 36 The sequential ligation of Ag 3 + and Ag 5 + with cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene was examined using equilibrium mass spectrometry experiments and theory. These results suggest that Ag 5 + undergoes a structural isomerization of the metal cluster core upon addition of a 1,4-cyclohexadiene molecule to form a particularly stable ion–molecule association product ion. The lowest energy calculated structure for Ag 5 + ( 1,4-cyclohexadiene ) is a razorback structure ( Fig. 7 , top structure) in which there are two direct alkene –Ag atom interactions between the metal cluster and the ligand . This structural isomerization of the Ag 5 + core is different to that observed upon sequential ligation by monodentate ligands such as alkenes 4 and CO, 5a suggesting an unique templating effect of the 1,4-cyclohexadiene ligand . Perhaps this strategy of templating cluster ions via ion-molecule reactions with rigid multidentate ligands to form interesting metal cluster structures could be used to soft land 20 such synthetically designed structures onto surfaces as a new route to generating novel microfabricated surfaces. Future attempts to form larger templated ionic metal cluster structures will need to overcome the tendency for metal clusters to form compact 3D geometries, which, based on results from electronic structure calculations, is very strong for the 2D nanowires investigated here.

From cou.: 37 The sequential ligation of Ag3+ and Ag5+ with cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene was examined using equilibrium mass spectrometry experiments and theory. These results suggest that Ag5+ undergoes a structural isomerization of the metal cluster core upon addition of a 1,4-cyclohexadiene molecule to form a particularly stable ion–molecule association product ion. The lowest energy calculated structure for Ag5+(1,4-cyclohexadiene) is a razorback structure (Fig. 7, top structure) in which there are two direct alkene–Ag atom interactions between the metal cluster and the ligand. This structural isomerization of the Ag5+ core is different to that observed upon sequential ligation by monodentate ligands such as alkenes4 and CO,5a suggesting an unique templating effect of the 1,4-cyclohexadiene ligand.
