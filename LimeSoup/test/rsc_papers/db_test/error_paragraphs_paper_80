From Soup: 0 Photofunctional proteins, i.e. proteins that elicit or change a physiological function in response to light absorption, have long been recognized as underpinning a plethora of biological functions ranging from vision to plant growth, light sensing and DNA repair. Over the years, a wealth of information has been gained on the structure and function of these proteins. The field has grown mature enough for researchers to begin exploring the applications of this valuable knowledge. The ability to both engineer proteins to suit particular demands and also to express them selectively in a particular cell organelle holds the very appealing potential of being able to genetically encode a light-inducible biological function and thus control it with an unprecedented degree of selectivity. It is unquestionable now that the development of fluorescent proteins has revolutionized the field of molecular biology and in fact this was recognized with the 2008 Nobel Prize awarded to the pioneers in the field Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie and Roger Y. Tsien. The time has come for the field to evolve from using proteins as sensors to applying them as actuators to control a biological function. This themed issue of Photochemical & Photobiological Sciences presents our readers with a number of contributions that superbly exemplify this emerging concept.

From Soup: 1 The first group of papers is devoted to the exciting field of optogenetics, where light-gated proteins originally designed by nature, also known as photoreceptors, are exploited as tools to elegantly photomodulate cell activities. In contrast to fluorescent reporters, light-gated proteins are supposed to perturb processes in optogenetics studies, and do so with exquisite spatiotemporal control, in many cases by means of chimeric proteins. The perspective paper from Möglich and Moffat reviews the state-of-the art and also offers an excellent starting point for beginners with the desire to enter the field. The focus is on engineering strategies – from mutation to truncations – to optimize the dynamic range of application of light-gated proteins, the allosteric control of protein activities and their applicability to solving peculiar cell or even physiological “problems”. The main characters of the plot depicted by Möglich and Moffat are blue-light sensors of the LOV family and the red-light responding phytochromes, but other successful examples are discussed, chiefly the famous protein channelrhodopsin. An example of optimized optogenetics is given by Morgan and Woolley, which can now distinguish, by suitable truncations and mutations, whether a DNA-binding protein fused to photoactive yellow protein increases or decreases its DNA affinity upon light activation. Crucial aspects of naturally-occurring and engineered light-gated proteins are the quantum yield and dynamics of their photocycle. Ito et al. demonstrate that, in a photoswitchable adenylate cyclase, they can be modulated by introducing mutations within the blue-light sensing BLUF domain, an idea suggested to the authors by a naturally occurring variation in the BLUF family.

From Soup: 2 The second group of papers is devoted to fluorescent proteins. They have been long used as genetically encoded markers and sensors. The emerging trend is to develop them into photosensitisers, which might prove useful in, e.g. chromophore-assisted light inactivation (CALI), a well-established tool in structural biology, or for photodynamic therapy applications. The perspective by Lukyanov et al. offers an excellent introduction to the field and provides a privileged insight into the foreseeable trends in the future. Roy et al. in turn show in their very elegant studies the usefulness of molecular dynamics simulations to ascertain the diffusion pathways of dioxygen and the superoxide radical anion within the protein. This topic is examined also using an experimental approach by Jiménez-Banzo et al., who study the production of singlet oxygen by a number of green fluorescent protein mutants with variable degrees of oxygen accessibility to the protein's chromophore.

From Soup: 3 The third perspective in the themed issue is contributed by Abbruzzetti et al., who review the current understanding of the mechanism of photoswitching of green fluorescent protein mutants. This perspective will be most useful to those readers interested in using fluorescent proteins for bioimaging applications, e.g. as markers for high-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques.
