From Soup: 0 This special issue collects ten papers selected from amongst those presented at the First International Congress on Cocoa Coffee and Tea (CoCoTea 2011) held on 13–16 September 2011, in Novara, Italy. It was the first of a series of conferences, supported by EuCheMS Food Chemistry Division, the International Society of Maillard Reaction (IMARS) and SAFE Consortium, particularly focussing on the science of cocoa, chocolate, coffee, tea, and related products. Despite the extent of scientific literature, this field is likely to yield many new discoveries regarding the chemical quality, the technological advances, and the health-related aspects. Ten inter-disciplinary works dealing with different aspects of cocoa, chocolate, coffee and tea (chemistry, technology, nutrition and health) are included in this themed issue.
