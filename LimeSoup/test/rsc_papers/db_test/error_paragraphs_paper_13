From cou.: 1 From October 3–6, 2004 the German Society of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology (DECHEMA) presented the “Green Solvents for Synthesis” meeting in Bruchsal, Germany. The aim of the conference was to highlight innovative concepts for the substitution of volatile organic solvents in solution phase synthesis in academia and industry. The meeting followed the highly successful symposium “Green Solvents for Catalysis” held at the same venue in fall 2002 (see ref. 1). Again, the Green Solvents meeting brought together over 200 scientists from all over the world for fruitful scientific discussions in a stimulating environment. Although it is impossible to reflect the personal contacts and the dynamic atmosphere of such an event on printed paper adequately, the papers summarized in this issue provide a representative overview of the scope and depth of the excellent science presented in the various sessions.

From cou.: 2 Among the many exciting results presented at this meeting, one common theme seemed particularly intriguing: the utilization of novel solution phase concepts offers promising approaches to chemical synthesis that go way beyond simple solvent replacement. Increased reactivities and selectivities can be achieved when the physico-chemical properties of the medium and the molecular nature of the chemical transformation are matched properly. Integration of reaction and separation steps can lead to new reaction engineering concepts that are both environmentally benign and economically attractive. However, it also became clear that our current knowledge is far from sufficient to fully exploit these potential benefits. Consequently, an increasing demand for multidisciplinary efforts, in particular at the interface between molecular science and reaction engineering, has been identified in the discussions at poster sessions, during coffee breaks and while enjoying the conference dinner within the spectacular setting of the Baroque Castle of Bruchsal.

From cou.: 3 As a result, the organising committee together with DECHEMA has decided to continue the “Green Solvents Series” with an international symposium on “Green Solvents for Processes” on October 7–11, 2006. This meeting will be focused exactly on this interface and if you are interested in Green Solvents, you should mark these dates in your calendar immediately. However, don’t book a ticket to Bruchsal yet, because the location will be shifted to Friedrichshafen at the Bodensee, one of the most scenic lakes in Germany.
