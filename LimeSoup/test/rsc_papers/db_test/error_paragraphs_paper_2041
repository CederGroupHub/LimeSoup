From cou.: 1 The relationship between the structure and function of biological networks constitutes a fundamental issue in systems biology. Particularly, the structure of protein–protein interaction networks is related to important biological functions. In this work, we investigated how such a resilience is determined by the large scale features of the respective networks. Four species are taken into account, namely yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, worm Caenorhabditis elegans, fly Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens. We adopted two entropy-related measurements (degree entropy and dynamic entropy) in order to quantify the overall degree of robustness of these networks. We verified that while they exhibit similar structural variations under random node removal, they differ significantly when subjected to intentional attacks (hub removal). As a matter of fact, more complex species tended to exhibit more robust networks. More specifically, we quantified how six important measurements of the networks topology (namely clustering coefficient, average degree of neighbors, average shortest path length, diameter, assortativity coefficient, and slope of the power law degree distribution) correlated with the two entropy measurements. Our results revealed that the fraction of hubs and the average neighbor degree contribute significantly for the resilience of networks. In addition, the topological analysis of the removed hubs indicated that the presence of alternative paths between the proteins connected to hubs tend to reinforce resilience. The performed analysis helps to understand how resilience is underlain in networks and can be applied to the development of protein network models.

From cou.: 2 The study of molecular biology has received much interdisciplinary attention focused on complex interactions in biological systems, which has led to a new perspective, i.e. holism instead of reduction.1Biological processes depend on the interaction between proteins as well as between proteins and other molecules,1 which generate networks of interactions. Though protein–protein interaction networks have been studied for a long time (e.g.ref. 2), only recently graph theoretical concepts and measurements were applied for respective analysis (e.g.ref. 3). Proteins can interact in order to form a cellular complex, where each protein can carry another protein, or interact briefly with a target protein in order to modify it. Protein interaction maps can be naturally represented as networks, where the nodes represent proteins and the edges represent interactions.4

From cou.: 3 One particularly important object of investigation by systems biology researchers has been the relationship between the structure of biological networks and their respective functions that control the information flow and regulation of cellular signals.5,6 Indeed, it has been verified that the structure of protein–protein interaction networks differs from random networks of the type Ërdös and Rényi models,7 but presents a structured organization that follows the scale-free paradigm,8 characterized by the fact that the distribution of the number of connections follows a power law. Actually, the distribution of connections of protein–protein interaction networks follow a power law with a cutoff exponential.9,10 This type of topology is particularly interesting because it accounts for the existence of hubs, i.e. nodes with particularly high degrees, which are known to play an important role in networks.11 As a matter of fact, hubs have an intrinsic relationship with lethality, as verified in recent works (e.g.ref. 9 and 12).

From cou.: 4 The investigation of the relationship between the network organization and function can be performed by gene deletion. In recent experiments, the analysis of robustness of biological networks was performed experimentally by studies in a direct response to gene deletions13 or RNA interference.14 These experiments are fundamental approaches to understanding the global organization of gene functions.13 Computationally, the examination of perturbations can be implemented by random or preferential removal of proteins in protein interaction networks.15 In the former case, all proteins have the same probability to be removed, while in the latter, proteins are selected according to a given attribute, such as the respective number of connections. A previous work analyzed the robustness of proteins of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, where the authors described the variation of network diameter under fails, i.e. random removal, and attacks, achieved by deleting the most connected proteins while following the order of their number of connections.16 However, that work provided only a partial picture of network resilience since it did not provide any explanation about which topological feature is contributing to the network's robustness. In addition, only one particular network property, i.e. the diameter, was analyzed. In fact, since the organization of the networks is a product of natural selection, it is expected that the structure of biological networks of different species should differ in some way. Here, we present a quantification of how several important structural properties contribute for the resilience of protein–protein interaction networks.

From cou.: 5 In order to verify this relationship between resilience and network organization, we performed a comparative analysis of different species calculating the entropy of connectivity distribution17 and the dynamics entropy based on the Markov process,18 which are robustness-related measurements. Particularly, the dynamical entropy for a Markov process was applied recently in the analysis of a protein network of the yeast S. cerevisiae,19 revealing that proteins with large contribution to network entropy are frequently lethal. These adopted measurements proved to be consistent with our performed simulations. The relationship between the structure and function of networks can be quantified in terms of the correlation between these entropy-based measurements and network topological features. In fact, this analysis can reveal which structural property of networks is more determinant for network resilience. We verified that two topological features appear to contribute particularly for this resilience, namely the coefficient of the power law degree distribution and the average neighbor degree. In addition, we verified that the networks of the S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, D. melanogaster and Homo sapiens present similar behavior when subjected to random fails. This result agrees with the experimental observation, where a large number of perturbations did not result in any phenotypic perturbation variation under a given experimental condition.13,14 On the other hand, their networks topologies have a different behavior under intentional attacks. As a matter of fact, the networks of H. sapiens and D. melanogaster revealed to be more robust under intentional attacks than the networks of S. cerevisiae and C. elegans. Therefore, the more complex an organism is, the higher is its resilience to attacks. Since we identified which features are mainly responsible for increased network resilience, these results help to understand the organization and function of protein interactions, and can be applied in the development of more precise protein–protein interaction network models.

From cou.: 7 In order to compare networks of different species, we considered two databases from different sources for each species. This adoption paved the way to a more reliable comparison, since the adopted databases provided networks with different number of proteins and connections (i.e. different levels of completeness). For the yeast S. cerevisiae, we adopted the database of the Center for Cancer Systems Biology (CCSB), which provides high-quality binary interaction information.20 This database is considered a “second-generation” high-quality high-throughput Y2H dataset covering about 20% of all yeast binary interactions.20 This database covers 1809 interactions among 1278 proteins (we name this network as Sce-CCSB). The second database is based on Ito-core and Uetz-screens and is composed by 2930 interactions among 2018 proteins (here named Sce-Union).21 In the case of the worm C. elegans, we took into account two databases: (i) the Worm Interactome,22 from the CCSB (named Cel-Wi), which is composed by 1496 proteins and 1816 interactions (from Vital Lab 2007), and (ii) the worm database by the Biogrid,23 version 3.0.65 (named Cel-BG), composed by 3518 proteins and 6672 interactions. The databases of D. melanogaster were also obtained from the Biogrid,23 version 3.0.65 (named Dme-BG), formed by 7282 nodes and 27671 connections; and from the Drosophila Interaction Database (DroiD), which includes protein interaction data generated in the Finley laboratory using the LexA yeast two-hybrid system, mostly from high throughput screens.24 This latter database resulted in a network (named Dme-FI) composed by 1338 nodes and 3161 interactions. At last, for the H. sapiens, we took into account the database by Biogrid,23 also version 3.0.65 (named Hsa-BG), composed by 9527 proteins and 36877 interactions; and the Human Protein Reference Database release 9,25 formed by 9612 proteins and 39128 interactions (named Has-HPRD). For all these databases, only the largest component was taken into account while performing the resilience analysis.

From cou.: 8 Protein–protein interaction networks are types of undirected complex networks formed by a set of N nodes (or vertices) connected by E edges. A network can be represented by its adjacency matrix A, whose elements aij and aji are equal to one whenever there is a connection between the proteinsi and j, and equal to zero otherwise. The topology of protein–protein interaction networks can be described by a set of network measurements,26 which can quantify the network connectivity, presence of cycles and distances between a pair of nodes.

From cou.: 15 Protein–protein interaction networks present cycles of order three, given by triples of three connected vertices. One way to characterize the presence of loops of this order is through the clustering coefficient. The clustering coefficient cc of a proteini is defined as the number of links li between the nodes within its neighborhood divided by the number of edges that could possibly exist between them (ki(ki − 1)/2).

From cou.: 18 The assortative coefficient, henceforth s, measures the correlation between vertex degrees.28 More specifically, it is obtained by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between the degrees of each pair of nodes. If s > 0 the network is assortative; if s < 0, the network is disassortative; for s = 0 there are no correlations between vertex degrees. While in assortative networks nodes with a similar degree tend to connect to each other, in disassortative structures the highly connected nodes tend to be attached to poorly connected nodes.28

From cou.: 19 The resilience of protein networks can be quantified by entropy related measurements.17,19 The entropy of the degree distribution has revealed to be an effective measure of network's resilience under perturbations.17 This measurement provides an average measure of the network's heterogeneity, since it measures the diversity of the link distribution. The entropy of the degree distribution P(k) can be defined as follows:In the case of protein–protein interaction networks, which present a power-law degree distribution with an exponential cutoff, as the scaling exponent γ increases, the network becomes less heterogeneous and, as a result, a lower entropy value should be observed.

From cou.: 20 The other adopted resilience-related measurement is the dynamic entropy, which is based on stochastic dynamic of random walks. This particular dynamic has been used for modeling of sequential protein activations, such as signal transduction,29 as described in ref. 12. The dynamical entropy of a Markov process characterizes the diversity of possible pathways and is related to the response of the system to perturbations.30 This measurement was used for characterization of proteins in the networks of the yeast, revealing that proteins with large contribution to network entropy are preferentially lethal.19 The dynamical entropy is calculated by the following equation:18

From Soup: 39 The cumulative degree distribution for all protein – protein interaction networks follows a power law with an exponential cut-off, which is due to the finite size effect, 31 described by Fig. 1 shows the cumulative distribution ( P cum ( k ) = ∫ ∞ k P ( x ) dx ) obtained for all eight networks. The values of γ , obtained by using the least squares method, are shown in Table 1 .
 ###### 
From cou.: 40 17,19
From Soup: 40 The clustering coefficient resulted relatively small for all networks, indicating that two connected proteins tend not to share the same set of neighbors. In addition, the small values of the average shortest path length indicate that all considered protein networks are small-world, which can be a consequence of the presence of hubs. It is interesting to note that smaller sp values tended to be obtained for more complex species. In fact, the smaller the shortest path, the faster the communication between nodes, an aspect that can be related to resilience. 32 The diameter of the networks seems to be preserved for all species, varying from 12 to 16. The average neighbor degree also is likely to be higher for more complex species, with the H. sapiens and D. melanogaster presenting the highest values. All investigated protein networks are disassortative, exhibiting smaller coefficient s for the yeast and worm. Similar behavior was observed for the coefficient of the degree distribution. Actually, the protein interaction networks of S. cerevisiae and C. elegans have the lowest degree exponent γ , which means that the topologies of these networks are mostly dominated by the highly connected proteins . In next sections, we verify that this property seems to be fundamental for defining the level of network resilience.

The values of γ, obtained by using the least squares method, are shown in Table 1.
From Soup: 41 We start our dynamic analysis by investigating the effect of random removal of proteins from the networks of the four considered species. This task was achieved without any preferential rule, i.e. all proteins had the same probability to be selected for removal in a network. Fig. 2 presents the variation of the size of the largest component, diameter and average shortest path for each network. These measurements are those most frequently adopted in the literature for analysis of resilience ( e.g. ref. 11 ), since they quantify the network's ability to keep its normal behavior under external or internal perturbations. Note that each network measurement was normalized with respect to its original value, i.e. the measurement calculated from the network without perturbations. This approach was adopted since networks present different number of vertices and edges. Moreover, the studied measurements depend on the networks size and density of connections. Therefore, the normalization allowed us to investigate only the variation of the measurement while avoiding effects imposed by the network size and connection density. In Fig. 2 , it can be observed that all networks presented similar behavior. The main difference occurred for the largest component of the S. cerevisiae and C. elegans . Furthermore, the diameter and the average shortest path of all networks present very small variations. Therefore, the networks of all species exhibit similar resilience against random fails, not mattering the complexity of the organism. Indeed, this is a consequence of the fact that all these networks are scale-free presenting degree distribution that follows a power-law with an exponential cutoff, as shown in Fig. 1 . These obtained results corroborate experimental observations, which showed that a large number of perturbations does not result in any phenotypic perturbation variation under a given experimental condition. 13,14

In addition, the small values of the average shortest path length indicate that all considered protein networks are small-world, which can be a consequence of the presence of hubs. It is interesting to note that smaller sp values tended to be obtained for more complex species. In fact, the smaller the shortest path, the faster the communication between nodes, an aspect that can be related to resilience.32 The diameter of the networks seems to be preserved for all species, varying from 12 to 16. The average neighbor degree also is likely to be higher for more complex species, with the H. sapiens and D. melanogaster presenting the highest values.

Actually, the protein interaction networks of S. cerevisiae and C. elegans have the lowest degree exponent γ, which means that the topologies of these networks are mostly dominated by the highly connected proteins. In next sections, we verify that this property seems to be fundamental for defining the level of network resilience.
From Soup: 42 The resilience of protein – protein interaction networks was also investigated with respect to intentional attacks. In this case, the most connected nodes were removed sequentially, according to their degree, and a respective measurement was calculated. We performed such analysis removing upto 5% of the total number of vertices and obtained the relative variation of the giant component, network diameter and average shortest path length. As done in the case of random fails, the relative variation was obtained by the ratio between the measurement calculated when a fraction f of nodes was removed and the original measurement. Fig. 3 presents the obtained results. Different from the random fails, the structural variation of the networks under attacks depends on the organism complexity. In all cases, the more complex an organism, the more resilient it tends to be to intentional attacks. The protein – protein interactions of the D. melanogaster and H. sapiens are the most robust, while the network of the S. cerevisiae is the least resilient. In the next section, we investigate which topological properties are mainly responsible for protein network robustness.

From Soup: 43 Entropy-related measurements, namely the structural 17 and dynamic entropy, 19 have been taken into account for quantification of network robustness in networks. We adopted these measurements in order to identify which properties of networks contribute more decisively for the resilience of the protein – protein interaction networks. Table 1 presents the obtained entropy values for each network. Comparing these values with the curves in Fig. 2 and 3 , we can observe a good agreement between them, i.e. more resilient networks tend to have higher dynamic and structural entropies. In this way, we considered a set of six measurements and calculated their Pearson correlation coefficient with the entropy of connectivity distribution and the dynamics entropy. This approach allowed the identification of clear relationships between each given structural features and the overall network robustness. Fig. 4 presents the obtained relationships between the dynamic entropy and the adopted measurements.

From cou.: 44 The resilience of protein–protein interaction networks was also investigated with respect to intentional attacks. In this case, the most connected nodes were removed sequentially, according to their degree, and a respective measurement was calculated. We performed such analysis removing upto 5% of the total number of vertices and obtained the relative variation of the giant component, network diameter and average shortest path length. As done in the case of random fails, the relative variation was obtained by the ratio between the measurement calculated when a fraction f of nodes was removed and the original measurement. Fig. 3 presents the obtained results. Different from the random fails, the structural variation of the networks under attacks depends on the organism complexity. In all cases, the more complex an organism, the more resilient it tends to be to intentional attacks. The protein–protein interactions of the D. melanogaster and H. sapiens are the most robust, while the network of the S. cerevisiae is the least resilient. In the next section, we investigate which topological properties are mainly responsible for protein network robustness.
From Soup: 44 By comparing the correlation values, it can be observed that the average neighbor degree, r , and the coefficient of power law, γ , are the measurements that present the highest correlations with the entropies. These two properties are potentially contributing in a particularly strong way for the resilience altogether. In order to verify the difference between the average neighbor degrees of all considered species, we calculated the distributions of these measurements by taking into account only the removed hubs, which represent 5% of the total number of proteins . Fig. 5 shows the obtained results. The median values for each distribution are also indicated in this figure. We took into account the median instead of the mean because the distributions are not symmetric. 33 It can be observed that H. sapiens and D. melanogaster exhibit hubs with larger average neighbor degree than the S. cerevisiae and the C. elegans . Therefore, our results suggest that this mechanism of reinforcing the connections of the neighbors of hubs is particularly accountable for the higher resilience of more evolved organisms. Indeed, large values of average neighbor degree of hubs indicate alternative connections between neighbors of such nodes, which favor the network resilience. As a result, the high density of connections between nodes connected to hubs tends to minimize the hub removals.
 ###### 
From cou.: 45 Entropy-related measurements, namely the structural17 and dynamic entropy,19 have been taken into account for quantification of network robustness in networks. We adopted these measurements in order to identify which properties of networks contribute more decisively for the resilience of the protein–protein interaction networks. Table 1 presents the obtained entropy values for each network. Comparing these values with the curves in Fig. 2 and 3, we can observe a good agreement between them, i.e. more resilient networks tend to have higher dynamic and structural entropies. In this way, we considered a set of six measurements and calculated their Pearson correlation coefficient with the entropy of connectivity distribution and the dynamics entropy. This approach allowed the identification of clear relationships between each given structural features and the overall network robustness. Fig. 4 presents the obtained relationships between the dynamic entropy and the adopted measurements. The correlations between the entropy of the degree distribution and each measurement (ρ), as well as between the dynamic entropy and each network measurement, are also given in this figure.
From Soup: 45 Although the average neighbor degree and the coefficient of power law presented the highest correlation with the entropy coefficients, the other measurements also exhibit a significant correlation. The shortest path length is strongly correlated, negatively, with the dynamic entropy, indicating that small shortest path lengths favor resilience. In fact, the high density of connections among the neighbors of each node tends to create alternative paths between pairs of nodes reducing the network average shortest path length. The network diameter presents a smaller correlation with the entropy measurements than the average shortest path length. It is interesting to note that the assortativity coefficients are not strongly correlated with the resilience related measurements, indicating that this feature is not contributing significantly for the resilience. In fact, the smaller is this coefficient, the less robust the network. This result corroborated other works, which verified that the assortative network is considerably more robust against the removal of vertices than the disassortative networks. 28

From Soup: 46 The relationship between the structure and dynamics is a fundamental issue in complex networks theory. In order to investigate the behavior of protein – protein interaction networks under random fails and intentional attacks, we compared eight networks, corresponding to four species, namely the yeast S. cerevisiae , the worm C. elegans , the fly D. melanogaster and the H. sapiens . Computer simulations revealed that the diameter, shortest path length and size of the giant component have similar variations in all species when their respective networks are subjected to random removal of proteins . These results are in agreement with previous experimental observations, which showed that a large number of perturbations does not result in any phenotypic perturbation variation under a given experimental condition. 13,14 On the other hand, these networks revealed different topological variations when subjected to intentional attacks. As a matter of fact, the networks of H. sapiens and D. melanogaster are more robust under hubs removal than the networks of S. cerevisiae and C. elegans . Thus, more complex species tend to have higher resilience against intentional attacks in the respective network.

From Soup: 47 The relationship between resilience and network organization was analyzed by taking into account robustness related measurements—namely the entropy of the degree distribution and the dynamics entropy based on the Markov process—and topological measurements. We calculated the correlation between six structural measurements and these entropy-related quantities. We verified that two topological features contributed significantly for the resilience, namely the density of hubs, quantified by the coefficient of the power law degree distribution, and the average neighbor degree. Particularly, the analysis of the distribution of the average neighbor degree of the removed hubs for all species shows that these measurements are higher for more complex species. This indicates that the presence of alternative paths between the proteins connected to hubs reinforces the resilience. The remaining four studied measurements also contributed for resilience, but less decisively.

From Soup: 48 The results presented in the current paper are fundamental for the understanding of the relationship between the large scale organization of protein – protein interaction networks and the respective biological functions. The particularly investigated role, i.e. the resilience, is related to biological evolution and organism organization. 34 Thus, the identification of which role is favoring the evolution can help the development of computational models of protein network evolution, such as ref. 35 , and understand which mechanisms are used during the natural evolution to produce robust architectures. Further investigation can be performed by taking into account other network topological measurements and other removal dynamics, such as considering the deletion of nodes belonging to a given class of proteins . Edges removal can also be investigated by a similar approach. Other measurements for quantification of the resilience of protein interaction networks can also be developed. The application of resilience analysis with respect to metabolic and transcriptional regulatory networks constitutes another promising investigation.
