From cou.: 1 The dynamic behaviour of the binuclear µ-hydrido µ-carbonyl cations with chelating diphosphines, [Pt2(P–P)2(µ-H)(µ-CO)]+ [P–P = dppe, 1, dppp, 2, and dppb, 3] have been investigated by multinuclear (1H, 31P and 195Pt) variable temperature NMR spectroscopy. The 195Pt and 1H results are consistent with intramolecular mutual exchange of the P atoms with respect to the bridging ligands in all of the complexes 1–3. A detailed dynamical analysis carried out on complexes 2 and 3 shows that the dynamical process exchanges the P atoms within a single diphosphino ligand, and excludes the simultaneous P atom exchange in both ligands. The bite of the diphosphino ligands affects the rate of this process in the order 3 > 2 > 1. The process follows an activation law with ΔH‡ = 67 and 60 kJ mol−1 for 2 and 3, respectively, so that P–Pt bond breaking should not be involved. The positive activation entropy (17–19 J K−1 mol−1) hints at a mechanism where the intermediate(s) have a less ordered structure than that of the stable complex. In accordance with the NMR results, two reactivity experiments provided further evidence of the intramolecular nature of the observed dynamics and exclude any equilibration path via Pt–P and/or Pt–Pt bond breaking. On these grounds, a mechanism involving rotation about a Pt–Pt bond could be proposed.

From cou.: 2 Transition metal complexes comprising M–H and M–CO bonds play a fundamental role in many stoichiometric and catalytic reactions either in homogeneous and heterogeneous processes, such as hydrogenation, hydroformylation, hydrocarbon cracking and so on.1 They often undergo fluxional processes and then the dynamic behaviour of polynuclear complexes is crucial to understand the interaction of the ligands with multiple metal centres and better explain known reactions and foresee new ones.2

From cou.: 4 During investigations on binuclear platinum hydrides, some of us obtained unusual platinum(I) species [Pt2(P–P)2(μ-H)(μ-CO)]+‡ with several chelating diphosphines.5 Afterwards, two homologous Pd(I) complexes with dipp6 and (S,S)-bdpp7 ligands have been reported. The only known homologue with a monodentate phosphine, namely [Pd2(PPh3)4(μ-H)(μ-CO)]+, was proposed by Zudin et al.8 as a possible intermediate in olefin insertion and in the water–gas shift reaction. The possible role of these species in reactions catalysed by organometallic Pd(II) complexes has been outlined and discussed.7,8 To elucidate their reactivity, different mono- or binuclear intermediates, originated from breaking of the Pd–Pd molecular core or from rotation around one of the bridging ligands, have been considered.

From cou.: 5 Both Pt and Pd complexes show fluxional behaviour on the NMR time scale, namely exchange between the phosphorus atoms that averages their magnetic interactions over a wide temperature range. In the solid state, X-ray crystal structure determinations (M = Pt, P–P = dppe,5b dppcpFe,5c M = Pd, P–P = dippp6a) showed that the two metal centres are in a tetrahedrally-distorted square-planar arrangement with H and CO as bridging ligands and short M–M separations, as expected in diamagnetic d9–d9 complexes. Accordingly, M–μ-C–M angles are rather narrow (< 88°), in contrast to a description of these complexes as “metal–aldehydes”, i.e., as M(II) species.

From cou.: 7 The binuclear µ-hydrido µ-carbonyl cations with chelating diphosphines, [M2(P–P)2(µ-H)(µ-CO)]+ (M = Pd, Pt),5–8 (Scheme 1) show averaging of J-coupling to 31P at high temperature, a clear indication of exchange dynamics. Since these cations contain several magnetic nuclei, they are excellent candidates for following this process by multinuclear VT-NMR spectroscopy, in particular when M = Pt. In principle, the advantage of Pt derivatives consists in the possibility to monitor all the core nuclei (1H, 13C, 31P and 195Pt) and to get to the static situation at higher temperature, due to the known higher rigidity of Pt complexes. As a further benefit, the presence of the relative dilute 195Pt nucleus (I = 1/2; natural abundance: 33.8%) allows one to exploit the X-approximation approach9 that produces, inter alia, a definite simplification of the analysis of strongly coupled 31P NMR spectra (see below).

From cou.: 8 In the present case, the bridging hydrido NMR results from the superposition of three sub-spectra arising from the three different isotopomeric combinations of the platinum nuclei, namely: (i) a central singlet from molecules without 195Pt nuclei (43.8%); (ii) a doublet from molecules containing one 195Pt (44 .8%); (iii) a binomial triplet from molecules having two 195Pt (11.4%). Therefore, the hydrido NMR spectrum consists of a quintet of approximate relative intensities 1 ∶ 8 ∶ 18 ∶ 8 ∶ 1 (Fig. 1(a)). The fine structure of each line of the three sub-spectra is determined by 31P couplings. At higher temperature (Fig. 1(b)), each line is split into a quintet indicating the magnetic equivalence of the four P atoms (A4Y spin system), consistent with a fast exchange process. At lower temperature (Fig. 1(c)), exchange is hindered and the molecule becomes rigid so that each line is split into a triplet of triplets consistent with coupling to two pairs of chemically equivalent 31P nuclei (AA′XX′Y spin system), namely the two Pcis (P1, P2) and the two Ptrans (P3, P4) (See Scheme 1 for numbering). The individual 1H NMR transitions within each 195Pt isotopomeric sub-spectrum can be uniquely labelled by the nuclear spin state of the four 31P nuclei. In the following, we use labels such as κλμν to denote that P1 is in spin state κ, P2 is in spin state λ, and so on. For instance, αααβ refers to the 1H NMR transition where P4 is in spin state β, whereas P1, P2 and P3 are in spin state α.

The static lH{31P} spectra provided the hydrido chemical shift and the 195Pt connectivity (1JH–Pt) and comparison with the corresponding 1H spectra afforded the 31P connectivity (2JH–Ptrans and 2JH–Pcis). An illustrative example of this method will be given below for complex 1 (Fig. 2).

From cou.: 11 Table 1 summarises the 1H NMR data relative to static regime along with Tlimit, the temperature below which no further spectral modification in the hydrido region was observed. The inspection of these data indicates a close similarity between complexes 1–3 both in chemical shift and in J-coupling. The chemical shift falls in a narrow range (−1.66 to +0.83 ppm) depending on the diphosphino ligand as in the parent trihydrido complexes, [Pt2(P–P)2H3)]+.10 The low H–Pt coupling, from 450 to 484 Hz, is consistent with a hydride bridging two PtP2 moieties.11 The H–P couplings, the larger one assigned to H–Ptrans and the smaller one to H–Pcis, are in accord with a square planar coordination, according to the reported X-ray crystal structures of Pt5b,c and Pd6a derivatives. The negative sign of 2JH–Pcis is obtained from the averaged couplings measured in the fast exchange regime [ĴH–P = (2JH–Ptrans + 2JH–Pcis)/2], from the dynamical evolution of the spectra, and is also supported by theory.12 Conversely, the observed Tlimit strongly varies among 1–3 and appears related to the chemical shift difference between Pcis and Ptrans nuclei (Table 2).

From cou.: 12 The analysis of the variable temperature 1H spectra shows further analogies among 1–3 and provides preliminary information about the dynamics. In all cases, the static-regime triplet-of-triplets pattern at low temperature translates into a motionally-narrowed quintet pattern at high temperature (see Fig. 1). In the whole temperature range explored: (i) the H–Pt couplings remain unaffected, (ii) the H–P couplings are maintained and simply averaged, (iii) transitions ββββ and αααα (cf. Fig. 1) are not broadened by the dynamic process. These results point to an intramolecular mutual exchange process.

From cou.: 14 In spite of the poor resolution, the lH VT-NMR spectra of complex 1 evidenced some features apparently peculiar in a series of strictly homologous compounds, so that complex 1 was examined in a wider temperature range (183–348 K). Unfortunately, the fast exchange limit could not be reached because the complex decomposes at T > 348 K in solution.

From cou.: 15 The appearance of the 1H spectra of complexes 1–3 at 300 K suggests a quasi-static regime for 1, slow motion for 2 and a fast motional regime for 3, hence rigidity increases as 3 < 2 < 1, whereas Tlimit follows the order 2 > 3 > 1 (Table 1). This discrepancy results from the behaviour of complex 1 which has the lowest Tlimit (186 K) but displays the slower dynamics at RT.

From cou.: 16 To facilitate the discussion, selected 1H VT-NMR spectra of complex 1 are shown in Fig. 2. Only the central sub-spectrum and the contiguous upper field satellite (δ 0.6 and −0.22, respectively, at 279 K) could be clearly observed, so that, we limit our analysis to these two sub-spectra. The assignment is unequivocally supported by the 1H{31P} spectrum (Fig. 2(a)) which shows the quintet pattern due to 195Pt coupling (relative intensities 1 ∶ 8 ∶ 18 ∶ 8 ∶ 1) and, in addition, allows one to obtain accurate Pt–H couplings. Straightforward comparison with the corresponding 1H spectrum (Fig. 2(b)) highlights the splitting of these lines due to 31P coupling. In this case, the satellite line is split into a well-resolved triplet of triplets while the central sub-spectrum appears as a broad triplet. Rather surprisingly, an opposite imprint was observed at lower temperature (Fig. 2(c)): a broader triplet and a well-resolved triplet of triplets are found for the satellite and the central sub-spectra, respectively. Considering the whole dynamical range, both sub-spectra follow the typical patterns depicted in Fig. 1. However, the central sub-spectrum reaches the static limit at 186 K and approaches the expected quintet (ĴH–P = 34 Hz) at our highest measurement temperature (348 K, 200.13 MHz, C2D2Cl4). The satellite sub-spectrum is frozen at a definitely higher temperature (283 K) and the averaged quintet cannot be perceived at 348 K. These unexpected findings seem to indicate that the central and the satellite sub-spectra are differently affected by the exchange dynamics, i.e., that the introduction of 195Pt in complex 1 differentiates the isotopomeric spin systems. However, the various isotopomers should share a common exchange mechanism and have very similar, if not identical, activation parameters since isotopic effects are expected to be small. As for the spin system itself, the data collected in Table 2 show that the major difference between 1 and 2–3 is the chemical shift difference between Pcis and Ptrans. The latter is much larger for 2 and 3 (14.1 and 10.4 ppm, respectively) than for 1 (ca. 2 ppm). However, the lH NMR spectrum is not sensitive to interactions not involving protons such as P and Pt chemical shift and Pt–P J-coupling.

From cou.: 19 A detailed theoretical treatment of dynamical NMR spectroscopy in the studied complexes is given in the Computational details section. Here the main points are briefly summarized. The exchange of 195Pt nuclei has no effect on the individual hydrido 1H NMR sub-spectra, so we can restrict our attention to one of the 195Pt sub-spectra (see Fig. 1) and consider a simplified spin system consisting of the observed hydrido proton plus four 31P nuclei, labelled as in Scheme 1. Group theory13 reveals that this system may undergo exchange between six sites, all of which have the same NMR spectrum. Sites are interconverted by three types of exchange reactions which unfortunately have not a simple chemical interpretation. For future reference, we note that, within this six-site model, only two 1H NMR lines are not affected by exchange, namely those with spin configuration of the 31P nuclei αααα and ββββ. Therefore, this model predicts that all but two lines broaden and coalesce due to exchange. However, the six-site model does not agree with the known chemical structure and behaviour of the studied complexes, since it allows exchange between phosphorus nuclei belonging to different ligands. If group-theoretical results are constrained by retaining only chemically-sound structures, we are left with a four-site model where each of the three exchange reaction sets has a well-defined chemical meaning. Set I comprises the trivial identity, i.e., no exchange. Set II consists of the simultaneous exchange of the cis and trans31P nuclei of both diphosphino ligands or, equivalently, of the hydrido and CO ligands. Set III comprises reactions that exchange the cis and trans phosphorus nuclei of a single diphosphine. We denote the exchange rates of the last two sets as kII and kIII. Within the four-site model, the 1H NMR lines not affected by exchange are those with spin configuration of the 31P nuclei αααα, ββββ, αβαβ and βαβα.

From cou.: 21 The 195Pt-satellite sub-spectra of the hydrido NMR (see Fig. 3) could be extremely well fitted in the whole temperature range within the four-site model using reaction set III only. Reaction set II cannot account for the observed line-shapes as is best appreciated in Fig. 3(b)–(e). The reason is that the central line is not broadened by type II double-exchange so that the amplitude ratio of this line to the other ones is not correct. This can be understood by reference to Fig. 1 as follows. Within the four-site model, the central line is affected by exchange only through the αββα and βααβ spin configurations. Under double exchange these are transformed into each other and hence do not undergo line broadening. Conversely, single exchange transforms the αββα and βααβ configurations into ββαα/ααββ and ααββ/ββαα, respectively, thus causing dynamical broadening (see ESI† for details). Finally, no fit quality improvement is obtained when both sets are used simultaneously. Therefore, 31P exchange in single ligand within the four-site model suffices to fully explain the experimental data. The reaction rates kIII are presented as an Arrhenius plot in Fig. 5. The results of the fit of kIII to Arrhenius and to Eyring law are shown in Table 3. In all cases the linear correlation coefficient is 0.9998, illustrating the excellent quality of both the line-shape and the Arrhenius/Eyring fit.

From cou.: 22 At first, the central (no 195Pt) sub-spectrum from hydrido NMR (see Fig. 4) did not yield such clear-cut results both for 2 and 3. Indeed, it could not be fitted within the four-site model even with both reaction sets. Using the six-site model with both reaction sets, satisfactory fits could be obtained. However, significant line-shape disagreement can be observed, especially for the central line (see Fig. 4(b)–(d)), and the overall fit quality is inferior to that obtained in the dynamical analysis of the satellite sub-spectrum (compare Figs. 3 and 4). Moreover, kII does not follow an activation law (it even has a negative slope for T > 263 K) and kIII only roughly does. Even more troublesome is to justify the existence of structures where each diphosphine is ligated to both platinum atoms. These difficulties make the six-site dynamical model highly improbable.

 ###### 
From cou.: 23 The main difference between the satellite and the central sub-spectra is the intrinsic width of the transitions with 31P spin configuration αβαβ and βαβα, i.e., those not affected by exchange. Therefore, we tried to fit the central sub-spectrum within the four-site model augmented with another free parameter corresponding to cross-relaxation between the above mentioned transitions. As shown in Fig. 4, not only did we obtain excellent line-shape fits at all temperatures, but the qualitative features coincide with those from the dynamical analysis of the satellite sub-spectrum. In particular, 31P single-ligand exchange within the augmented four-site model suffices to explain the experimental data; the temperature dependence of kIII almost exactly follows an activation law (see Fig. 5); even more importantly, Arrhenius and Eyring analysis yielded parameters which coincide with those obtained from the satellite sub-spectra within experimental error (see Table 3).

From cou.: 24 It remains to justify the presence of the cross-correlation term on an a posteriori basis. Surely, the identity of all results from the dynamical analysis of hydride NMR spectroscopy makes the above assumption sound, since exchange phenomena should not be affected by the substitution of 195Pt for non-magnetic platinum isotopes. Moreover, comparison of the secular and cross-relaxation widths for the central and satellite spectra shows that these parameters have a correct statistical behaviour (see ESI† for details).

From cou.: 25 In conclusion, the dynamic behaviour of the 1H NMR spectra can be totally ascribed to reaction set III, i.e., to the exchange of the 31P nuclei within a single diphosphine ligand. The process closely follows an activation law with activation enthalpy ΔH‡ = 67 and 60 kJ mol−1 for 2 and 3, respectively, so that P–Pt bond breaking should not be involved. The broader bite of the diphosphine ligands in 3 decreases ΔH‡ by 7 kJ mol−1. A lower value (ΔH‡ = 40 kJ mol−1) was obtained14 for exchange in the Pd(I) complex with monodentate phosphine, [Pd2(PPh3)4(μ-H)(μ-CO)]+. The positive activation entropy (ΔS‡ = 17–19 J K−1 mol−1) hints at a mechanism where the intermediate(s) have structure somehow less ordered than that of the stable complex. On these grounds, a mechanism involving rotation about the Pt–Pt bond could be suggested, such as that pictured in Scheme 2(b).

From cou.: 27 The 31P{1H} static-regime spectra for the complexes 1–3 are shown in Fig. 6. The sub-spectra due to the isotopomer without 195Pt nuclei are consistent with an AA′BB′ (1) and an AA′XX′ spin system (2 and 3), respectively. These results strongly differentiate 1 and account for its peculiar dynamic in the 1–3 series. Since Tlimit follows the Δν of the exchanging P1/2 and P3/4 nuclei, 1, because of the relatively low Δν value (Table 2), reaches the slow motion regime at the lowest temperature, in spite of the greatest rigidity. The 31P{1H} sub-spectra due to the isotopomers with one active 195Pt (AA′XX′M pattern) are in all cases amenable to first order approximation analysis and easily provide the coupling constant values reported in Table 2. Although the intensity of the spectrum due to the third isotopomer is usually too low to be properly analysed, the combination transitions due to (1J + 2J)P3/4–Pt and (1J + 2J)P1/2–Pt can be easily observed and the relative sign of the involved couplings assigned. Due to the strongly different trans-influence between the bridging ligands (μ-CO ≫ μ-H), two well distinct sets of 1JP–Pt values (1JP1/2–Pt ≪ 1JP3/4–Pt) characterise the two P binding sites and allow the definite assignment for P1/2 and P3/4 as trans-CO and trans-H, respectively. The differences between the two binding sites as well as among the different ring sizes (five-, 1, six-, 2 and seven-, 3, membered rings) are mirrored in the chemical shift differences, either in each of these cations (Pcis < Ptrans) and within the 1–3 series. According to the different strain of the (P–P)Pt cycles, which implies different ΔR contributions,15 the observed deshielding with respect to the free ligands of both P donors (Pcis and Ptrans) is smaller for 3 and 2 than for 1 and possibly explains the observed differences.

From cou.: 28 The dependence of the chemical shift difference between the two binding sites on the opposite ligand and on the chelating diphosphine observed in each of the species 1–3 (Pcis < Ptrans) can better be considered in terms of the quantity Δδ = δ(H3)–δ(H,CO), that is the chemical shift difference between the complex and the corresponding trihydride, [Pt2(P–P)2(H)3]+,10i.e., the precursors of cations 1–3. On this basis, we observe that the trans-CO P1/2 is significantly shifted at higher field in the sequence 1 > 2 > 3 (Δδ = 14.4, 12.3 and 11.5, respectively). At variance the trans-H P3/4 is slightly affected in the cases of complexes 2 (Δδ = −3.9) and 3 (Δδ = 1.1) but is strongly displaced at higher fields for complex 1 (Δδ = 13.5), so that cation 1 could appear anomalous. However, the same trend is observed in similar platinum hydrides bearing different C-bridged ligands, such as the μ-isocyanide [Pt2(P–P)2(μ-H)(μ-CNR)]+,5a,b or the μ-alkylidene [Pt2(P–P)2(μ-H)(μ-CHCH2R)]+16 compounds. Moreover, the cation [Pt2(dcype)2(μ-H)(μ-CO)]+, i.e., the homologous of 3 with aliphatic substituents, behaves analogously: the Pcis and Ptrans signals are nearly overlapped and largely displaced with respect to the signal of the hydrido precursor (Δδ: 19.0).5d This suggests that the effect of the opposite ligand on the P shift is significant with strong donors such as CO, whereas with the simplest ligand hydride, the dominant role is played by the size of the chelating ring. Finally, we observe that the 3JP1–P2 values increase upon decrease of the (P–P)Pt ring sizes. The influence of the ring sizes on the electronic distribution in the inner core of binuclear platinum hydrides was previously outlined by Tulip et al. who observed an increase of the s character of Pt orbital bonding upon decrease of the ring size.17

From cou.: 29 A further dynamic process has been observed in complex 3 at temperatures below Tlimit (228 K). The lower resolution of the slow exchange spectrum of 3 (Fig. 6) together with the additional broadening observed by further lowering the temperature, led us to presume the presence of motion at 228 K and the onset of a new process at lower temperature. The system was monitored by 31P (see ESI†) and 1H NMR from 228 to 175 K, where the solution freezes. The 31P spectra remain rather broad down to 175 K, and do not provide significant insight, apart from indicating the presence of a low activation energy process. A valuable hint was instead given by the 1H results. Even if no significant variation occurred in the hydrido region throughout the studied temperature range, at T < 209 K the apparent degeneracy of the signals due to the CH2 protons next to the P atom was raised and a splitting of these transitions observed. Besides, a similar experiment performed on complex 2 led to analogous results for T < 196 K. These findings rule out any exchange of Pcis and Ptrans, rather they hint at a slowing down of phosphine side-chain conformational motion.

The resonances of complex 3 disappeared almost immediately giving rise to a complex mixture of platinum-containing species. At variance from analogous experiments carried out on the Pd derivatives,7 no resonance from hydrido complexes was observed.

From cou.: 34 195Pt NMR spectroscopy confirmed the overall picture about complexes 1–3. The analysis of the spin system and of the experimental results refer to the isotopomer with a single magnetic nucleus, since the lines due to isotopomers with two 195Pt are very weak. In the static regime, the magnetic Pt nucleus is coupled, in addition to the hydrido proton, to four phosphorus atoms P3, P1, P4 and P2 (ordered on the basis of J magnitude) resulting in 16 transitions (labelled as in the ESI†) for each hydrido proton spin state. Accordingly, the 300 K spectrum of 1, in static regime, consists of an AA′XX′M spin system and displays the expected 16-line pattern, (Fig. 7). In the intermediate exchange regime, the experimental findings for complex 2 (Fig. 7) display the unaffected spectral lines with 31P nuclear spin configurations ββββ, ββαα, ααββ, αααα. This result is perfectly consistent with the mechanistic hypothesis formulated and with the coupling values of Table 2, in particular with a negative sign for 2JPt–P1. Last, the evolution of the spectral pattern to the fast exchange limit (A2X2M spin system) is expected to produce a triplet of triplets centred at δPt with a large coupling J = (1JPt–P1 + 1JPt–P3)/2 and a small one J = (2JPt–P2 + 2JPt–P4)/2 being the ββββ and αααα transitions the outside lines of the spectrum. Again, our NMR findings agree with this picture. Although none of complexes 1–3 has reached in our experimental range (193–300 K) such a fast exchange limit, the 195Pt spectrum of 3, measured at 42.8 MHz and 300 K, clearly evidences the incoming new lines between the transitions (ββββ, ββαα) and (ααββ, αααα) and a triplet emerging at the centre of the system.

From cou.: 35 VT-NMR spectroscopy of all of the magnetic nuclei (1H, 31P and 195Pt) provided a detailed description of the spin system on complexes 1–3. Many spin Hamiltonian parameters have been accurately determined and the dynamical line-shape analysis revealed that the main dynamical process is the exchange of the two P nuclei belonging to a single diphosphino ligand. Accurate exchange activation parameters have been obtained. Unfortunately, NMR spectroscopy resulted to be in itself unable to give an unquestionable picture of the chemical mechanism underlying the 31P exchange dynamics of [M2(P–P)2(µ-H)(µ-CO)]+ complexes, because of the high molecular symmetry or the possible presence of intermediates elusive on the NMR time scale. Besides, the activation parameters are not in disagreement with the literature suggestions on the possible mechanisms.5b,7,14 However, some conclusions can be drawn by considering the whole of reactivity, structure, and spectroscopic data reported for these cations.

From cou.: 37 A mechanism involving the geometrical rearrangement on both metal centres was not excluded a priori,7 but was overshadowed by the observed bridge-splitting reactions (iv) that led to suggest an equilibration process via rotation around a M–X–M bond (X = CO or H) in the two equally possible mono-bridged tautomers. However, this route implicitly requires the M–M cleavage to equilibrate the four P atoms. The occurrence of bridge-splitting processes is of course out of the question, and M–M bond breaking does not seem reasonable. In fact, leaving out sophisticated explanations for the diamagnetic behaviour, points (iii)–(vii) provide compelling evidence about the strength of the M–M bond. For instance, the fragmentation pattern of cations 1–3 in the vapour phase (vi) indicates that the M–M bond is the strongest bond in the molecular core. The kinetic energy release values associated to the easy loss of HCO are lower by one order of magnitude than those calculated for the 3 H loss from the corresponding trihydrido precursors, [Pt2(P–P)2(H)3]+.20 From a different point of view, and in addition to analogous substitution products (iv), the substitution of the bridging carbonyl with a sterically demanding isocyanide in solution gave the complex [(H)(P–P)Pt–Pt(P–P)(CNR)]+ (P–P = dppe; R = (CH3)3CNC),5b4, bearing only terminal ligands, which can be considered as the effective intermediate in substitution reactions.

From cou.: 38 All these considerations strengthen the hypothesis that the equilibration process of the cations 1–3 occurs by rotation around the M–M bond, as illustrated in Scheme 2, i.e. through a tautomer in which both H and CO ligands are terminally bonded as in the above mentioned complex 4. Indeed, easy rotation of two (P–P)Pt moieties around the Pt–Pt bond has recently been observed in the polymorphic Pt(I) hydride [Pt2(dfepe)2(H)2] in the solid state.21

From cou.: 45 First, we analyse the symmetry properties of that part of the spin Hamiltonian that determines the frequency of hydrido 1H NMR spin transitions by group-theoretical methods. Denoting the phosphorus nuclear sites with index i = 1, 2, 3, 4 (see Scheme 1) and noting that exchange of 195Pt ions has no effect on the individual hydrido NMR sub-spectrum, we can write a restricted spin Hamiltonian suited to our goal as (in frequency units): where ωH0 is the chemically shifted Larmor frequency of the proton, JPi–H = JH–Pcis for phosphorus sites i = 1, 2 and JPi–H = JH–Ptrans for phosphorus sites i = 3, 4.

From cou.: 46 Clearly, this spin Hamiltonian is invariant under the permutations (1)(2)(3)(4) = identity, (12)(34), (12)(3)(4) and (1)(2)(34). Because of these symmetry properties the 24 possible nuclear configurations of the complexes correspond to only six unique spin Hamiltonians. Therefore, the 24 nuclear configurations can be grouped into six equivalence classes (A, B, …, F) which are shown in Table 4. Similarly, the 24 possible exchange reactions can be grouped into three sets. Each of these sets corresponds to an NMR differentiable reaction.13 These reaction sets are schematically depicted in Fig. 8. Since set I comprises trivial identity reactions, we have formally defined a six-site exchange model with only two exchange rates, denoted kII and kIII. Within this model, only two lines are not affected by exchange, namely those with 31P spin configurations αααα and ββββ.

From cou.: 47 As can be seen comparing Table 4 with Scheme 1, many nuclear configurations do not agree with the chemical structure of the studied complexes, where each diphosphine is cis ligated to a single platinum atom. If only chemically-sound structures are retained, we are left with eight configurations (bold-face in Table 4), which result in only four equivalence classes (A′, B′, E′, F′) and eight exchange reactions, but again three NMR differentiable reactions. Reaction sets have now a well-defined chemical meaning, as can be appreciated comparing Scheme 1, Table 4, and Fig. 8. Set II consists of the simultaneous exchange of the cis and trans phosphorus nuclei of both diphosphino ligands or, equivalently, of the hydrido and CO ligands. Set III comprises reactions that exchange the cis and trans phosphorus nuclei of a single diphosphine. Therefore, if only chemically-sound structures are allowed, we are left with a four-site exchange model with exchange rates kII and kIII. Within this model, the lines not affected by exchange are those with 31P spin configurations αααα, ββββ, αβαβ and βαβα.
