From cou.: 1 Efforts in evolutionary developmental biology have shed light on how organs are developed and why evolution has selected some structures instead of others. These advances in the understanding of organogenesis along with the most recent techniques of organotypic cultures, tissue bioprinting and synthetic biology provide the tools to hack the physical and genetic constraints in organ development, thus opening new avenues for research in the form of completely designed or merely altered settings. Here we propose a unifying framework that connects the concept of morphospace (i.e. the space of possible structures) with synthetic biology and tissue engineering. We aim for a synthesis that incorporates our understanding of both evolutionary and architectural constraints and can be used as a guide for exploring alternative design principles to build artificial organs and organoids. We present a three-dimensional morphospace incorporating three key features associated to organ and organoid complexity. The axes of this space include the degree of complexity introduced by developmental mechanisms required to build the structure, its potential to store and react to information and the underlying physical state. We suggest that a large fraction of this space is empty, and that the void might offer clues for alternative ways of designing and even inventing new organs.

From cou.: 2 The twenty-first century has witnessed the advent of synthetic biology, a new spin on biological engineering tasked with developing strategies for the purposeful modification of biological components in order to obtain novel and useful functions or behaviours in living organisms. This discipline has been enabled by several technological innovations that help synthetic biologists systematically alter biological information, by reorganising genes and coding and regulatory sequences, guided by the extensive knowledge gathered by cellular and molecular biologists.

From cou.: 3 Synthetic biology has been inspired by traditional engineering principles such as predictability, modularity and scalability. When these properties are available to the engineer, a bottom-up approach to the design and building of machines (living or otherwise) can be pursued. This means, as with other long-established engineering disciplines like electronics, that a collection of parts with well-defined functionality and behaviour can be used to construct more complicated machines by means of appropriately connecting and combining these components. This view has been repeatedly articulated as an implicit design approach to biological systems within the synthetic biology community: artificial constructs can be obtained from collections of lower-level components in such a way that their performance and behaviour are essentially modular and predictable.1

 ###### 
From cou.: 4 Such expected predictability needs to be confronted with the existence of the so-called emergent properties.3–11 These properties relate to higher-order phenomena that result from the interactions among components belonging to the low-level scale3 that cannot be reduced to the properties of the lower-scale elements. Examples of emergent phenomena include cellular and molecular assemblies,12 morphogenesis,13,14 collective behavior in social animals,15–17 cancer cell patterns,18 microbial population growth19 or neural networks and brains.20,21 In a nutshell, neither the construction of a nest nor the cognitive complexity of a neural network can be reduced to the dynamics of single ants or neurones, yet they are brought about by the countless interactions among the lower-level entities.

From cou.: 5 At the level of tissues and organs, self-organisation processes provide multiple illustrations of how higher-order patterns emerge.22–24 Similarly, many of the outcomes of development escape explanations confined to the gene or gene network levels. Morphogenetic mechanisms rely on tightly regulated chains of events and a dynamical change of boundaries resulting from the growth, deformation and chemical modification of tissues. This feedback between agents and their environment, also known as stigmergy,25,26 is a crucial feature of many collective phenomena. The presence of emergence does not limit our understanding of nature, but clearly defines a limit to what can be predicted from a detailed understanding of the component parts. In fact, the physics of phase transitions shows that most examples of collective dynamics can be accurately explained by means of models that largely ignore these details. Instead, interactions and boundary conditions play the leading role.5,7

From cou.: 6 Nonetheless, despite the common acceptance of the interrelation between environmental constraints, cellular self-organisation and gene regulation,27 some controversy persists today. Most research has been traditionally focused on a reductionist program dealing almost exclusively with genes, treating the organism as a mere epiphenomenon28 (Fig. 1a). Models of pattern formation based on positional information would illustrate this idea: a given signal gradient provides a cue to differentiation that is easily interpreted by cells. A more complete view was provided by the late Pere Alberch (Fig. 1b), linking gene regulation and transcription to tissue geometry. Once again, gene expression can only be seen as a necessary condition for morphogenetic dynamics, but it is far from sufficient. Even simple models of interaction between pattern formation and tissue/organ geometry reveal complex interactions that are not reducible to linear mappings.29–32

From cou.: 7 The lack of a simple genotype–phenotype mapping is a consequence of two key components. One is the information associated to cell interactions, geometry and boundary conditions in embryogenesis. The second is the widespread use of tinkering made by evolution,33 which defines in fact a crucial difference between evolution and engineering. Whereas the human inventor can create novel structures out of new designs or materials, evolution does not. Sometimes, tinkering leads to optimality, and natural designs fit the expectation of the engineer. This is the case of most branching patterns that can be found within large living systems (Fig. 1c). In this case, the system displays a self-similar organisation of nested trees that can be fully understood as a problem of embedding the tree structure in a given finite space. But in most developmental processes (Fig. 1d) tinkering leads to tangled networks of interactions.34–36

From cou.: 8 How is this connected with the potential to create synthetic organs? Engineers aim to construct functional objects given a repertoire of available components and design rules, often inspired by the scalability of electronic designs. What are the limits of our potential for engineering living tissues? Are there multiple solutions to design organs to solve a given problem? A tentative answer might come from the widespread presence of convergent evolution:37 the same solutions to given problems are found independently. This is illustrated by the camera eye, which has evolved multiple times in different lineages to essentially the same design. This includes the broadest range of groups (Fig. 2a and b) from marine snails, squids or some types of jellyfish to the vertebrate eye and even the ocelloids of some single-celled dinoflagellates38,39 (Fig. 2c). The widespread emergence of this structure might result from a combination of optimal design (there is one solution that humans also discovered while inventing cameras) and self-organisation processes associated to the morphogenesis of eyes. Yoshiki Sasai's classic experiments40–42 on the formation of primordial eyes from embryonic stem cells (Fig. 2) illustrate this. Here structural motifs are generated from the interactions between genetic and cellular-level mechanisms. Embodiment, self-organisation and system-level constraints play a leading role. This gives an important message to engineers aiming at creating new organs: both self-organisation and emergence are likely to be inevitable (but perhaps helpful) components of future bioengineering procedures.

From cou.: 9 Here we aim to present a new picture of the design space of organs and organoids. Our goal is to provide a balanced view of the space of possible structures that include both natural and some artificial systems. This is known as the morphospace.45–49 The morphospace has been extensively used within evolutionary biology as a way of describing the spectrum of physically possible forms available to a given group of organisms. But the approach can be made general and applied to networks.50–53 Two main lessons can be extracted from the analysis of these spaces. One is that the occupied regions indicate accessible solutions for evolved systems as well as potential trade-offs that constrain the structural designs achievable. The second is that the presence of empty spaces can indicate (a) impossible designs or evolutionarily improbable designs or (b) designs that might not be accessible under some conditions but can be achieved through engineering approaches. Any of these possibilities is relevant when dealing with design principles for synthetic biology. Empty spaces might indicate that strong constraints forbid us from achieving solutions in that domain. However, they might be simply unlikely to be generated by evolution, but accessible to our engineering skills. If that is the case, we can obtain valuable lessons and guidance concerning our potential for engineering biological systems following orthogonal schemes. Moreover, if synthetic biology can be understood as a way to interrogate nature,54 the morphospace can also be a powerful guideline to ask ourselves about the logic of biological organisation and its limits.

From cou.: 10 The morphospace that we want to build must include both natural organs and artificial, designed systems. In order to define the right axes for our organ space, we will first review the different ways in which engineers and synthetic biologists have been able to tame cells and their environments, thus potentially expanding the space of possible designs. This will provide us a general picture of the different approaches aimed to change both functional and structural patterns in living tissues and organs, but also of the twilight zone that separates a standard definition of organ from what can be obtained by artificial means.

From cou.: 11 To developmental biologists, an organ is a collection of tissues joined in a structural unit to perform a specific function, with the tissue being an ensemble of similar cells with a common origin that carry out a function.55 However, the boundaries of what defines an organ are blurred once we enter the artificial domain, where organs can be constructed from cells of different origin and might harbour differently altered genotypes for instance. An organ then could be redefined as a set of agents able to implement a common function, but also able to communicate and be coordinated in order to build temporal and spatial order. In this context, microbial biofilms living in our teeth or gut could be seen as an organ, but also bioprinted tissues, chip encapsulated organs, as well as tumours or organoids, since they are functionally coherent structures. Moreover, artificial organs can incorporate non-biological materials and communicate with electronic components, thus pushing the boundaries of the possible (Fig. 3). Those readers already familiar with these techniques can go straight to Section 3.

From cou.: 13 Genome editing tools allow high specificity, low interference genomic modifications.80,81 The engineering of programmable DNA nucleases, like zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN), TALENs or CRISPR-Cas9, allows the introduction of double strand breaks at specific sites of the DNA. ZFN and TALENs are chimeric proteins which consist of DNA binding domains (ZFs or TALEs) and a nuclease,82–84 while the CRISPR-Cas9 platform85 consists of a small RNA sequence, namely ‘guide RNA’ (CRISPR), able to recognise the DNA sequences of interest and Cas9, which can display nuclease activity, among others.86 Nonetheless, there are still challenges that need to be confronted to have a widespread use of these techniques in mammalian cells.87–90 An alternative is the use of artificial chromosome structures able to incorporate whole synthetic gene networks.91

From cou.: 14 The control of epigenetic processes allows one to write new developmental programs (Fig. 4a).65,66 Contributions range from the use of optogenetics64 to the direct efficient targeted demethylation through TALEs fused to a catalytic domain.92 TALEs fused to histone demethylase63 and CRISPR-Cas9 fused to a repressor93 have been used for the inactivation of enhancer chromatin down-regulating proximal genes. Importantly, RNA-mediated epigenetic regulation94 provides another path to alter gene expression.

From cou.: 15 Synthetic biology allows one to alter transcriptional regulation by activating or repressing gene transcription through transcription factors (TF) appropriately bound to DNA binding domains, the zinc-fingers, TALEs and CRISPR-Cas9 being the ones currently used. Several projects, such as the building of a library of orthogonal synthetic TF using artificial ZF,95 a library of TALE repressors that bind newly designed hybrid promoters69 or the coupling of a catalytically inactive dCas9 to a transcriptional repressor domain able to robustly silence expression of multiple genes, among others,86,96–98 show the great potential to alter regulatory networks. Moreover, optogenetic methods enable a dynamical control of this process.99

 ###### 
From cou.: 16 Control of gene expression can be also engineered at the post-transcriptional level. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have a relevant role in this process, as RNA modules are engineered to respond to several types of molecular inputs, such as small molecules, metabolites or proteins (i.e. aptamers). Ligand-responsive riboregulators enable post-transcriptional gene expression with an external control,100,101 while ribozymes and riboswitches have also shown direct implications for gene expression,102 becoming targets of synthetic modification at an ever-increasing rate. Programmable sensing-actuation devices have also been designed.67 Importantly, the engineering of RNA molecules is not limited to post-transcriptional regulators, as they display sensing, regulatory, information processing and scaffolding activities with great potential to reprogram cellular behaviour at other levels.103

From cou.: 17 Signalling networks can be rewired to change cellular responses to either endogenous67 or externally applied stimuli.68 This requires unraveling protein–protein interactions (PPI) with engineering prospects,104 or taking into consideration the problem of crosstalk to design and create orthogonal (non-crossreacting) protein–protein interfaces.105,106 Extracellular signals being transduced to the nucleus through a receptor's intracellular domain107 allow for a controlled behaviour at a nuclear level in a ligand-dependent fashion.108 Furthermore, directed molecular evolution can be a powerful tool to receptor design.109 On the other hand, engineered systems controlling protein splicing110–112 as well as optogenetic tools113 are being developed due to the regulatory opportunities they offer.

From cou.: 18 The final fate of a cell in a tissue is influenced by environmental interactions, which also participate in the self-organisation of tissues and organs. Most efforts within tissue-engineering have been focused on reproducing as reliably as possible the cellular microenvironment.116 Since the environment can be engineered in ways that are forbidden to real development, it provides a crucial element to expand our morphospace. A clear example involves the dimensionality of the environment. Cells cultured in a 3D microenvironment exhibit a gene expression profile, cell morphology and migration activity more similar to physiological conditions than cells of 2D cultures. The scaffolds or hydrogels used in such cultures are polymers that mimic the native extracellular matrix (ECM).117–120 Several studies have tackled this issue, achieving promising results.121–125 Appropriate scaffold designs can improve diverse conditions affecting cell viability, stem cell differentiation and cell migration.126–129

From cou.: 19 Using the correct mix of progenitor, ES or iPS cell cultures in the appropriate 3D context and biochemical conditions, a 3D structure similar to physiological tissues emerges, with self-organisation playing a critical role in this process. The resulting so-called organoids resemble real organs and can even display some of their characteristic functions. Several organoids resemble organs originating from the ectoderm, such as optic cups,40 storable stratified neural retina,42 polarised cortical tissue,130 cerebral cortex131 and inner ear.132 On the other hand, we find organoids recreating digestive system organs, such as the human liver,133 intestinal tissue134 and crypt villus structures,135 gastric tissue136 and pancreas,137 aimed at modelling human disease. Embryonic kidney structures have also been developed.138 Although the potential of building organoids represents a major advance, some of them lack key cell types and others do not progress beyond an early developmental or embryonic stage in culture,133,138 although some can progress in development after in vivo implantation.139,140

From cou.: 20 A very important advance has been provided by microfluidic devices and micropatterning148 to control the microenvironment, creating stable molecular gradients and flows149,150 and allowing cell compartmentalisation.151,152 They provide a repertoire of possible environments way beyond the natural counterparts.153–155 A major outcome of microfluidics is provided by the so-called organs-on-a-chip.156–158 The cells cultured inside the chip are monitored by the digital components that control the inflow of nutrients, gases or chemical signals, overcoming the limitations of the conventional 3D culture.159 They allow reproducing the biology of organs and the analysis of their responses under highly controlled conditions.160–162

From cou.: 21 A final approach to engineering organs while preserving some key structural constraints is to keep their original extracellular matrix. These decellularised organs provide a cell-free scaffold,163 guiding cells into the desired organ structure.

From Soup: 21 A final approach to engineering organs while preserving some key structural constraints is to keep their original extracellular matrix.

From cou.: 22 The idea that synthetic biology should take advantage of the self-organising properties is supported by different approaches. The field of morphogenetic engineering,185 for example, explicitly considers the self-formation capabilities of biological systems and how they can be integrated with technological design. In similar lines, the work by Liu et al.186 showed that E. coli cells can be engineered to form periodic stripes, being one of the few examples of an engineered self-organised process in synthetic biology. Interestingly, there is a lack of similar examples involving engineered mammalian cell lines. On the other hand, self-organisation plays a decisive role in many of the approaches used in tissue engineering when trying to build organ and tissue-level structures. However, this is achieved without proper control on the cellular behaviour, as all the currently used techniques rely on the natural cellular developmental programs, resulting in a field still dominated mostly by a trial and error strategy.187

From cou.: 24 Some studies have already shown the potential of genetically modifying cells in a tissue engineering framework. Notably, several studies addressed the problem of proper engraftment of cells in composite tissue matrices.115,196–198 The proposed solution involves using a gene activated matrix (GAMs), which consists of a matrix with associated DNA vectors, which are slowly released and delivered into reparative cells (see Fig. 4c). By expressing the transgene, the infiltrating cells enhance migration and promote differentiation. The safety and efficiency of printing DNA vectors in GAMs for transfecting target cells surpasses the benefits of direct delivery of growth factors. Protein–protein interactions designed for synthetic switches in mammalian cells199 have been successfully used to control the release of drugs from hydrogels.200 For example, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) loaded into the hydrogel can be released in a dose-dependent manner by oral administration of the trigger compound,201 opening new interesting avenues for research and therapy.

However, we are here addressing the problem of the possible and the actual and the definition of a space of organs and organoids. And there is no reason to only build organs and tissues as they exist in nature. Novel organs that can still perform, but also expand, the functions of their natural counterparts can be envisioned. Such enhanced physiology could entail including completely new functions or even the capacity to diagnose and cure diseases. This perspective no longer remains in the domain of speculation.202 Similarly, the fusion of organic and electronic systems has also drawn a great deal of attention. The first steps towards cyborg organs have already been undertaken. A striking example is the bioprinted bionic ear integrating chondrocytes in alginate along with printed silver nanoparticles in the form of an inductive coil antenna.203 Bioprinting organs to provide electric power, which is inspired by the myogenic electric organ that fish use to produce electric fields to communicate, navigate or defend themselves,204 could be a reality in a near future. Such novel electric organs could be used in humans as batteries for pacemakers and cochlear implants or as a source of power for prosthetic devices.205 It is likely that the advances in genome editing will be the key to create these ‘human-fish’ cells.

Starting from a mixture of cells (Fig. 5b) that can be part of a given organ or belong to completely different, even engineered, cell types, a final stable configuration (Fig. 5d) forms. This particular spatial assembly would be located close to the right, low corner of the front face of our space (see below). The axes of Ω should be taken as abstract dimensions that allow us to locate our candidate systems. Here we define three basic axes:

From cou.: 31 Following the standard approach of evolutionary morphospaces, the way (and how much of) this space of the possible is filled can reveal relevant features of the generative potential of these structures. It can also help to define the common features displayed by natural systems and explore the potential constraints placed on them. We should note that, in the morphospace proposed here, the location of objects in each axis is not quantified, although we will comment on this problem and potential approximations for each axis. However, it is worth mentioning that other studies involving these spaces often rely on statistically aggregated quantities, such as principal components. On the other hand, some well defined regularities can be established even when the morphospace is a purely qualitative one, as for example done in relation to cellular computation.206 More importantly, each of the examples discussed here can be easily ordered relative to each other within a given axis. Moreover, although the axes are not fully orthogonal (as it happens also with many other case studies), they contain clearly different qualitative features that justify their status as morphospace “dimensions”. Let us consider each one separately.

From cou.: 32 This axis provides a way of ordering our systems from simple mixtures of unrelated cells to fully developed organs. Intuitively, a bioreactor provides the bottom line of minimal complexity, while fully formed structures resulting from embryogenesis would be located at the other side of the spectrum. The presence or absence (and degree) of developmental processes implies the existence of different levels of dynamical organisation and feedback controls, including size and form.207 This property is sometimes maintained in the adult organism as exemplified by the human liver, which adapts its size in case one of the lobes becomes damaged or even in the event of transplant to a host of different body mass, recruiting either processes of growth or apoptosis accordingly.208 In our organ space (Fig. 5a) we can see that systems with low scores in this axis include printed organs and cell sorting-related cell assemblies. Both typically involve some amount of differential adhesion, which is a mechanism also used in most other solid systems inhabiting the right face of the space.

From cou.: 33 Developmental complexity includes both the presence of a developmental program (that is completely or partially unfolded) and the resulting structural complexity at the steady state. Several complexity measures can be defined, and in biology they need to take into account cellular and functional diversity. Simpler measures of complexity have been used210–212 and good candidates should take into account both spatial and temporal complexity. The number of different transcriptome profiles (considering coding and non-coding RNAs)213 or, alternatively, the amount of configurations a gene regulatory network can adopt214 could be used for such a measure. If we only attend to morphological complexity, the number of cell types of a multicellular system could be the simpler candidate215–217 but more adequate measures should account for the presence of multiple scales and hierarchy.218 A simpler but more complete measure could be to take into consideration the spatial distribution that the different cells can adopt, measured as the mutual information between cell types in a positional lattice.219 Regarding cell lineages, they could also be used as a measure of developmental complexity.220–223 On the other hand, the use of Waddington's developmental epigenetic landscape224 could also provide ways of incorporating a quantitative measure combining both cell diversity and cell lineages (see Fig. 6a).

From cou.: 34 The second axis introduces a well known concept from physics: states of matter, here reduced to two of them (solid and liquid). Matter can exist in multiple phases depending on external parameters like pressure or temperature. The main differences between these phases can be found in the mobility of the elementary particles and the mean distance between them. These are also related to how frequently and strongly the molecules conforming a material do interact among each other and, indirectly, how stable these pairwise interactions will be. In a biological setting (Fig. 6b) organs and tissues can also be characterised by different degrees of mobility in their constituent elements, with cells in the place of molecules. Biological assemblies of course differ from these physical systems, since they are far-from equilibrium structures, display cell turnover and heterogeneity and typically belong to a nested hierarchy of systems. On the one hand, typical solid organs like heart, lungs or kidneys display fairly static cell configurations and accordingly stable neighbourhoods of interacting cells. As we can see in our space, most relevant examples fall in the right wall of the cube. Blood on the other hand can be more readily mapped to a liquid phase. But despite the differences, several studies on the collective behaviour of multicellular assemblies clearly indicate that the physical analogies with states of matter are correct225–227 and in some cases it is even possible to properly define the phases of tissue spreading in aggregates with varying adhesion parameters.228 Because of the presence of universal behaviour, it is also possible to define rigorous measures associated to the phase state.

From cou.: 35 What can be found in the middle of these two potential extremes? On the one hand, although we have located the immune system (strictly speaking it is not an organ) as a member of the “liquid” wall, it provides a potential example for an intermediate liquid–solid scenario, since the immune cells are known to undergo a complex development that involves their circulation in blood but also a maturation process in specific tissue locations. In general, the vast majority of tissues and organs (Fig. 5a) belong to the “solid” boundary (the right wall of Ω) and this might be a consequence of the way development proceeds, instead of a truly strong constraint. We will discuss this particular point below.

From cou.: 36 Our third dimension involves the information processing capabilities displayed by different organs and organoids. This axis is connected to the complexity exhibited by these systems as computational structures (Fig. 6c). Here the key idea is that organs and organoids should be also considered as cybernetic systems incorporating the three elements of any homeostatic structure: sensors, comparators and actuators.229,230 Sensing components provide the connection with the external world. This information (sometimes after a digital transformation through cooperative molecular mechanisms) is then internalised and used to evaluate the state of the system (the comparator plays this role). Finally, a response is generated by the actuators, often creating a feedback loop that restores previous states.

From cou.: 37 We use the term cognition as a general form of introducing different levels of information processing. Organs operate in a distributed fashion, since they consist of many components (ECM or cells) that interact locally to provide a global function. This computation is highly dynamic, as the components are continually being created, self-arranged and destroyed.231–233 For a lower cognition system, these self-sustaining cell cultures exhibit no particular class of behavioural response beyond cell maintenance. At the other end of the spectrum, the immune system or the brain is able to process information from multiple sources, using very rich loops involving multiple scales (upper right corner in Fig. 5a). For instance, the immune system detects and responds to either new or previously experienced threats, while at the same time it is a highly dynamical system (new lymphocytes are constantly being created and destroyed). On the other hand, the brain is able to process an astonishingly wide spectrum of sensory information. Plasticity is a striking feature of the brain,234 being able to create new connections and reinforce them.

From cou.: 40 One of the most interesting features of Ω is the presence of a large void (Fig. 5a). Natural biological systems occupy the upper part of Ω, most on the right side associated to solid structures and resulting from embryogenesis. We have also included, close to this upper boundary, insect colonies, which are also known to display some traits closely related to developmental processes.240,241 This is an interesting example, given their combination of a “fluid” phase, associated to mobile, interacting agents, and a stable scaffold (the solid phase) given by the nest structure. Actually, the nests of army ant colonies are made of the living bodies of individuals, forming a large ball where ants attach to neighbours by holding onto each other's legs.242 In most ant colonies there is a constant interaction (particularly through its development) between both phases, which would include both a static, solid scaffold (the next structure) and a “fluid” phase constituted by the ants. This reminds us the ways bone structures are built and rebuilt by the interactions between the solid scaffold and the cells occupying it. These similarities could provide new perspectives within the context of synthetic biomaterials.243

From cou.: 41 We also have included in our morphospace two additional examples that occupy a special place. These correspond to the microbiome and the slime moulds belonging to the genus Physarum. The first example is very relevant within our discussion, since it defines a complex multicellular assembly that cannot be considered either liquid or solid, and displays some level of cognitive complexity.244 Its developmental complexity is connected to an ecological assembly process where a network of mostly cooperative interactions maintains its species diversity and stability.245Physarum on the other hand is a very interesting case study that deviates from the rest in several ways. It is a unicellular structure that achieves a macroscopic spatial organisation and is capable of remarkable computational tasks.246 Despite its lack of multicellular complexity, it does experience a predictable developmental process and its enormous plasticity locates the system in a state that can be identified as “solid” but with an internal fluid structure. Since it is highly plastic and adaptive, it cannot be classified as solid or liquid, but it does experience a developmental process and has a small cognitive complexity.

From cou.: 42 The previous examples depart from the standard biological architectures. Does this suggest that organs cannot fill parts of this empty space? We can argue that organisms are final-state outcomes of development and that the unfolding of information through differentiation and proliferation events occurs in a spatial context defined by the changing embryonic boundaries. This process needs to be regulated and under several controls that guarantee, in particular, that organ size and integration occur in the right sequence. Through this process, we could say that the physical plasticity of developing organs varies through time, thus transiently occupying parts of the void within Ω. The clever solution to maintain the right order of events and a robust final outcome is to create modular structures (organs) that can develop separately from others within spatially localised domains while interact with the whole system in order to achieve a proper integration. It is thus likely that fluid or partially fluid organs are not expected to be common. But one way of engineering alternative organs might involve redesigning organ-specific functionalities into a fluid (liquid) system or perhaps creating hybrid systems combining both phases.

From cou.: 43 Different potential scenarios can be considered as tentative ways of moving away from the natural locations of the examples shown in Fig. 5a. As a first example, imagine that we want to engineer an endocrine gland aimed to deliver a natural or a synthetic hormone into the bloodstream. Is there a real need for a solid and thus spatially located gland? Why not “liquefy” the gland into single cells that can travel in the blood? In theory, this distributed gland would be able to perform the required function if the cells are able to properly sense the triggering signal (i.e. high glucose) and secrete in response the desired amount of hormone (i.e. insulin). To engineer those cells, we have to consider the level of the cognitive complexity of the design required to ensure the maintenance of the system's homeostasis, since the extent of oscillations within the healthy values depends on the strength of control of the (information) feedback and the dynamics of the response. Pursuing with the pancreas example, the blood glucose levels should remain within a well-defined range, and these limits should not be overstep either in fasting or after eating. If our engineered cells must only sense the high levels of glucose in the blood or they have to also take into account early warning from metabolic hormones, and if an active shooting system is required, further engineering might be required.

From cou.: 44 A second example could be engineering micro-organs obtained from cell sorting processes leading to a multilayered system. We have already mentioned this kind of structure, which actually defines the lower level of complexity of organoids. These spheroids can then be engineered to perform artificial computations by designing a set of sensors and actuators that can be distributed between the internal and the external layer. These spheroids could easily incorporate decision-making circuits, thus moving towards the high cognitive complexity wall. Such increased cognition would make closer to organoids and can be achieved by using non-standard computational engineering, such as so-called distributed multicellular computation (DMC)247 where a given functionality is defined through a Boolean table. The different parts of the computation can be distributed over different cell types with no need for communication among different engineered cells. This allows one to easily and reliably build a class of organoid computations where we can exploit both DMC and spatial modularity248 to increase the computational capacity of these simple multicellular aggregates. This also helps to store information and thus create a micro-organ with memory potential.

The microbiome defines a powerful layer of living complexity that has co-evolved with our bodies and that interacts closely with our cells.249 A plethora of candidate microorganisms can be used to engineer synthetic interactions with their host organs and thus obtain a novel system that once again gets located within the empty domain of Ω. Such hybrid system can include on the one hand a target organ and, on the other, the spatially less defined population of the chosen microorganisms.

From cou.: 46 All these possibilities are open to serious inspection and are promising ways of finding potential, novel solutions to existing problems. But again we must remember that the lack of real systems occupying the void might also indicate intrinsic difficulties. Future work should allow one to find out whether developmental constraints are the cause of this empty space of designs (and thus we can exploit the many open possibilities it opens) or instead such designs are suboptimal or forbidden solutions. In this context, the use of mathematical and computational models offers alternative ways of searching for answers and explore tentative designs. If organs only visit this domain transiently during their development, this can also be due to the stabilising role played by spatially patterned interactions.252 In this context, it would be important to develop a theoretical understanding of our morphospace that includes other factors beyond the ones covered by our chosen axes. Just to mention an example, it has been shown that the spatial organisation of some tissues (such as the colonic crypts) can provide tumour suppressor properties.253 If designed organoids have to be designed for long-term interactions within their host organisms, this type of properties should be taken into account.

From cou.: 47 Experimental exploration of developmental processes has been widely successful in identifying the key events and genes underlying the construction of form. However, the in vivo approach has been usually constrained by the impossibility of modifying several variables or genes at a time while keeping track of the consequences and generate organised knowledge. High-throughput experiments allow the modification of multiple variables but again one by one, using an essentially reductionistic approach that remains largely oblivious to the higher order interactions of genes and their epistatic relations. Fortunately, a complementary approach exists in the use of computer assisted research, particularly in the formulation of theoretical models that allow the systematic analysis of complex variables and landscapes. This approach naturally complements experiments by providing new predictions that can be validated in experimental setups. The power of simple models has been widely proved by models involving differential adhesion, a phenomenon that we have already discussed above. As early suggested by Steinberg, the spontaneous dynamics associated to cell sorting and the formation of spheroids and other types of organ-like structures can be described by an energy minimisation process.141,142 Given its importance and widespread use to model a wide range of developmental processes, it is worth briefly presenting it.

From Soup: 65 Steinberg's model and other related efforts towards understanding and predicting the formation of simple organoids support the idea that simple models not incorporating the low-level molecular interactions can help to gain insight. Moreover, the model can be expanded in multiple directions, by incorporating (in particular) the three levels of complexity associated to the three axes of our morphospace. By increasing the temperature, for example, we can shift from a well-organised (solid) spheroid to a disordered (liquid) mixture. By incorporating additional components involving phenotypic transitions, a much richer spectrum of structures can be obtained. Finally, as we discussed in the previous section, simple and complex computational synthetic circuits can be added in order to introduce learning or adaptation to increase cognitive complexity. Some of the models discussed below rely precisely on adding other components to the original model. Here we present a few examples of theoretical avenues that can be followed to explore and predict potential outcomes of designed or evolved organs. They have been selected according to their relevance with the three axes previously described, outlining several theoretical approaches that can be useful in the exploration of new possibilities.

In this vein, Hogeweg et al. 255 analysed the interplay between developmental mechanisms in virtual embryos. The subjacent hypothesis is that there is a natural drive for organisms to become more internally diverse. The results show that, despite no explicit search for particular spatial arrangements or specific developmental programs, morphogenetic behaviours appear as a side effect of selecting for cell heterogeneity, with the remarkable establishment of engulfment, budding and intercalation among others. A wide variety of ‘life-like’ forms similar to those observed in development were reported ( Fig. 8a ) offering new insights into the discussion of the role of complexity in development. This strategy has also been put forward in other studies, 266 obtaining interesting results that connect the evolution of complex patterns of gene expression and developmental toolkits: once a threshold of genetic complexity is achieved, the number of accessible patterns explodes.

From Soup: 68 Regarding the interplay between physical properties and developmental processes, several examples can be found (from growth rates to cellular shapes) where the regulated recruitment of physical forces acts as a morphogenetic driver. 145 Albeit generally controlled by the expression of one or multiple genes, they introduce relevant epigenetic interactions beyond the gene level, key to the establishment of functional structures. In particular, one of the most well documented examples, also related to our proposed liquid–solid dichotomy, is the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (hereafter EMT) 256,267 ( Fig. 8b ). EMT is a reversible transdifferentiation process by which cells in the primitive streak, the endocardial cushion and the heart valves among others switch back and forth between more mobile and more adhesive phenotypes. This prompts the reorganisation of cell distribution, linked to an appropriate functionality in the mentioned structures, 256 but also related to tumour progression and invasion. 268 Models of metastasis exploring the cell fate landscape have shown that cancer cells can make use of mixed phenotypes with epithelial and mesenchymal properties, 269 a feature that was previously observed in experimental systems. 270

It is well known from Dictyostelium biology that, in the face of starvation, the solitary amoebas aggregate and form a collective structure composed of multiple cell types with the purpose of creating resistance forms (spores) and disseminating them. When trying to model this process, the authors introduced in different cell types a specific function (either stalk or spore forming) and a differential adhesion pattern between them. This simple mechanism was shown to be of utmost importance in maintaining the general spatial relations between structures of the fruiting body when appropriately regulated. Moreover, the physical properties of the virtual cells and their environment were also modulated by an extracellular matrix, enabling the self-organisation and self-correcting behaviour of the fruiting body formation.

From Soup: 71 Hofmeyr and Forrest described the architecture of an artificial immune system (AIS) able to solve the network intrusion detection problem in broadcast local-area networks (LANs), 257 of practical significance in network security. Natural immune systems are diverse, distributed, dynamic, self-protecting and adaptable, and these properties were taken as basic design principles to build a robust artificial distributed adaptive system. Broadly speaking, the AIS consists of a protected computer system ( self ) and infectious agents ( non-self ), which are both represented by dynamically changing sets of bit strings. These are continuously processed by detector programs that incorporate properties from different cells of the immune system. During the lifecycle of a detector ( Fig. 8c ) a negative selection process takes place, filtering some immature detectors in order to avoid autoimmune reactivity . Once a detector has survived the negative selection process it can become activated by means of presentation of non-self bit strings and human co-stimulation. This way, a memory of interaction is created and the threshold for further non-self detection is lowered. This constitutes a compelling example of how to implement a useful, cognitively complex process that is inspired by a natural system. Moreover, it lays the groundwork for further inquiry into artificial distributed information-processing.

From Soup: 72 A central theme in our paper is the presence of constraints that can be unavoidable while dealing with living tissues and organs, where structural constraints might sometimes play a role that cannot be reduced to gene regulatory paths. This does not mean that we are necessarily limited in engineering complex cellular structures, and the existing literature on synthetic biological designs is a success story. What we try to highlight here, however, is the need for considering the potential constraints associated to the system and organ-level of organisation. As we discussed above, evolution very often displays a surprising level of convergence, thus indicating that the same solutions are generated independently through different paths. Many examples of this process, taking place in different species often separated in both space and time, can be provided. These include among others light-producing organs in squids, 272 electric organs in teleost fish, 273 neural circuits underlying communication and speech 274 and even technological networks. 275,276 Convergence is an indication of a limited repertoire of design rules and, more importantly, the existence of limitations to what can be achieved using a bottom-up, standard engineering perspective. That includes both evolved and designed systems. The presence of constraints often implies a top-down causality that might be difficult (or even impossible) to modify. Bottom-up designs will succeed provided that they are capable of exploiting modular properties of the organ/organoid, thus avoiding unexpected or undesirable effects.

From Soup: 73 In this article we have reviewed some of the most recent advances in the fields of synthetic biology and tissue engineering, with the intent of exploring how far we could go in designing new non-standard organs. With that purpose, we address the idea that self-organising principles, a keystone component in tissue engineering, should be viewed as an advantage (instead of an obstacle) by synthetic biologists. These self-organisation principles are consistently used to obtain organ-like structures or organoids, 24 exploiting the natural tendency of cells to differentiate and spatially arrange themselves in an orderly manner. These designed forms could potentially open the door to new functionalities, but also offer invaluable information regarding the evolutionary potential that current structures bear (in the same way that Alberch's monsters do). Guidance to explore the generative landscape of organ design can be found in our proposed morphospace ( Fig. 5 ), where we show that some regions remain underpopulated.

From Soup: 74 The morphospace of organs and organoids presented here provides a unifying picture of the known universe of possible structures. In this simplified universe of possibilities, we have a populated area inhabited by known organs and some designed organoids. The limit cases are also obvious, but a large space of design is essentially (as far as we know) empty. These empty spaces in the maps of biological complexity require an explanation. What is the rationale for their presence? Their absence indicate either impossibility or simply that evolution within an embryogenesis context is unable to fill this space. But engineering deals with the exploration of what can be designed no matter whether evolution would allow that to happen. Understanding the nature of this void is also a way of interrogating nature about its generative potential, and might shed light on novel ways of designing organs beyond the natural counterparts.

These might be reached with current synthetic biology techniques, which really allow one to build novel designed morphologies.190,191,277,278

 ###### 
From cou.: 77 The morphospace of organs and organoids presented here provides a unifying picture of the known universe of possible structures. In this simplified universe of possibilities, we have a populated area inhabited by known organs and some designed organoids. The limit cases are also obvious, but a large space of design is essentially (as far as we know) empty. These empty spaces in the maps of biological complexity require an explanation. What is the rationale for their presence? Their absence indicate either impossibility or simply that evolution within an embryogenesis context is unable to fill this space. But engineering deals with the exploration of what can be designed no matter whether evolution would allow that to happen. Understanding the nature of this void is also a way of interrogating nature about its generative potential, and might shed light on novel ways of designing organs beyond the natural counterparts.

From Soup: 354 Each term in this matrix provides a measure of how likely is a given pair of contacts given the state of the two sites. For obvious reasons, the matrix is symmetric, = , and = 0. where is the set defined by the nearest neighbours of a cell in position each of which occupies a position , and has a defined state . If we try to swap one cell to one of its nearest locations, we first determine the new energy ′ using the same expression. The energy difference between the original and the new (potential) configuration is When the difference is negative, the cell is likely to swap to the chosen new position, whereas no such change should be expected if an increase in energy is at work. The probability associated to this is given by the so called Boltzmann rule: where the parameter is a noise factor tuning the degree of randomness associated to our model. It is easy to see that the Boltzmann factor e acts in such a way that if Δ = 0, the probability of swapping is 1/2. In we display three examples of the distinct spatial arrangements of cells obtained from this simple (but rather realistic) model. The relative weights of the matrix elements provide clues for what to expect in each case, and thus can be used as a guideline to predict some of the possible patterns that can result from a given engineering design associated to adhesion properties.
