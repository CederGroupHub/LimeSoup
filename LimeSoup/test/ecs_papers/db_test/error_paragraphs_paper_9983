from test: 0 The effect of SO2 content in air on degradation of a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF6428) cathode for solid oxide fuel cells was investigated at T = 1073 K for 24 h by setting the concentration of SO2 to 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 ppm. The degradation of the LSCF6428 cathode became more significant with increasing SO2 concentrations due to the increase of cathode polarization resistance. The SrSO4 formation was confirmed after exposing to SO2 from 0.1 to 100 ppm and became even harsh with increasing SO2 concentrations. The reaction sequence can be interpreted from thermodynamic considerations using chemical potential diagrams and chemical equilibrium calculations.

from test: 1 To extend applications of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), one major issue is to understand degradation mechanisms due to some contaminants; even in concentrations as low as parts per million (ppm) level, the contaminants can degrade the cell/stack performance, shortening then the cell/stack life. There are two major contaminants on the cathode side: chromium and sulfur.1 The chromium poisoning of cathodes, associated to the presence of metal interconnects has been well investigated. Several reports show degradation behavior and/or plausible mechanisms for chromium poisoning.2–8 For sulfur poisoning, however, only a few investigations have been made. It has been found that sulfur dioxide react with cathode materials and thus block the active sites for electrochemical reduction of oxygen, resulting in a considerable increase in cathodic polarization.9–13

from test: 2 In our previous studies, it was found that the sulfur poisoning effect was negligible for (La0.85Sr0.15)0.95MnO3 (LSM) because the SO2 adsorbed or reacted on the LSM surface can be easily desorbed. On the other hand, for Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (SSC) cathode, reaction with SO2 is more significant due to the high thermodynamic activity of Sr in SSC compared with LSM. The SSC cathode easily reacts with SO2 in air to form SrSO4, leading to a decrease in the cell performance.9,10 Lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) is also an important cathode material used in intermediate temperature SOFCs because it has high mixed electronic and ionic conductivities as well as a high catalytic activity for the O2 reduction reaction.14 For this reason, it is necessary to investigate the LSCF sulfur poisoning. In this work, we investigated the sulfur poisoning of LSCF6428 for different concentrations of SO2. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations were made to well investigate the electrochemical reaction in cathodes and to derive plausible degradation mechanisms as a function of SO2(g) concentration.

For the cell exposed to 0.1 ppm of SO2, the I/I0 value decreased slightly with exposed time. When SO2 concentration was increased from 0.1 to 1 ppm, the degradation rate increased, but the I/I0 value decreased with time. When the cell was tested in 10 ppm of SO2, the I/I0 value decreased rapidly at the beginning of the test, and further degradation ceased after a few hours, whereas the I/I0 value increased slightly. When the concentration of SO2 increased up to 100 ppm, the degradation rate became much faster and saturated around I/I0 = 50%.

from test: 5 Figure 2a presents the Nyquist plots of the ac-impedance spectra for LSCF6428 tested in 0.1–100 ppm of SO2 for 24 h. The observed impedance can be characterized in terms of two depressed semicircles. The equivalent circuits used to fit the impedance spectra are shown in Fig. 2b. The inductance (L) is corresponds to the inductive lines in the Nyquist plots. In addition to the ohmic contribution, we assume two semicircles characterized in terms of “constant phase elements” determined with resistivity (R), capacitance (C), and frequency. For the respective impedance spectra, these values were derived by fitting technique, which provides the changes of these quantities as a function of time. The relative variations of ohmic resistance (Re), high-frequency arc (RH), and low frequency arc (RL) respect to the initial values are plotted as a function of time in Fig. 3a,3b,3c, respectively. With increasing time, the values of Re, RL, and RH keep to be nearly constant for 0.1 ppm of SO2 and for gradually increase 1 ppm of SO2. When the SO2 concentration was 10 ppm, all resistances increased rapidly at the beginning, and followed by a gradual increase with time except for the [RH/RH(initial)] value, which did not keep increasing after the rapid degradation of the early stage. As the SO2 concentration reached 100 ppm, Re, RL increased rapidly at the early stage of testing followed by a slight change, while RH increased gradually.

Comparing Figs. 5a,5b, the grain surfaces became rough after testing in air for 100 h. A small amount of secondary phases was observed in the grain boundary region marked with an arrow in Fig. 5b. According to the analysis of EDX, these secondary phases were the Sr enriched perovskite. This SrO segregation in LSCF was considered to be the result of the mass transfer enhanced by the electrochemical reactions.

The EDX analysis showed that these phases were composed of SrSO4, suggesting that SO2 reacted selectively with the enriched Sr component in the grain boundary region to form the SrSO4 phase. As the SO2 concentration increased from 1 to 10 ppm, these SrSO4 phases increased in amount and clogged some partial open pores as shown in Figs. 5d,5e. The reacted region was extended from the grain surface to the whole grains with increasing SO2 concentration. For the 100 ppm SO2, initial grains split into several small grains as shown in Fig. 5f, indicating critical poisoning reactions in the LSCF6428.

from test: 8 In order to investigate the detailed process of poisoning reactions, we also analyzed the elemental distribution in the cross section of the LSCF6428 cathode exposed to 0.1, 1, and 100 ppm of SO2 by EDX. Results are shown in Figs. 6 to 8. As Fig. 6 shows, the edges of pores were partly enriched with Sr and S, indicating the SrSO4 formation along the grain boundaries. As the SO2 concentration increased to 1 ppm, the SrSO4 formation took place over whole grain surfaces as shown in Fig. 7. Notice also that Co enriched areas were detected. This suggests that Co-Fe compounds such as CoFe2O4 appeared inside the LSCF6428 cathode because of the depletion of the Sr component in the perovskite lattice. When the cell was tested in 100 ppm of SO2, shown in Fig. 8, almost the whole surface was covered with sulfate layers and also in the inside grains, SrSO4 (marked with A), Co–Fe phase (marked with B) and other kind of sulfate (marked with C) such as La2O2SO4, according to XRD results, were detected. This proved that the poisoning reaction extended from grain surface to the whole grain, and that the reaction mechanism changed.

 ###### 
from test: 26 i) The stability of SrMO3 (M=Co or Fe) component against the SrSO4 formation is about the same, although reaction products are different.
from Soup: 26 In Fig. 11 , the partial pressure of SO 2 (g) corresponding to 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 ppm is indicated by the horizontal lines. From the calculated results, reaction (I) should be almost completed for 0.1 ppm, while for 1 or 10 ppm, reaction (II) will be nearly completed. On the other hand, observed elemental distributions indicate that reactions proceed only in a limited area of surface or in a limited depth. This strongly suggests that kinetic factors such as diffusion or surface reaction rate should be rate limiting. For example, in reaction (I), the Sr component should diffuse up to the surface area to react with SO 2 (g) to form SrSO 4 . Actually, SrSO 4 was in many cases formed on the surface. For 0.1 ppm, SrSO 4 is formed only in a limited spot; this probably corresponds to those areas where the Sr component is concentrated during cell operation as shown in Fig. 5b . For 1 and 10 ppm, the SrSO 4 formation area is spread out over a whole surface area; even so, the surfaces are not covered by a continuous film of SrSO 4 , but there are two regions in the surface, SrSO 4 and a Sr depleted perovskite. It seems that the Sr component is segregated on reaction with SO 2 leaving the La-rich perovskite and CoFe 2 O 4 . In Fig. 7 , for example, SrSO 4 grew to rather larger grains, whereas a number of precipitates in small particles in the surface vicinity should be CoFe 2 O 4 . The matrix parts in which CoFe 2 O 4 exists should be the La-base perovskite. Notice that the SrSO 4 formation region extended inside the LSCF grains, suggesting that the SO 2 (g) gas or SO 4 2− ions can penetrate through the SrSO 4 grains to assist the growth of the SrSO 4 phase inside the LSCF grains. From these features, it is suggested that the SrSO 4 formation on the surface of LSCF prohibits kinetically further reaction of SO 2 to form La 2 O 2 SO 4 , providing a reasonable explanation for why the equilibrium reactions do not proceed. For the case of 100 ppm, the sulfur was observed deep inside LSCF grains. This indicates apparently La 2 O 2 SO 4 formation at different sites for those of SrSO 4 formation. From those elemental distributions, we can derive that Sr diffusion is faster than La, Co, Fe, while the sulfur component may have some diffusivity inside the formed SrSO 4 .
 ###### 
from test: 27 ii) The stability of LaMO3 (M=Co or Fe) against the La2O2SO4 formation is about the same.
from Soup: 27 The LSCF cathode has a large amount of oxide ion vacancies because the Fe 3+ , Co 3+ /Co 2+ ions are stable compared with the corresponding Fe 4+ and Co 4+ ions to exist in the perfect perovskite lattice. This provides a wider area of the electrochemically active sites in the cathode. 2 , 4 Therefore, the electrochemical reaction mainly occurs at the surface of those LSCF grains which are located near to the electrolyte/cathode interface. Oxygen molecule gas goes through the gas channel inside the cathode, reaches to such active sites, becomes adsorbed (O 2ads ) on grain surfaces, dissociates into adsorbed atoms (O ads ), forms oxygen ions (O 2− ) as a result of incorporation reaction with electrons, diffuses inside the LSCF grains, and finally transfers to the electrolyte at the cathode/electrolyte interface. In addition to these sequential electrode elemental processes, it should be noted that the distribution of actually active sites may change as progress of the reactions lead to local damage.
 ###### 
from test: 28 iii) The transition metal sulfate formation is different for Co and Fe; that is, iron sulfate is formed at higher partial pressures of SO2.
from Soup: 28 Based on the above processes, a simple sulfur poisoning mechanism shown in Fig. 12 can be proposed for cells tested in ( a ) 0.1 ppm SO 2 ; ( b ) 1 and 10 ppm SO 2 ; ( c ) 100 ppm SO 2 . When the SO 2 concentration is low (0.1 ppm) as shown in Fig. 12 ( a ), SO 2 (g) firstly reacts with the SrO component segregated at the grain boundaries to form SrSO 4 at the grain-grain-pore boundaries. Although some grain boundaries were covered with formed SrSO 4 , the rest of the surface remained without reaction. Thus, the R e , R L , and R H values almost remained unchanged, and therefore, the observed degradation was quite small because the electrochemically active area almost did not change on reaction. There were two possible contributions to the slight performance degradation:
 ###### 
from test: 29 For reactions of LSCF with SO2, calculated results are shown in Figs. 11a,11b. Here, LSCF6428 is represented as an ideal solid solution among various perovskite components. When SO2 is not present, LSCF6428 can be regarded as a mixture of (0.4LaFeO3 + 0.3SrFeO2.5 + 0.2LaCoO3 + 0.1SrFeO3). When SO2(g) is introduced, SrSO4 and CoFe2O4 are first formed. This is written down as follows:
from Soup: 29 The SO 2 adsorption on the LSCF cathode: The surface reactivity for the oxygen incorporation reaction is critical, so that plausible adsorption of SO 2 on the LSCF surface can lead to slight lowering in active area for the charge transfer process with high frequency, and also for the dissociation process of oxygen molecule to oxygen atoms with low frequency.
 ###### 
from test: 30 (I) p(LaCoO3) + 3p(SrFeO3−x) + 3SO2 + 0.5(1+3x)O2 = p(LaFeO3) + 3SrSO4 + CoFe2O4;
from Soup: 30 The SrSO 4 formation at the grain boundary: When the SrSO 4 formation takes place at the cathode/electrolyte interface; the electrode performance may be affected, while essentially no change can be expected when SrSO 4 was formed at boundaries apart from the cathode/electrolyte interface.
 ###### 
from test: 31 Here, p(LaCoO3) means the LaCoO3 component in the perovskite phase. At the respective equilibria with a selected amount of SO2(g), the equilibrium partial pressure of SO2(g) is given. In Fig. 11a, the equilibrium partial pressure of SO2(g) is plotted as a function of amount of SO2(g) involved in the respective equilibria, and also the reaction products are plotted in Fig. 11b. In Fig. 11c, the oxygen nonstoichiometry, d, strontium content and cobaltite content in the perovskites are indicated. From the reaction products shown in Fig. 11, other reactions can be written as follows;
from Soup: 31 For the case of 0.1 ppm, the changes in R e , R L , and R H values are negligible. Thus we can conclude that those changes in chemical features did not lead to any serious degradation within the period of test time.
 ###### 
from test: 32 (II) 2p(LaFeO3) + p(LaCoO3) + 1.5SO2 + 0.5O2 = 1.5La2O2SO4 + CoFe2O4;
from Soup: 32 With increasing SO 2 concentration (1, 10 ppm), shown in Fig. 12b , SO 2 reaction area extends further on the grain surface; the formed SrSO 4 covers the grain surfaces due to the Sr diffusion from inside to the surface. At the same time, CoFe 2 O 4 is precipitated inside the perovskite lattice and the remaining perovskite concentration approachs to that of LaFeO 3 . From the equilibrium point of view, the La component in the remaining perovskite can react with SO 2 (g) to form La 2 O 2 SO 4 . This suggests that the remaining perovskites are covered with a thin layer of La 2 O 2 SO 4 or the adsorbed SO 2 . On the surface, therefore, formed SrSO 4 covered a large area, whereas there remains the La-rich perovskite with fewer amounts of oxide ion vacancies in some areas. In such a circumstance, all contributions to the electrode reaction mechanism, that is R e , R L , and R H , may be affected. To make proper interpretation of reaction products distribution and cell degradation data simultaneously, plausible mechanisms for the degradation caused by the reactions with SO 2 (g) are first described below:
 ###### 
from test: 33 (III) 2p(LaFeO3) + SO2 + 0.5O2 = La2O2SO4 + Fe2O3;
from Soup: 33 Change in process with low frequency: This process of producing the adsorbed oxygen atoms should be taking place on the surface of the remaining perovskites. As shown in Fig. 5 , the surface of perovskite cathodes were significantly damaged for the 1 and 10 ppm cases. This feature corresponds well to the decrease in R L . Even in the early stage of contamination, the decrease was rapidly taking place. This suggests that the SO 2 (g) can be easily penetrated through the cathode layer into the electrochemically active zone and covered on those surfaces which act as electrochemically active sites.
 ###### 
from test: 34 (IV) La2O2SO4 + 2SO2 + O2(g) = La2(SO4)3
from Soup: 34 Change in process with high frequency: The charge transfer process on the grain surface was influenced by a decrease in the active surface area and also by a decrease in the number of the oxide ion vacancies. As shown in Fig. 11c , the concentration of oxide ion vacancies decreases with increasing the amount of reaction.
 ###### 
from test: 35 In regions (I)–(III), some components of the perovskite phase react with SO2 so that the composition of perovskite changes with the reactions.
from Soup: 35 Change in ohmic loss: Decrease in the number of the oxygen vacancies near the three phase boundaries should be also related to the decrease in the ionic conductivity along the ionic path associated with the electrochemical reactions. The ohmic resistance also increased because the electrochemical region must be extended to a more ascended area in order to compensate damaged areas in the cathode/electrolyte interface region, leading to a longer diffusion path of oxygen ions.
 ###### 
from test: 36 In Fig. 11, the partial pressure of SO2(g) corresponding to 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 ppm is indicated by the horizontal lines. From the calculated results, reaction (I) should be almost completed for 0.1 ppm, while for 1 or 10 ppm, reaction (II) will be nearly completed. On the other hand, observed elemental distributions indicate that reactions proceed only in a limited area of surface or in a limited depth. This strongly suggests that kinetic factors such as diffusion or surface reaction rate should be rate limiting. For example, in reaction (I), the Sr component should diffuse up to the surface area to react with SO2(g) to form SrSO4. Actually, SrSO4 was in many cases formed on the surface. For 0.1 ppm, SrSO4 is formed only in a limited spot; this probably corresponds to those areas where the Sr component is concentrated during cell operation as shown in Fig. 5b. For 1 and 10 ppm, the SrSO4 formation area is spread out over a whole surface area; even so, the surfaces are not covered by a continuous film of SrSO4, but there are two regions in the surface, SrSO4 and a Sr depleted perovskite. It seems that the Sr component is segregated on reaction with SO2 leaving the La-rich perovskite and CoFe2O4. In Fig. 7, for example, SrSO4 grew to rather larger grains, whereas a number of precipitates in small particles in the surface vicinity should be CoFe2O4. The matrix parts in which CoFe2O4 exists should be the La-base perovskite. Notice that the SrSO4 formation region extended inside the LSCF grains, suggesting that the SO2(g) gas or SO42− ions can penetrate through the SrSO4 grains to assist the growth of the SrSO4 phase inside the LSCF grains. From these features, it is suggested that the SrSO4 formation on the surface of LSCF prohibits kinetically further reaction of SO2 to form La2O2SO4, providing a reasonable explanation for why the equilibrium reactions do not proceed. For the case of 100 ppm, the sulfur was observed deep inside LSCF grains. This indicates apparently La2O2SO4 formation at different sites for those of SrSO4 formation. From those elemental distributions, we can derive that Sr diffusion is faster than La, Co, Fe, while the sulfur component may have some diffusivity inside the formed SrSO4.
from Soup: 36 For 1 ppm of SO 2 , all three terms increase linearly with time. For 10 ppm of SO 2 , in contrast, the poisoning reaction took place very fast and as a result, increase in those three terms was fast in the beginning and then became nearly constant after several hours, resulting in essentially the same R H and in a slight R L increase. This difference in time dependence between the high and the low frequency processes can be associated to the difference in species involved in the respective degradation; the low frequency process is largely influenced by coverage of poisoning species on the surface, while the high frequency process degradation is a result of the defect chemical change for electrons and oxide ion vacancies.
 ###### 
from test: 37 The LSCF cathode has a large amount of oxide ion vacancies because the Fe3+, Co3+/Co2+ ions are stable compared with the corresponding Fe4+ and Co4+ ions to exist in the perfect perovskite lattice. This provides a wider area of the electrochemically active sites in the cathode.2,4 Therefore, the electrochemical reaction mainly occurs at the surface of those LSCF grains which are located near to the electrolyte/cathode interface. Oxygen molecule gas goes through the gas channel inside the cathode, reaches to such active sites, becomes adsorbed (O2ads) on grain surfaces, dissociates into adsorbed atoms (Oads), forms oxygen ions (O2−) as a result of incorporation reaction with electrons, diffuses inside the LSCF grains, and finally transfers to the electrolyte at the cathode/electrolyte interface. In addition to these sequential electrode elemental processes, it should be noted that the distribution of actually active sites may change as progress of the reactions lead to local damage.
from Soup: 37 When the concentration of SO 2 increased up to 100 ppm shown in Fig. 12c , SO 2 started to erode the grain from its surface towards inside, and a new sulfate secondary phase La 2 O 2 SO 4 appeared besides SrSO 4 and CoFe 2 O 4 . This change in the reaction mechanism gave rise to a rapid increase in the ohmic process and in the low frequency process, whereas the high frequency process exhibited a linearly increasing degradation as total performance degradation. However, Fig. 1 shows that the SO 2 poisoning on LSCF was not catastrophic and about a half of the current was maintained even after the severe reactions with 100 ppm SO 2 (g). In view of this, the improving behavior with elapsed time in R H at 10 ppm SO 2 (g) seems to be of importance and interest. This strongly suggests that although it must be weak, some recovering process can operate against the poisoning process. 1
 ###### 
from test: 38 Based on the above processes, a simple sulfur poisoning mechanism shown in Fig. 12 can be proposed for cells tested in (a) 0.1 ppm SO2; (b) 1 and 10 ppm SO2; (c) 100 ppm SO2. When the SO2 concentration is low (0.1 ppm) as shown in Fig. 12 (a), SO2(g) firstly reacts with the SrO component segregated at the grain boundaries to form SrSO4 at the grain-grain-pore boundaries. Although some grain boundaries were covered with formed SrSO4, the rest of the surface remained without reaction. Thus, the Re, RL, and RH values almost remained unchanged, and therefore, the observed degradation was quite small because the electrochemically active area almost did not change on reaction. There were two possible contributions to the slight performance degradation:
from Soup: 38 LSCF, LSM, and SSC perovskite cathodes can be compared regarding in the thermodynamic activity of SrO and its relation to the reactivity with SO 2 (g). The SrO activity in these three cathodes increased in the direction LSM < LSCF < SSC. 9 , 18 In this sense, the SrO component and its thermodynamic activity in the perovskite cathodes determines the reactivity and resulting degradation due to SO 2 (g). Meanwhile, the appearance of an electrochemical recovery process seems to be a new feature in the sulfur poisoning. For more detailed understanding of the phenomena, this behavior will be carefully investigated in the future work.

from test: 41 For the case of 0.1 ppm, the changes in Re, RL, and RH values are negligible. Thus we can conclude that those changes in chemical features did not lead to any serious degradation within the period of test time.
from Soup: 41 SO 2 reacted with the Sr component to form SrSO 4 and to precipitate CoFe 2 O 4 . In addition, the remaining perovskite composition approach as to that of LaFeO 3 and the oxide ion vacancies seem to decrease in number.

from Soup: 44 Corresponding to changes in the chemical reaction scheme, the poisoning behavior of the LSCF cathode changed with elapsed time. Within the SrSO 4 formation region, the degradation proceed linearly with time and significantly with the concentration of SO 2 (g), while the degradation reached a steady state, suggesting that not only the poisoning process but also some improving process may take place.
