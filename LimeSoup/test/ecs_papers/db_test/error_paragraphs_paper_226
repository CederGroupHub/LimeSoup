from test: 0 The grain boundary electrical properties of high purity ZrO2 ceramic materials doped with 2, 3, and 8 mol % Y2O3, and 8 mol % Y2O3 co-doped with 0.4 mol % Al2O3 were studied in the temperature range of 200 to 500°C by electrochemical techniques and were theoretically analyzed. Although the presence of a siliceous phase is shown to be a major cause for the grain boundary blocking effect, the grain boundary properties appear to be significantly influenced by space charges, particularly in materials of high purity. The oxygen vacancy distribution and the grain boundary resistivity were calculated for 8 mol % Y2O3 doped ZrO2 by assuming double Schottky barriers, and the results were compared with the experiment. It is shown that reasonable space charge potentials lead to grain boundary effects which are consistent with the experimental features. In contrary to the bulk in which defect associates prevail (at temperatures <560°C), in the boundary regions, association effects can be assumed to be much less pronounced due to the vacancy depletion. © 2001 The Electrochemical Society.

from test: 1 ZrO2 (usually doped with Y2O3, CaO, or MgO) is at present the most important solid electrolyte, owing to its applications in technologically important devices, e.g., oxygen sensors (λ-probes) and solid-oxide fuel cells. In most of these applications, ZrO2 is present in polycrystalline form, because of the difficulty and expense associated with the fabrication of single crystals. Consequently, grain boundaries are a crucial part of the microstructure.
from Soup: 1 ZrO2 powders (quoted SiO2 content ∼50 ppm by weight) doped with 2, 3, and 8 mol % Y2O3 (denoted as 2YZ, 3YZ, and 8YZ, respectively) purchased from Tosoh-Zirconia (Tokyo, Japan), and Al2O3 powder with a purity of 99.992% purchased from Adolf Meller Company (Rhode Island, USA) were used. Some of the 8YZ powder was further doped with 0.4 mol % Al2O3 (denoted as 8YZA). All the powders were cold-isostatically pressed at 400 MPa into pellets, then sintered at 1650°C in air for 6 h. The sintered pellets were 9.0 to 9.5 mm in diam and 3.0 to 3.6 mm in thickness. After sintering, the 8YZ and 8YZA samples were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to be cubic, and the 3YZ samples to be tetragonal, but in the 2YZ samples small amount of the monoclinic phase was also detected.

from test: 2 ZrO2 grain boundaries exhibit a blocking effect with regard to the ionic transport across them.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 The specific grain boundary resistivity is frequently several orders of magnitude higher than the bulk resistivity. In ZrO2 materials of usual purities, the blocking effect has been largely attributed to the grain boundary siliceous phase.8 9 10 11 12 13 But even in high purity materials in which a siliceous phase was not observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM)4 6 14 the specific grain boundary resistivity was still found to be two orders of magnitude higher than that of the bulk. Therefore, an “intrinsic” grain boundary blocking effect seems to be present,4 the origin of which remains to be explained.
from Soup: 2 The microstructures were observed via scanning electron microscope (SEM) (type Stereoscan 420) on the polished and thermally etched surfaces, permitting the measurements of the average grain sizes. The impedance measurements were conducted with a Solartron 1260 frequency response analyzer in air in the temperature range of 200-500°C, and over the frequency range of 0.1 to 106 Hz at an amplitude of 100 mV. Silver paint was used to fabricate the electrodes. The paint was applied to the entire areas of both sides of the pellets and fired at 600°C for 1 h. The bulk, the grain boundary and the electrode contribution to the impedence were separated by fitting the complex spectra via the program ZView (Version 2.1b, Scribner Associates, Inc.).
 ###### 
from test: 3 A grain boundary consists of one grain boundary core and two adjacent space charge layers. The space charge layer thickness is characterized by the Debye length. The superposition of these to a brick layer ceramic was modeled in Ref. 15. Based on this concept, a grain boundary defect structure model16 was proposed for doped ZrO2, in which oxygen vacancy depletion and solute enrichment in the space charge layers were suggested. With this defect structure model some experimental results, e.g., the effects of trivalent oxides,17 and pentavalent oxides18 on the grain boundary resistivity, and the role of the grain boundaries in the low temperature degradation of tetragonal ZrO2 19 have been successfully explained. The oxygen vacancy depletion in the space charge layers was proposed as one of the causes for the grain boundary blocking effect since the early 1980s.6 16 20 21 22 23 And it has been well proven that the similar grain boundary blocking effects in acceptor-doped SrTiO3 24 25 26 are due to charge carrier depletion viz., oxygen vacancies and electron holes in the space charge layers.
from Soup: 3 Figure 1 shows the microstructures, typical of monophasic materials. The solubility limit of Al2O3 in ZrO2 sintered at 1700°C then cooled to room temperature was found to be about 0.5 mol %. 33 According to Ref. 34 and 35 , dissolved Al2O3 strongly segregates to the grain boundaries, and when sufficiently oversaturated, Al2O3 particles precipitate. The 0.4 mol % Al2O3 added in our experiments was obviously within the solubility limit, because no Al2O3 particles were observed in the SEM images (Fig. 1 b).
 ###### 
from test: 4 Because of its relatively large dielectric constant and very low dopant content, the Debye length of acceptor-doped SrTiO3 can be as large as tens of nanometers.24 25 In contrast, the dielectric constant of ZrO2 is smaller and a high dopant concentration is necessary to stabilize ZrO2. Hence, the Debye length of ZrO2 with a typical dopant level appears to be as small as 0.1 nm. Such a small space charge thickness makes the role of the space charge layers in the blocking effect questionable. However, several additional points must be noted.27
from Soup: 4 Typical impedance spectra for the samples 8YZ, 8YZA, 3YZ, and 2YZ at 250°C, and the equivalent circuit are given in Fig. 2 . As the constant phase elements instead of capacitances were used in the equivalent circuit, the capacitances ( C ) were calculated from C=(R1−nQ)1/n.
 ###### 
from test: 5 1. The actual space charge thickness is larger than the calculated Debye length. Indeed grain boundary thicknesses determined from impedance spectroscopy were reported to be in the range of 1.5 to 6.7 nm,4 28 depending on grain size, concentration and dopant type. The thickness of the disordered grain boundary structure (i.e., the grain boundary core) determined from TEM is only about 0.8 nm29 (i.e., δcore=0.8 nm). The combined thickness of two space charge layers may thus be in the range of 0.7 to 6.0 nm. Note however that an equivalence between the effective boundary thickness derived from impedance spectra and the space charge layer thickness does not necessarily mean that space charges are the decisive factor in the grain boundary resistance, this is due to the interdependence of core and space charge.30
from Soup: 5 Figures 3 a-d give the Arrhenius plots of the grain boundary and the bulk resistivities, measured for 8YZ, 8YZA, 3YZ, and 2YZ. The bulk resistivity was computed via ρb=RbA/L, from the bulk resistance (Rb), and the cross-sectional area ( A ) to the thickness ( L ) ratio of the samples. Similarly the specific grain boundary resistivity is ρgb=RgbAgb/nδgb, with Agb being the grain boundary area, δgb the grain boundary thickness, and n the number of grain boundaries to be trespassed in the measurement direction. The grain boundary resistance (Rgb) was obtained from fitting the impedance spectra, and Agb/nδgb can be calculated from the grain boundary capacitance Cgb=ɛ0ɛgbAgb/nδgb, which was also obtained from the fitting. Thus ρgb can be derived from the grain boundary relaxation time τgb=RgbCgb, if the grain boundary dielectric constant is known.
 ###### 
from test: 6 2. If the dopant concentration is frozen as probable in the temperature regime considered here, and does not follow the space charge field, the dopant profile is to a first approximation expected to be constant with regard to the local coordinate. (Note that at high temperatures at which cations are sufficiently mobile, the space charge width is negligible due to the high dopant concentration always involved in doped-ZrO2.) In this Mott-Schottky situation31 32 which allows a comparatively simple treatment, the screening effect is reduced, leading to an effective thickness which depends on the segregation effect and can be distinctly greater than the Debye length.
from Soup: 6 In a high resolution TEM (HRTEM) study 36 of a ZrO2 ceramic obtained from the high purity Tosoh-Zirconia powder used here, no continuous siliceous phase was observed at the grain boundaries, neither was silicon segregation, while yttrium segregation was always detected around the grain boundary plane (core). Therefore, the major difference between the bulk and the space charge layers is the yttrium enrichment in the space charge layers. However, the dielectric constant of the bulk (ɛb) calculated from the bulk capacitances of the samples is in the range of about 55±5, irrespective of the different yttrium concentrations, suggesting that the dielectric constant is quite concentration insensitive. This is in good agreement with the work by Kleitz et al. , 37 in which the dielectric constant of Y2O3 doped ZrO2 was found to be about 60, independent of Y2O3 content. The unknown dielectric constant of the grain boundaries (ɛgb) can thus be reasonably approximated by the bulk dielectric constant (ɛb). Therefore with τb=RbCb. The grain boundary resistivities presented in Fig. 3 a-d were calculated according to this equation.

from test: 7 In spite of numerous research works,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 27 28 29 the grain boundary blocking effect in ZrO2 ceramics is readdressed in the present work, however, with an emphasis on the role of space charges, which has, to a large extent, been previously ignored. Because of its high electrical conductivity and its popularity in SOFCs and oxygen sensors, Y2O3 -doped ZrO2 is, without the restriction of generality, analyzed for illustrative purpose.
from Soup: 7 Notwithstanding the high purity, the grain boundary blocking effect is still obvious in each sample, i.e. , the grain boundary resistivity is always two to three orders of magnitude higher than the bulk resistivity. At lower temperatures, the blocking effect is more pronounced (Fig. 4 ). The activation energy for the grain boundary resistivity of the sample 8YZ (∼1.16 eV) is slightly higher than that for the bulk resistivity (∼1.05 eV). The difference between the two activation energies increases with decreasing dopant concentration, mainly because of the marked decrease of the activation energy for the bulk resistivity. The minor Al2O3 addition in 8YZ hardly affects the bulk resistivity, while it drastically increases the grain boundary resistivity (Fig. 5 ), which should result from grain boundary segregation.
 ###### 
from test: 8 ZrO2 powders (quoted SiO2 content ∼50 ppm by weight) doped with 2, 3, and 8 mol % Y2O3 (denoted as 2YZ, 3YZ, and 8YZ, respectively) purchased from Tosoh-Zirconia (Tokyo, Japan), and Al2O3 powder with a purity of 99.992% purchased from Adolf Meller Company (Rhode Island, USA) were used.

from Soup: 8 In Fig. 6 a-d the temperature dependence of the grain boundary capacitance and the grain boundary thickness are demonstrated. The grain boundary capacitances are only weakly dependent on temperature, but significantly dependent on dopant concentration and grain size, similar as observed for Fe-doped SrTiO3. 24 For 8YZ, 3YZ, and 2YZ, the grain boundary thicknesses calculated from the capacitance are almost identical, around 4.7 nm at 500°C. However, the addition of Al2O3 to 8YZ increases the grain boundary thickness from about 4.7 to about 5.6 nm.

from Soup: 9 The siliceous phase is considered to be the most common cause for the grain boundary blocking effect. Its composition and properties change with type and amount of impurities in starting powders, sintering atmospheres and temperatures, and cooling rates. The grain boundary resistivity was thus observed to vary significantly under different conditions. The activation energy however, is quite insensitive to these factors: the activation energy for the grain boundary resistivity, for samples with same dopant concentration but different type and amount of impurities, as well as for samples sintered at different temperatures, mostly range from 1.08 to 1.16 eV, 13 which is only slightly higher than the activation energy for the bulk resistivity.
 ###### 
from test: 10 Figure 1 shows the microstructures, typical of monophasic materials. The solubility limit of Al2O3 in ZrO2 sintered at 1700°C then cooled to room temperature was found to be about 0.5 mol %.33 According to Ref. 34 and 35, dissolved Al2O3 strongly segregates to the grain boundaries, and when sufficiently oversaturated, Al2O3 particles precipitate. The 0.4 mol % Al2O3 added in our experiments was obviously within the solubility limit, because no Al2O3 particles were observed in the SEM images (Fig. 1b).
from Soup: 10 According to most TEM observations, 35 36 38 39 the morphology of the siliceous phase can be represented by a discontinuous second phase model. 2 13 In this model, an alternation of direct grain to grain contacts and contacts interrupted by the siliceous phase inclusions is assumed, with the covered grain boundary area depending on the amount, composition, and wetting properties of the siliceous phase for given sintering conditions. We thereby must distinguish between two parallel pathways: one through the direct contacts between grains and the other through the intermediate siliceous phase. The latter is of direct importance only for a very high coverage by the siliceous phase. In this case, the activation energy for the grain boundary resistivity should depend on the specific properties of the blocking phase. Chemically different siliceous phases should result in different activation energies. However, this contradicts experimental findings. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 28 29 40 Neither does the activation energy vary if chemically different siliceous phases are present, nor does it change if the siliceous phase is squeezed out. Badwal et al. 40 observed that the significant decrease of the grain boundary resistivity obtained in this way, left the activation energy for the grain boundary resistivity essentially unchanged. We therefore expect the ionic conduction to occur solely through the ZrO2/ZrO2 contacts, being determined by intrinsic effects (space charge effects, see below). The presence of siliceous phases essentially determines the fraction of such contacts. These contacts may alternate within the same boundary or from boundary to boundary.

from Soup: 11 The fact that the activation energy for the grain boundary resistivity is only slightly higher than that for the bulk resistivity and that the activation energy for the grain boundary resistivity is insensitive to the properties and to the amount of the siliceous phase also rule out the role of the siliceous phase as solute sink, setting the space charge potential.

from test: 12 Figures 3a-d give the Arrhenius plots of the grain boundary and the bulk resistivities, measured for 8YZ, 8YZA, 3YZ, and 2YZ. The bulk resistivity was computed via ρb=RbA/L, from the bulk resistance (Rb), and the cross-sectional area (A) to the thickness (L) ratio of the samples.

The grain boundary resistance (Rgb) was obtained from fitting the impedance spectra, and Agb/nδgb can be calculated from the grain boundary capacitance Cgb=ɛ0ɛgbAgb/nδgb, which was also obtained from the fitting. Thus ρgb can be derived from the grain boundary relaxation time τgb=RgbCgb, if the grain boundary dielectric constant is known.
from Soup: 12 One of the most commonly observed morphologies of the discontinuous siliceous phase is a pocket at triple points (Fig. 7 a), another is a lens between two grains (Fig. 7 b). The grain boundary conduction in both cases can be schematically represented by Fig. 7 c. The role of such kind of insulating sections in highly resistive grain boundaries has been discussed in depth in Ref. 41 . Note however that even in materials poor or even free of siliceous phases, the specific grain boundary resistivity is still two to three orders of magnitude higher than the bulk value. 4 6

The grain boundary resistivities presented in Fig. 3a-d were calculated according to this equation.
from Soup: 13 In 2 mol % Y2O3 -doped ZrO2, 42 the grain boundary enrichments of divalent and trivalent solutes were found to be significant, whereas enrichments of tetravalent and pentavalent solutes were not observed, indicating a negative space charge at the grain boundaries.

At lower temperatures, the blocking effect is more pronounced (Fig. 4). The activation energy for the grain boundary resistivity of the sample 8YZ (∼1.16 eV) is slightly higher than that for the bulk resistivity (∼1.05 eV). The difference between the two activation energies increases with decreasing dopant concentration, mainly because of the marked decrease of the activation energy for the bulk resistivity. The minor Al2O3 addition in 8YZ hardly affects the bulk resistivity, while it drastically increases the grain boundary resistivity (Fig. 5), which should result from grain boundary segregation.
from Soup: 14 According to the constancy of the electrochemical potential for mobile defects, the concentration Cj(x) of any dilute defect j with charge z in the space charge layer is where x is the distance from the interface between the grain boundary core and the space charge layer, at the interface x=0; Δφ(x) is the electrostatic potential referenced to the bulk, the curvature of which is related to the charge density and thus the defect concentration according to Poisson’s equation.
 ###### 
from test: 15 In Fig. 6a-d the temperature dependence of the grain boundary capacitance and the grain boundary thickness are demonstrated. The grain boundary capacitances are only weakly dependent on temperature, but significantly dependent on dopant concentration and grain size, similar as observed for Fe-doped SrTiO3. 24 For 8YZ, 3YZ, and 2YZ, the grain boundary thicknesses calculated from the capacitance are almost identical, around 4.7 nm at 500°C. However, the addition of Al2O3 to 8YZ increases the grain boundary thickness from about 4.7 to about 5.6 nm.
from Soup: 15 The yttrium grain boundary segregation factor in cubic ZrO2 has been determined to be around 2. 43 44 As usual composition measurement techniques ( e.g. , Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), scanning TEM (STEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), etc.) cannot distinguish between free and associated defects, this seemingly low value must actually correspond to a much higher charge effect, since in the bulk most of the yttrium is essentially associated. We also have to take account of the fact that the measurement did not resolve the core, but averaged it over a significant area. By polishing away the surface segregation layer and then annealing the samples at different temperatures for sufficiently long time, it has been proven that the yttrium segregation is almost frozen at temperatures below 1000°C, 43 44 while the depleted oxygen vacancy concentration in the space charge layers is expected to follow the temperature variation to much lower temperatures. Owing to the oxygen vacancy depletion, the charge density can be considered to be determined only by the yttrium content, the profile of which can be assumed to be horizontal as a result of the relatively small segregation factor. Solving Poisson’s equation under these conditions (Mott-Schottky approximation 31 32 ) results in where CY is the dopant concentration, and λ * is the thickness of the space charge layer, expressed by Note that the space charge capacitance is inversely proportional to λ * . λ is the Debye length, given by

from Soup: 16 Since we are evaluating the resistance perpendicular to the grain boundaries, we have to integrate the inverse of the oxygen vacancy concentration to obtain the effective space charge resistance. Using Eq. 2 and 3 we find (see Appendix)

from test: 17 According to most TEM observations,35 36 38 39 the morphology of the siliceous phase can be represented by a discontinuous second phase model.2 13 In this model, an alternation of direct grain to grain contacts and contacts interrupted by the siliceous phase inclusions is assumed, with the covered grain boundary area depending on the amount, composition, and wetting properties of the siliceous phase for given sintering conditions. We thereby must distinguish between two parallel pathways: one through the direct contacts between grains and the other through the intermediate siliceous phase. The latter is of direct importance only for a very high coverage by the siliceous phase. In this case, the activation energy for the grain boundary resistivity should depend on the specific properties of the blocking phase. Chemically different siliceous phases should result in different activation energies. However, this contradicts experimental findings.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 28 29 40 Neither does the activation energy vary if chemically different siliceous phases are present, nor does it change if the siliceous phase is squeezed out. Badwal et al.40 observed that the significant decrease of the grain boundary resistivity obtained in this way, left the activation energy for the grain boundary resistivity essentially unchanged. We therefore expect the ionic conduction to occur solely through the ZrO2/ZrO2 contacts, being determined by intrinsic effects (space charge effects, see below). The presence of siliceous phases essentially determines the fraction of such contacts. These contacts may alternate within the same boundary or from boundary to boundary.
from Soup: 17 The addition of Al2O3 to ZrO2 only slightly modifies the bulk defect structure ([Al2O3]≪[Y2O3]), so, for the samples 8YZ and 8YZA, the Debye lengths and the bulk resistivities should be the same. However, both the effective thickness (λ * ) and the space charge resistivity (ρgb) could be different. Equating Eq. 4 and 6 for 8YZ and 8YZA leads (λ*=(δgb−δcore)/2, the value of λ*|8YZ/λ*|8YZA can be obtained from Fig. 6 a and b, while the value of ρgb|8YZ/ρgb|8YZA is given in Fig. 5 ). Solving Eq. 7 and 8 , e.g. , for T =500°C, we obtain a space charge potential of 250±5 mV for 8YZ and 300±10 mV for 8YZA. The mean value of the Debye length (λ) of the sample 8YZ calculated from Eq. 4 is now about 0.53 nm. Replacing λ and λ * values thus obtained and inserting Eq. 3 into Eq. 2 , we get the oxygen vacancy profiles in the space charge layer of the sample 8YZ, which is shown in Fig. 8 . The oxygen vacancy depletion in the space charge layer is very obvious. The ratio of the grain boundary resistivity to the bulk resistivity at 500°C calculated from these results is in the range of 100 to 500, which is consistent with the experimental value (∼260). The vacancy depletion can thus be the cause for the grain boundary blocking effect in ZrO2 materials of high purity.
 ###### 
from test: 18 The fact that the activation energy for the grain boundary resistivity is only slightly higher than that for the bulk resistivity and that the activation energy for the grain boundary resistivity is insensitive to the properties and to the amount of the siliceous phase also rule out the role of the siliceous phase as solute sink, setting the space charge potential.
from Soup: 18 The Arrhenius plot for the bulk resistivity shows a curvature at about 560°C, i.e. , the activation energy at temperatures lower than 560°C is larger than that at higher temperatures, 6 45 46 47 while such a curvature does not exist in the Arrhenius plot of the grain boundary resistivity. The activation energy, Ea is defined as Ea=dlnρ/d(1/kT). Accordingly, differentiating Eq. 6 yields If dΔφ(0)/d(1/kT)=0, i.e. , Δφ(0) is temperature independent, the activation energy for the grain boundary resistivity should be larger by 2eΔφ(0)−kT than the activation energy for the bulk resistivity. For the sample 8YZ, 2eΔφ(0)−kT≈0.42 eV, which is in nice agreement with the high temperature situation (T>560°C), in which Eabulk=0.80 eV, 6 while Eagb=1.16 eV (this work). Yet, for the low temperature situation (T<560°C), Eagb−Eabulk (∼0.11 eV)≪2eΔφ(0)−kT. One possible cause for this poor agreement could be the last term in Eq. 9 , i.e. , the temperature dependence of Δφ(0). A similar discrepancy in the activation energy difference was also observed in SrTiO3, 48 and it was suggested that even a very weak temperature dependence of Δφ(0) is enough to account for the discrepancy.

The grain boundary conduction in both cases can be schematically represented by Fig. 7c. The role of such kind of insulating sections in highly resistive grain boundaries has been discussed in depth in Ref. 41.

from Soup: 19 So far, we neglected the effect of the defect association in Y2O3 -doped ZrO2. However, in the low temperature range we are referring to, the defect association is not negligible. In nondilute solutions, the formation of defect associates in the bulk at low temperatures is unavoidable, of which the curvature in the Arrhenius plot of the bulk resistivity is indicative. In Y2O3 -doped ZrO2, the most commonly considered defect associate is (YZr′VO••)•. More complex defect associates were also assumed, 49 50 and the formation of (YZr′VO••YZr′)x in 9 mol % Y2O3 doped ZrO2 was suggested by a positron annihilation study. 51 At temperatures lower than 560°C, defect associates prevail in the bulk of Y2O3 -doped ZrO2. 45

from test: 20 In 2 mol % Y2O3 -doped ZrO2, 42 the grain boundary enrichments of divalent and trivalent solutes were found to be significant, whereas enrichments of tetravalent and pentavalent solutes were not observed, indicating a negative space charge at the grain boundaries.
from Soup: 20 However, owing to the field effect and the depletion of oxygen vacancies (Fig. 8 ), the association should be negligible immediately at the grain boundaries. And the fact that a curvature does not exist in the Arrhenius plot of the grain boundary resistivity also suggests that the defects in the boundary regions are mostly free even at temperatures <560°C, in spite of the formation of defect associates in the bulk. Therefore, the charge density in the space charge layers which is a crucial term in the Poisson’s equation is roughly independent of the association in the bulk, meaning that the above equations are valid for both situations without and with the defect association.

from test: 22 The yttrium grain boundary segregation factor in cubic ZrO2 has been determined to be around 2.43 44 As usual composition measurement techniques (e.g., Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), scanning TEM (STEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), etc.) cannot distinguish between free and associated defects, this seemingly low value must actually correspond to a much higher charge effect, since in the bulk most of the yttrium is essentially associated. We also have to take account of the fact that the measurement did not resolve the core, but averaged it over a significant area. By polishing away the surface segregation layer and then annealing the samples at different temperatures for sufficiently long time, it has been proven that the yttrium segregation is almost frozen at temperatures below 1000°C,43 44 while the depleted oxygen vacancy concentration in the space charge layers is expected to follow the temperature variation to much lower temperatures. Owing to the oxygen vacancy depletion, the charge density can be considered to be determined only by the yttrium content, the profile of which can be assumed to be horizontal as a result of the relatively small segregation factor. Solving Poisson’s equation under these conditions (Mott-Schottky approximation31 32) results in where CY is the dopant concentration, and λ* is the thickness of the space charge layer, expressed by Note that the space charge capacitance is inversely proportional to λ*. λ is the Debye length, given by

 ###### 
from test: 23 Since we are evaluating the resistance perpendicular to the grain boundaries, we have to integrate the inverse of the oxygen vacancy concentration to obtain the effective space charge resistance. Using Eq. 2 and 3 we find (see Appendix)
from Soup: 23 3. The Schottky barrier model satisfactorily explains most grain boundary features of ZrO2 materials of high purity in the temperature range considered. A grain boundary space charge potential of about 250 mV was obtained for 8 mol % Y2O3 doped ZrO2, and the grain boundary resistivity calculated from this potential is comparable with the experimental value. At high temperatures ( e.g. , >1000°C), a Gouy-Chapman analysis may be more appropriate.
 ###### 
from test: 24 The addition of Al2O3 to ZrO2 only slightly modifies the bulk defect structure ([Al2O3]≪[Y2O3]), so, for the samples 8YZ and 8YZA, the Debye lengths and the bulk resistivities should be the same. However, both the effective thickness (λ*) and the space charge resistivity (ρgb) could be different. Equating Eq. 4 and 6 for 8YZ and 8YZA leads (λ*=(δgb−δcore)/2, the value of λ*|8YZ/λ*|8YZA can be obtained from Fig. 6a and b, while the value of ρgb|8YZ/ρgb|8YZA is given in Fig. 5). Solving Eq. 7 and 8, e.g., for T =500°C, we obtain a space charge potential of 250±5 mV for 8YZ and 300±10 mV for 8YZA. The mean value of the Debye length (λ) of the sample 8YZ calculated from Eq. 4 is now about 0.53 nm. Replacing λ and λ* values thus obtained and inserting Eq. 3 into Eq. 2, we get the oxygen vacancy profiles in the space charge layer of the sample 8YZ, which is shown in Fig. 8. The oxygen vacancy depletion in the space charge layer is very obvious. The ratio of the grain boundary resistivity to the bulk resistivity at 500°C calculated from these results is in the range of 100 to 500, which is consistent with the experimental value (∼260). The vacancy depletion can thus be the cause for the grain boundary blocking effect in ZrO2 materials of high purity.
from Soup: 24 4. Even though defect associates prevail in the bulk of Y2O3 doped ZrO2 at low temperatures (<560°C), oxygen vacancies are much less associated in the space charge layers, owing to the depleted oxygen vacancy concentration.
 ###### 
from test: 25 The Arrhenius plot for the bulk resistivity shows a curvature at about 560°C, i.e., the activation energy at temperatures lower than 560°C is larger than that at higher temperatures,6 45 46 47 while such a curvature does not exist in the Arrhenius plot of the grain boundary resistivity. The activation energy, Ea is defined as Ea=dlnρ/d(1/kT). Accordingly, differentiating Eq. 6 yields If dΔφ(0)/d(1/kT)=0, i.e., Δφ(0) is temperature independent, the activation energy for the grain boundary resistivity should be larger by 2eΔφ(0)−kT than the activation energy for the bulk resistivity. For the sample 8YZ, 2eΔφ(0)−kT≈0.42 eV, which is in nice agreement with the high temperature situation (T>560°C), in which Eabulk=0.80 eV, 6 while Eagb=1.16 eV (this work). Yet, for the low temperature situation (T<560°C), Eagb−Eabulk (∼0.11 eV)≪2eΔφ(0)−kT. One possible cause for this poor agreement could be the last term in Eq. 9, i.e., the temperature dependence of Δφ(0). A similar discrepancy in the activation energy difference was also observed in SrTiO3, 48 and it was suggested that even a very weak temperature dependence of Δφ(0) is enough to account for the discrepancy.
from Soup: 25 5. Additional siliceous phase is suggested not to alter the grain boundary conduction mechanism ( i.e. , transport across grain boundaries via double Schottky-barriers), rather to reduce these pathways by blocking the boundary area.
 ###### 
from test: 26 So far, we neglected the effect of the defect association in Y2O3 -doped ZrO2. However, in the low temperature range we are referring to, the defect association is not negligible. In nondilute solutions, the formation of defect associates in the bulk at low temperatures is unavoidable, of which the curvature in the Arrhenius plot of the bulk resistivity is indicative. In Y2O3 -doped ZrO2, the most commonly considered defect associate is (YZr′VO••)•. More complex defect associates were also assumed,49 50 and the formation of (YZr′VO••YZr′)x in 9 mol % Y2O3 doped ZrO2 was suggested by a positron annihilation study.51 At temperatures lower than 560°C, defect associates prevail in the bulk of Y2O3 -doped ZrO2. 45

from test: 27 However, owing to the field effect and the depletion of oxygen vacancies (Fig. 8), the association should be negligible immediately at the grain boundaries. And the fact that a curvature does not exist in the Arrhenius plot of the grain boundary resistivity also suggests that the defects in the boundary regions are mostly free even at temperatures <560°C, in spite of the formation of defect associates in the bulk. Therefore, the charge density in the space charge layers which is a crucial term in the Poisson’s equation is roughly independent of the association in the bulk, meaning that the above equations are valid for both situations without and with the defect association.
