from test: 0 The flux from a one-dimensional (1-D) artificial pit electrode corroding under a salt film was examined using experimental and modeling techniques. Finite element simulations showed that the flux at shallow depths was consistently lower than analytically determined calculations for 1-D Fickian diffusion. This deviation was due to a substantial contribution of the external hemispherical boundary layer to the overall diffusion length. Increasing the pit diameter resulted in a larger boundary layer, which in turn affected the flux characteristics to greater depths. Data from experiments and simulation converged with the theoretical 1-D calculations only when pit depths approached nearly ten times the pit diameter. The experimental data from this artificial pit study as well as data from related published work were observed to span the range bounded by the numerically simulated and the analytically determined flux predictions. Comparison with published pit stability phenomenology showed that only deep pits provided kinetic data based on the cation concentration gradient unadulterated by bulk chloride effects. Finally, this work also provided insight into the origin of the dependence of the measured repassivation potential with pit depth, contributing towards a quantitative framework relating the various critical factors governing pitting.

from test: 1 The stable growth of corrosion pits requires the presence of an aggressive chemistry at the corroding surface as characterized by a high metal chloride concentration and low pH.1,2 The conditions leading to the maintenance of such chemistry were mathematically considered by Galvele3 through an investigation of the steady state relationship between metal dissolution and mass transport4,5 out of a one-dimensional (1-D) pit. For the case of a 1-D pit, it was theoretically demonstrated that a minimum critical value of cation flux – expressed as the product of the current density and the pit depth, (i⋅x) – was necessary for the pit to maintain a critical chemistry and thus stably corrode. As such, should the product of the current density and the pit depth fall below this critical value, repassivation would set in due to the loss of the aggressive chemistry. Subsequent studies on stainless steel pitting referred to this parameter and equivalent relationships for other pit geometries as the pit stability product.6,7 This critical pit stability product (denoted (i⋅x)crit) has been employed as the anodic stability parameter to determine the maximum pit size that can be attained on a particular metal surface in a given corrosive environment.8–11

Moreover, Steinsmo and Isaacs provided evidence that calculating the diffusion coefficient based on activity coefficients results in a value much higher than attested to by experimental observations. 37 Furthermore, Ernst and Newman, 29 Jun et al., 36 and Woldemedhin et al. 27 have shown that modeling the transport characteristics of the 1-D pit corroding under a salt film purely as a diffusion-limited process with the value for D as reported by Gaudet et al. 14 approximates the experimentally observed results closely, particularly for bulk [Cl − ] lower than 4 M. Ernst and Newman 29 have noted that salt solubility affects mass transport more than D until the bulk [Cl − ] reaches 4 M; beyond this value, viscosity effects on D 19 are likely to influence mass transport synergistically with cationic chloride solubility. As for the effects of electromigration, the ohmic drop for a 1 mm deep pit corroding under a salt film ( i L = 0.1 A/cm 2 , average resistivity 6.7 Ω.cm a ) is calculated to be 67 mV. The ohmic drop in a 1-D pit corroding under a salt film has been shown by Laycock and Newman 25 to be independent of pit diameter. Also, studies by Novakovski and Sorokina, 38 and later by Isaacs 18 have shown that the majority of this potential drop occurs across the salt film, and the current in the pit is primarily regulated by diffusion. Therefore, in order to parse the effect of pit geometry on cation flux, diffusion has been considered independent of electromigration in this study.

These results were obtained by performing the simulation on the geometry described previously using values of 5.02 M for C sat 35 and 8.24 × 10 −6 cm 2 /s for D . 13 , 14 In Figure 3a , these simulations are compared with the analytically determined expectation of 1-D Fickian flux, calculated using the same values for C sat and D . A linear relationship between flux and the reciprocal of the pit depth is expected in the case of 1-D transport, as indicated in Equation 1 ; this is the line that describes the analytical 1-D flux in Figure 3 . It is evident from the plot that the numerically simulated flux deviates from the analytical calculation for shallow pits. This deviation decreases as the pit depth increases – pits of diameter 50 μm begin converging with the analytical 1-D flux for pits deeper than 300 μm and are indistinguishable from the latter once pits of depth close to 1000 μm are attained. A similar trend is observed for a pit diameter of 90 μm – the convergence to the theoretical line begins around depths of 400 μm and the simulated and analytical fluxes coincide for pit depths in the vicinity of 1000 μm. However, for the larger pit diameter of 1 mm, the simulated flux deviates greatly from the analytical calculations and begins to converge only once depths of nearly 5 mm are attained. Figure 3b illustrates this difference even more starkly with the simulated concentration profiles plotted along the pit depth for two 1 mm deep pits of different diameters. The numerically simulated result for the 50 μm diameter pit agrees very well with the analytical line, with the concentration at the pit mouth approaching zero. However, for the 1 mm diameter pit, the simulated results show that the concentration at the pit mouth has dropped to only around 30% of saturation (≈1.5 M), and therefore deviate from analytically expected behavior at these depths.

from Soup: 20 In Figure 7 , published high-throughput artificial pit experimental data 28 for 50 μm diameter artificial pits are juxtaposed with the numerically simulated flux as well as two analytically determined flux lines. The analytical Fickian calculations differ only in terms of the value of C sat used. The line with the higher slope utilizes the value of 5.02 M that results from observations by Isaacs et al. 35 based on the stoichiometric dissolution of the individual components of 18–8 stainless steel (Fe +2 , Cr +3 , and Ni +2 ), whereas the line with the lower slope adopts 4.2 M as C sat reported by Gaudet et al. 14 as well as by Ernst and Newman, 29 based on the assumption that saturated FeCl 2 approximates the behavior of the concentration at the pit base. The experimental data are observed to span the region between the simulated flux and the theoretical flux based on 5.02 M for shallow pits, and converge to the analytical line for deep pits (> 400 μm). It is seen that analytical calculations using C sat data from stoichiometric dissolution bound the experimental data for 316L stainless steel better than if only FeCl 2 were considered. This result concurs with previous work 28 on the dissolution kinetics of 316L and 17–4 PH stainless steel artificial pits, indicating the C sat value used in calculations needs to be based on stoichiometric dissolution. The experimental data obtained in this study from the different configurations considered were also found to be contained within the limits of scatter of the high-throughput data at all depths.

The analytical Fickian calculations differ only in terms of the value of Csat used. The line with the higher slope utilizes the value of 5.02 M that results from observations by Isaacs et al.35 based on the stoichiometric dissolution of the individual components of 18–8 stainless steel (Fe+2, Cr+3, and Ni+2), whereas the line with the lower slope adopts 4.2 M as Csat reported by Gaudet et al.14 as well as by Ernst and Newman,29 based on the assumption that saturated FeCl2 approximates the behavior of the concentration at the pit base. The experimental data are observed to span the region between the simulated flux and the theoretical flux based on 5.02 M for shallow pits, and converge to the analytical line for deep pits (> 400 μm). It is seen that analytical calculations using Csat data from stoichiometric dissolution bound the experimental data for 316L stainless steel better than if only FeCl2 were considered. This result concurs with previous work28 on the dissolution kinetics of 316L and 17–4 PH stainless steel artificial pits, indicating the Csat value used in calculations needs to be based on stoichiometric dissolution. The experimental data obtained in this study from the different configurations considered were also found to be contained within the limits of scatter of the high-throughput data at all depths.
from Soup: 21 This work presents a combined experimental and computational analysis of the effects of the pit depth on the measurement and evaluation of the pit stability parameter from artificial pit experiments from the perspective of 1-D mass transport. Possible effects of convection and corrosion products on the 1-D flux are taken into account, before parsing the results to elucidate the effects of the external boundary layer on mass transport with pit depth and diameter. Artificial pit data in the literature are considered to rationalize the effect of bulk [Cl − ] on pit stability in addition to pit depth. Finally, the observed behavior of repassivation potential on pit depth is quantitatively explained in the context of steady state 1-D transport, using the results of this study.

from Soup: 22 The results of artificial pit experiments performed with configurations designed to examine the effects of both natural and forced convective flow, demonstrated that these modifications had no substantial effect on the flux, as shown in Figure 5 . Work on rescaled crevices by Lee et al. 42 was leveraged to ensure that effects due to gravity were countered by capillary forces and did not lead to momentum transfer within the pit. These calculations applied the Young-Laplace equation for hydrostatic equilibrium, considering the solution within the pit as a cylinder, as shown in Equation 2 : where γ is the average surface tension (= 78 dyne/cm) and ρ is the average density (= 1.2 g/cm 3 ) of the pit solution (considered the arithmetic mean of the solution of cationic chlorides at 100% saturation and 0.6 M NaCl, as mentioned previously), calculated using OLI Analyzer Studio 9.3. d and ϕ are the pit depth and diameter respectively, and θ is the contact angle between the solution and the pit wall. These calculations are plotted in Figure 8 for θ = 45°; using the entire range of the cosine function would yield similar results for the capillary force, i . e . three orders of magnitude greater than the weight of the solution.

from Soup: 23 The results shown in Figure 5 were consistent with the interpretation provided in published hydrodynamic studies on pitting 41 , 43 that external fluid flow has little effect on narrow cavities as opposed to shallow ones. The possibility of mass transport effects due to corrosion product precipitation (which may be likely in the neutral chloride solution when the cations encounter a higher pH at the pit mouth) can be rejected for the pit diameters studied based on the results shown in Figure 6 . These results demonstrated that performing the same experiment in media in which the bulk pH would be too low for such corrosion products to precipitate does not lead to a considerable change in flux. On the basis of these results, mass transport effects observed in the system can therefore be examined solely on the basis of a dependence on pit depth.

from Soup: 24 The deviation from linearity at shallow pit depths displayed by the numerically simulated flux results can be attributed to the effect of the external hemispherical boundary layer on the total diffusion length. 31 The deviation from the analytical Fickian expectation therefore occurs because the pit depth alone does not approximate the total diffusion length for shallow pits. The hemispherical boundary layer influences the mass transport because the cation concentration outside the pit does not immediately vanish at the pit mouth. Instead, this change in concentration occurs across a finite length; for shallow pits, this additional length is comparable to and sometimes much larger than the pit depth, as shown in Figure 9.

from Soup: 25 The consequence of this effect is that the mass transport follows a behavior expressed in terms of a modified version of Equation 1 : where δ represents the effect of the boundary layer on the overall diffusion length. The value of δ can be calculated using Equation 3 from the numerically simulated data. As Figure 9a indicates, δ is dependent only on the pit diameter and does not change as the pit depth increases. When normalized in terms of the pit diameter ϕ, δ assumed relatively constant values equal to approximately 40% of the pit diameter across the range of pit depths studied ( Figure 9b ). Finally in Figure 9c , when visualized as a fraction of the pit depth, it is abundantly clear that for the larger pit diameter, the effect of the boundary layer is massive for shallow pits. At these depths, δ contributes disproportionately to the overall diffusion length because it is nearly three orders of magnitude greater than the pit depth. Conversely, as pits grow deeper, the effect of δ on the overall diffusion length diminishes greatly, as is made distinctly apparent in the figure. In fact, at pit depths where the numerically simulated flux is seen to converge with the analytical calculations, δ is less than 2% of the pit depth. Therefore, for deep pits, the relative influence of δ vanishes and utilizing the pit depth alone serves as a good approximation for the overall diffusion length.

from Soup: 26 The effect of δ on the observed mass transport of the system can also be examined in terms of the change in concentration from the pit base to the pit mouth. Figure 10 displays the concentration change across the model domain using a set of concentration profiles (similar to Figure 3b ). As is evident upon comparing Figures 10a and 10b , the concentration profile of the pit of smaller diameter is closer to the theoretical basis of ΔC = ( C sat – 0) = 5.02 M than that of the pit of larger diameter. This result implies that the concentration gradient for the smaller diameter is steeper than that of the larger diameter because both these pits are of the same depth. In order to interpret these data in terms of a generalized geometry, the cation concentration at the pit mouth as estimated by the simulations is plotted as a fraction of the concentration at the pit base ( C sat = 5.02 M) against pit depth normalized by the pit diameter (d/ϕ) in Figure 11 . As can be seen in this plot, the data obtained based on different pit diameters collapses on to a single curve, indicating that the concentration of the pit mouth approaches zero only when pit depths close to 10 times the pit diameter are attained.

from Soup: 28 This value is the true measure of the anodic stability parameter because it reflects a zero cation concentration gradient at the pit mouth, which is the theoretical basis of the Galvele formulation. 3 The resulting expression is similar in form to Equation 1 and is expressed below, and is also noted similarly in the literature: 25 , 27 , 28 , 34 As the bulk [Cl − ] increases, C pitmouth increases, and the corresponding change in measured ( i ⋅ x ) saltfilm is mapped by the slope of the linear fit in Figure 12a .

from Soup: 29 From Figure 12b , the slopes of the linear fits for the experimental data obtained at shallow pits are lower than those for the deep pits. Furthermore, the scatter (indicated by the R 2 value) is lower for deep pits than for shallow pits. The ( i ⋅ x ) saltfilm value of 0.9031 obtained for deep pits is in good agreement with the value of ( i ⋅ x ) saltfilm isolated from the effects of bulk [Cl − ] (y-intercept in Figure 12a ). Figure 13 shows the apparent cation concentration at the pit mouth as a fraction of C sat mapped against the bulk [Cl − ], calculated from the experimental ( i ⋅ x ) saltfilm versus bulk [Cl − ] data, 27 assuming a constant value of D . It is evident that as the bulk [Cl − ] increases, the cation concentration of the pit mouth increases. This result therefore implies that as the bulk [Cl − ] rises, the assumption that the cation concentration at the pit mouth is zero breaks down, i.e., Δ C is no longer equal to C sat . This result may be reflective of the fact that viscosity effects on physicochemical parameters play an increasingly important role in determining mass transport as the bulk chemistry becomes more concentrated in chloride, as reported in the literature. 19 , 29 , 36 , 44 Such effects on solution properties may have an impact on both D as well as C sat , the latter being influenced by the common ion effect from the bulk electrolyte as has been discussed in other studies. 29 , 36 , 44 In toto , the results shown in Figures 9 through 13 demonstrate that it is imperative to account for the effects of both pit depth as well as bulk electrolyte chemistry during measurement and analysis of artificial pit studies to obtain accurate estimates of pit stability parameters.

from Soup: 30 The influence of pit depth and bulk electrolyte concentration also impacts the value of C sat considered when calculating the analytically determined Fickian 1-D flux. This point is made particularly evident when the experimental data from Gaudet et al. 14 is considered (reproduced in Figure 14 ). At pit depths of ≈400 μm, the experimental values (data points) appear to converge to the analytical expectation (dashed line) calculated using the saturation concentration of FeCl 2 in 1 M HCl (4.2 M). 45 However, the results from this study show that the experimental data converge with the analytical calculations with low scatter only when the depth is greater than about 8 times the diameter ( Figure 7 ). Therefore, for a pit diameter of 1 mm, deviation between experiment and theory would be expected to disappear only beyond a depth of 8 mm, in contrast to 400 μm as observed. When 5.02 M, the value obtained from in situ X-ray measurement of the stoichiometrically dissolved 18–8 stainless steel in chloride solution, 35 is used for C sat instead, it is observed that the experimental data now indeed deviate from the analytical prediction (solid line) at ≈400 μm. It must also be noted that the experimental data of Gaudet et al., 14 although convergent at ≈400 μm to the analytical expectation assuming a surface concentration of 4.2 M FeCl 2 , begin to deviate from that line towards the line describing a surface concentration of 5.02 M as deeper pits are approached, as can be observed in Figure 14.

from Soup: 31 The observed agreement of the experimental data with the analytically determined calculations based on a C sat of 4.2 M can be rationalized with analysis based on the data from Figures 12 and 13 . The experimental data of Gaudet et al. were reportedly obtained in a solution with a concentration of approximately 1 M [Cl − ]. Substituting this value for [Cl − ] in Equation 4 , a value of 0.79 A/m for ( i ⋅ x ) saltfilm is obtained, which in turn results in a value of 4.52 M for C sat , which is in good agreement with the value of 4.2 M used by Gaudet et al., 14 with a relative error of only around 7.6%. This deviation was within the error of the linear regression for ( i ⋅ x ) saltfilm in Figure 12a . These results reinforce the necessity of data collection from deep pits. The lack of data from sufficiently deep pits (> d / ϕ ≈ 8) indicates that the experimental values in the Gaudet et al. 14 obtained are not isolated from the effects of bulk [Cl − ]. The depressed value of ( i ⋅ x ) saltfilm that is obtained as a result yields a C sat estimate which is lower than the actual value for 18–8 stainless steel, but fortuitously agrees with the value for FeCl 2 in 1 M HCl. Consequently, the perceived agreement of the Gaudet et al. 14 experimental data with the analytical predictions at depths shallower than expected from this study emerges because a lower value of C sat based on FeCl 2 solubility rather than stoichiometric dissolution of the stainless steel was used.

from Soup: 32 The results in this study can also be used to examine the impact of pit depth on the critical surface concentration associated with repassivation. Several studies have shown that a salt film is not critical for stable pit growth 13 , 29 , 46 and that pit stability ought to be examined in the context of repassivation. 10 , 28 , 30 This latter idea implies that the minimum critical conditions for stable pit growth also characterize pit repassivation. Figure 15a shows that even when the surface concentration at the pit base is diluted to lower fractions of the concentration at saturation, the numerically simulated flux continues to converge towards the analytically determined flux at pit depths which are approximately eight to ten times the pit diameter. Suzuki and Kitamura 47 reported that for 316L in chloride solution, activated pits that were about ten times as deep as their diameter registered a critical potential for repassivation similar to activated crevices. In their study, the dissolution current density was monitored versus time at progressively lower applied potentials. The critical potential in their study was defined as the lowest potential at which this dissolution could not be sustained upon prolonged holding (≈ 20 h). The results of the present study provide quantitative support to the notion that it is only upon attaining depths about ten times the diameter that sufficient mass transport restriction results for 1-D pits to sustain the steady-state concentration necessary to corrode stably with a film-free surface. For shallower 1-D pits, the diffusion out of the pit would overwhelm the rate of metal dissolution, leading to repassivation.

from Soup: 33 The view that restricted mass transport impedes repassivation has been substantiated by Sridhar and Cragnolino, 32 as well as Srinivasan et al., 30 who have shown that crevice formation in large-area samples can lead to the measurement of more active repassivation potential values even when the charge density passed is low. Finally, studies using artificial pits 27 , 28 , 30 have shown that the depth at which the measured repassivation potential approaches a plateau is approximately eight to ten times the pit diameter, as can be seen in the data reproduced in Figure 15b . These latter results lend credence to the proposition that at this pit depth, a critical steady state concentration (lower than 100% saturation) 30 , 32 , 34 is attained at the pit base, with equal rates of both metal dissolution and diffusion out of the pit, thus marking the transition between pit stability and repassivation.

from Soup: 34 This study employed artificial pit experiments as well as finite element modeling to elucidate the effects of pit depth on the flux emanating from 1-D pits, providing commentary on proper collection, analysis, and interpretation of pit stability data from artificial experiments. For shallow pits, the hemispherical boundary layer at the pit mouth significantly affected the flux characteristics. It was only once pits had attained depths of around eight times the diameter that the overall diffusion length could be approximated well by the pit depth alone. The examination of results from artificial pit experiments reinforced the importance of obtaining data from deep pits so that pit stability parameters extracted not only reflected true 1-D mass transport based on the pit depth, but also were not affected by the bulk electrolyte. Artificial pit experiments performed in several configurations ruled out the influence of convective transport and the precipitation of corrosion products on the mass transport in pits of small diameter. The trends observed in published experimental data were also explained by the inferences of bulk electrolyte effects obtained from this work. Finally, the results of this investigation were also used to rationalize the observed dependence of repassivation potential on pit depth, thereby providing a quantitative connection between pit stability and repassivation studies.
