Simple and practical method of material preparation plays an important role in nanotechnology. Especially the ordered Micro/nano-tructures arrays are building blocks of nanometer circuits, recently becomes a hot topic.3–6 Many methods for preparing micro/nano-structures, such as using a template or similar one, combined with electrodeposition technique, have been reported previously.7–11 Variation of growth conditions will lead to the change of valence state of material surface and interface, further result in the change of the materials resistance remarkably. The high quality sensors could be fabricated according to this principle. Palladium is a good adsorbent to hydrogen, and it can adsorb about 900 times H2 of it's own volume.12 Many peopoles have researched Pd nanowires/film gas sensor. But onefold Pd is limited to adsorb,,and easy to bubble in surroundings of H2 with high concentration, which can cause the sensor to invalid. If Pd material is combined with Ni, Hydrogenated Palladium could be stabilized, furthermore will prevent phase transition of Hydrogenated Palladium from α to β.13 It has been reported that Pd-Ni Alloy with Ni of 8%∼15% (quality fraction) has better reversibility, fast response in H2 environment at room temperature, and also can prevent poisoning of Hydrogen Sulfide.14 Eunsongyi Lee et al. have researched Pd–Ni alloy thin films gas sensor.15 They investigated the hydrogen (H2) sensing properties of palladium (Pd)–nickel (Ni) alloy films with varying Ni content and discussed them in light of structural deformations. Their results was the Pd–Ni alloys operated reversibly upon H2 absorption and desorption and their sensitivities decreased linearly with Ni content added to Pd. The response time of the Pd–Ni alloys was much shorter than that of pure Pd. Unlike pure Pd, the Pd–Ni alloys showed an almost linear relationship between the sensitivity and H2 concentration without hysteretic behaviors, enabling the detection of low concentration of H2 down to 0.01%. Arrays of Palladium-Nickel Alloy Micro/nano-tructures materials with Ni of 8%∼15% can be used to fabricate H2 sensors. Massood Z have proposed the sensing mechanism.8 Upon exposure to H2, Pd absorbs H2 resulting in the expansion of Pd grains. This causes compression along the axis of the grains of Pd. After removal of H2, when the sample is subsequently placed in ambient air, contraction of each of the grains occurs resulting in tensile stress, causing the nanowires to break and hence form nanoscopic gaps. This change causes high change of sensor material conductance. The Pd/Ni sensor will have characteristics such as high efficiency, stable, fast response, high selectivity and sensitivity, etc. Simple and practical means of preparing materials are very important to basic research and applications.

Finally, they were treated with oxygen for 3 min at 300 W (Templa System 100-E plasma system) and rinsed again with deionized water. These treatments caused the silicon surface to become fully hydrophilic. A surface structure with a -CH3 termination was obtained by immersing a silicon substrate into a 1 mM octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) (APTMS, Aldrich) solution of 1-phenyloctane(Aldrich) for 15 min. This procedure was followed by ultrasonic cleaning and rinsing in chloroform to remove the polymeric residuals. The experimental setup for the electrodeposition is shown schematically in Figure 1.

Figure 2b indicates that the quasi one-dimensional deposit has a branch-like structure. Although there are many single branch bifurcation, but overall, it seems that all branches form an array, and each branch is independent. A clear morphology is shown in Figure 2c with a magnification of 40,000, and it can be seen that the main branch of the quasi one-dimensional branch is about 300 nm in diameter. There are also lots of dense grains on the branch surface. In this sample preparation process, varying electric voltage was used as drive force. Because deposit grew too slowly or fast at the constant voltage, when the growth went on in some minutes, we adjusted the voltage to keeping growth at an appropriate speed.

Figure 3 shows the overall morphology of sample 2 in the growth condition with a voltage change from a half-sine voltage (Figure 4 ) to 2.8 V constant voltage. Two different patterns are included, the quasi one-dimensional “linear array” and quasi two-dimensional film. The line array was prepared using the semi-sinusoidal voltage. The overall film marked with a gray shadow box is deposited under constant voltage. The arrow indicates the boundary region. Figure 5a shows the morphology of sample 2 used semi-sinusoidal voltage (Figure 4 ) in the growth. This corresponds to the quasi one-dimensional “line array” part in Figure 3 . This part of the structure has fork-like branching morphology. The arrow marked the boundary where the change of semi-sinusoidal bias was applied. In the right part of this figure, the deposition bias voltage is 0.7 V. There is little bifurcation, and the wire is sparse. In the left part of the figure, the deposition bias voltage is 0.8 V. It can be observed from the Figure 5a , when the bias voltage increases, the line becomes denser and more bifurcations as shown in the left region. The growth of such morphology is slow. Figure 5b shows the morphology of the sample 2 used 2.8 V constant voltage as drive force. It corresponds to the quasi two-dimensional “compact membrane” part in Figure 3 . The growth process of the film is very slow. The film shows obvious periodic structure, and it may be generated by self-oscillation of the over potential, which will be expatiated later.

from Soup: 6 Composition analysis of Pd-Ni alloy material by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX). The composition of Pd-Ni alloy material was studied by the EDX. Figure 6 is the EDX spectrum of sample 1. It was produced by origin6.0 soft in experiment data, which can be seen more clearly. It detected Pd, Ni, Si, O, and C, wich indicates the deposits contained palladium and nickel elements. Si is from the substrate. O may be due to oxidation of the sample. C may come from the sample surface contamination. The EDX spectrum indicates that the Ni and Pd atomic ratio is 1.7:1. In the alloy, the mass fraction of Ni (wt%) is approximately 36%.

from test: 7 Using electrolyte solution with a different ratio, sample 2 was prepared. Figure 3 shows the overall morphology of sample 2 in the growth condition with a voltage change from a half-sine voltage (Figure 4) to 2.8 V constant voltage. Two different patterns are included, the quasi one-dimensional “linear array” and quasi two-dimensional film. The line array was prepared using the semi-sinusoidal voltage. The overall film marked with a gray shadow box is deposited under constant voltage. The arrow indicates the boundary region.
from Soup: 7 Influence about electrolyte concentration and growth voltage to deposits. Under the different deposition conditions, the deposits have different characters such as more or less of bifurcation, “tree branch” or quasi wire. During the deposition process, the morphology of the growing wire varies with the change of applied voltage, as shown in Figure 7 , which was full morphology of samples 1. Lines A, B and C shows three fronts borderline corresponding to the moments when voltage was set to 2.4 V, 1.6 V, and 1.8 V, respectively. It can be observed that more forks of “tree branch” and denser branches appeared in the areas at higher depositing voltage (2.4 V, 1.8 V). On the contrary, in the areas using lower depositing voltage (1.6 V), the branches appear to be sparse, less forks of “tree branch” was less, as shown in the region between line B and line C. This phenomenon also occurred in sample 2 shown in Figure 5a . When the bias voltage of half-sine was 0.7 V, the deposit had fewer forks, and the wire arranged sparsely. While the bias voltage was 0.8 V, the deposit had more forks, and the wire distributed densely. So some conclusions may be obtained from preparing experiment and experiment results. When an electrolyte solution with a fixed concentration is used, and applied electric voltage reaches the critical value that can trigger deposition, smaller depositing electric voltage will lead to deposits with less bifurcation and highly ordered patterns. Besides pH value of electrolyte solution was better to be near 2.0, or much gas would arose in experiment process, which can cause experiment fail.

The growth process of the film is very slow. The film shows obvious periodic structure, and it may be generated by self-oscillation of the over potential, which will be expatiated later.
from Soup: 9 In elecrodeposition experiment, the interface was formed due to the contact of electrodes and electrolyte. At the interface, ion exchange happens between electrodes and electrolyte. After stabilization of the exchange, Galvani potential difference exists on cathode to anode, namely electrode potential. When the depositing voltage was applied between the two electrodes in preparation cell, the electric circuity was built up and the current ran in the electrolyte solution. Pd at the anode lost electron and became Pd 2+ , and then entered into the electrolyte. The electrons flowed to the cathode along the interior circuity of the outside power source. The Pd 2+ and Ni 2+ ions were transported to the cathode. The modes of transportation in the electrolyte solution includes electro-transfer, convection and diffusion. In our experiment, the concentration of the solution of PdCl 2 and NiCl 2 was low, so the electro-transfer was the main transporting way. Under the electric field driving, The Pd 2+ and Ni 2+ ions were transferred to the interface of cathode. The higher the voltage was applied, the faster the transfer was. and the Pd 2+ and Ni 2+ transferred on interface were more and more. With the transportation, the concentration of Pd 2+ and Ni 2+ in interface was growing higher. According to Nernst equation Δφ=E0+RTZFln1αM2+ (Here α denotes concentration of Ni 2+ or Pd 2+ ), the potential of the cathode would become negative. The over potential would emerge. Based on electron double layer theory, there were electrons on electrode surface. With the presence of over potential, the deoxidize reaction started. The Ni 2+ and Pd 2+ ions close to electrode surface were deoxidized to Pd and Ni atoms. These atoms moved to the place by diffusion, where energy is the lowest, such as defects and steps. Many atoms assembled to form the crystal nucleus. The next coming atoms deposited onto the existed nucleus by diffusion, and the deposit grew up. When the applied voltage was higher, the speed of transportation was faster, so that more Ni 2+ or Pd 2+ ions were transferred to the interface area, and the deoxidization reaction and deposition speed became faster.

It was produced by origin6.0 soft in experiment data, which can be seen more clearly. It detected Pd, Ni, Si, O, and C, wich indicates the deposits contained palladium and nickel elements.

In the alloy, the mass fraction of Ni (wt%) is approximately 36%.
from Soup: 11 While the voltage was much higher, besieds the growth direction along electric field, other growth direction which was nonparallel to the electric field occurred due to diffusion. The deposit would fork on the wires just like tree branches as showed in Figure 2 .
 ###### 
from test: 12 Influence about electrolyte concentration and growth voltage to deposits.
from Soup: 12 If the voltage was even higher, so that the concentration of Pd 2+ and Ni 2+ ions in the interface was high enough, landscape orientation diffusion was very active, and the deposit would be the membrane, as showed in Figure 5b . When the deoxidization of Ni 2+ and Pd 2+ was processing at the cathode, the oxidation of Pd also happened at the anode simultaneously, which produced Pd 2+ ions. The ions were supplied into solution. The speed of deoxidization and deposition were not equal to oxidation speed. With the deposition, the Ni 2+ and Pd 2+ ions distributed by electro-transfer and diffuseness were not enough to compensate the consumed ions, which will cause the over potential gradually increase, and finally ions disappeared. The reaction and deposition collapsed. During the stage of the cease of deposition, the oxidation of Pd at the anode and the electro-transfer still processed. When the concentration of the Ni 2+ and Pd 2+ at the interface reached a certain degree, the over potential again emerged, deposition restored. In this way, periodic structure was made. This was so-called self-oscillation of the over potential, which resulted in the periodic shape of the “compact membrane”. The borderline of the membrane was seen in the SEM image of Figure 5b , corresponding to the moment when the deposition ceased.
