This paper deals with the determination and the evolution of the different contributions to the dielectric constant (electronic, ionic and dipolar). These contributions are evaluated using the temperature dependence of the permittivity and refractive index measurements. Physicochemical and electrical characterizations are performed in order to enlighten the impact of porosity increase and post-treatment on the different contributions to the dielectric constant. Our study shows that a continuous decrease of the ionic fraction is observed when the porosity increases, which is mainly linked to the Si-O-Si concentration evolution.

from test: 1 PECVD films were deposited on RF capacitive coupled parallel plate reactor from Applied Material (using a plasma excitation frequency at 13.56 MHz). Porous SiOCH were performed by co-depositing a matrix precursor and a sacrificial organic porogen, followed by a post-treatment to remove the organic porogen phase and create porosity. DiEthoxyMethylSilane (DEMS) was used as silicon-based precursor for the matrix and different organic molecules were tested as porogen precursor: a-terpinene (ATRP) or norbornadiene (NBD). The deposition conditions are described in previous papers.4,11,12 Two different treatments were performed in order to remove the porogen species and create porosity: a thermal annealing (thermal treatment) and a UV assisted thermal treatment (UV curing). The thermal treatment was achieved using a hotplate system at a temperature of 450°C under N2 atmosphere. UV curing was performed on a hotplate at 400°C placed under a broadband ultra-violet lamp exposition and He atmosphere. Details on the optimization of the curing treatment are available in.11,13
from Soup: 1 The field of nanoporous dielectrics is gradually reaching its maturity stage and most of industrial manufacturers are integrating ultra low-κ (ULK) as interlayer dielectric in their most advanced technologies. However, despite the optimistic previsions from the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors on the introduction of ULK in future node, 1 we encounter a slight slowdown in the race toward lower dielectric constant materials (κ lower than 2.2). ULK deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) are usually performed by using the “porogen approach” where a sacrificial porogen is co-deposited with an organosilicate precursor. 2 , 3 Then, porosity is created by removing the organic porogen phase during an appropriate thermal treatment. The main strategy used to continue the race toward low κ consists to increase the porosity ratio in the film by increasing the porogen content during the film deposition. However, it has been shown that this approach is limited 3 , 4 and a recent review pointed out that the porogen approach does not easily allow decreasing the κ value below 2. 5 A way to overcome this limitation requires a better understanding of the origin of the dielectric constant in these materials. However, discussions on this subject are generally limited to the electronic polarization 6 and only few studies deal with the determination of the different contributions to the dielectric constant of SiOCH thin films (The dielectric constant of an insulating material presents usually three types of contributions: electronic, ionic and dipolar). Some papers were published few years ago on dense SiOCH deposited by PECVD pointing out the importance of the carbon content in the material. 7 , 8 More recently, Kim et al. have studied the impact of the physico-chemistry on the different contributions to the dielectric constant in case of silicate-silsesquioxane hybrid thin films deposited by spin-coating. 9 In porous SiOCH, Smith et al. have investigated the impact of the UV curing on the different contributions to the dielectric constant for κ higher than 2.5. 10

The electronic contribution arises from the polarization generated by the distortion of the electron clouds from the nucleus. The ionic polarization corresponds to motions of the nuclei with respect to each other, i.e. to molecular vibrations. The dipolar contribution corresponds to polar molecules whose dipoles tries to align with the applied electric field. The Clausius-Mossoti equation is sometime used in the literature (it takes into account the dipole-dipole interaction) but, as shown in previous works, this model does not lead to a better fit in case of low density SiOCH material in comparison to the model for diluted media.8

from test: 13 In a high frequency electric field (from visible to UV), the dipole and ionic contributions are low because of the inertia of ions and molecules. The electrons only can respond to the “fast” changes of the field. Therefore, relative permittivity is almost entirely due to electronic polarization, and in the visible range: where n is the refractive index and k is the absorption coefficient. Since the extinction coefficient of SiOCH materials is very low (close or lower than few 10−3, thus negligible7,18,19), equation 5 can be simply expressed as 1 + εe = n2. Figure 2 shows the variation of the dielectric constant versus the square of the refractive index recorded at 632.8 nm. As expected, the general trend shows that the dielectric constant decreases when the refractive index decreases. However, the results are dispersed and no model allows fitting the experimental results. The best experimental point is far above the theoretical limit κ = n2. That implies the presence of ionic and dipolar contributions to the dielectric constant. Figure 2 shows also that samples from the same batch (same precursor chemistry and same curing) can present similar refractive index but significantly different dielectric constants. A quantification of the different contributions to the dielectric constant will help to understand this result.

This line corresponds to the minimum ionic and dipolar contributions in our porous SiOCH samples. It is worth noticing that samples above this line present an ionic or/and dipolar contributions higher to the “optimal” samples (optimal meaning here with the lowest dipolar and ionic contributions).

from test: 15 To access to the static relative permittivity and to reflect the total polarization (electronic, ionic and dipolar), experiments are usually carried out at low frequencies (typically 100 kHz or 1 MHz). Figure 3 shows the variations of the dielectric constant as function of the frequency for SiO2 and SiOCH (κ = 2.35, UV cured). Both materials present similar evolution. At room temperature, the dielectric constant slightly decreases with frequency which is a behavior already observed for dielectrics.20 But no abrupt drop of the dielectric constant (relaxation process) is seen. In order to detect relaxations which are not observable at room temperature, experiments were carried out between 25 and 200°C. Figure 4 shows the variations of the dielectric constant (κ) and the dissipation factor (tan δ) as function of the frequency in the range 10−1–105 Hz. The loss (proportional to tan δ) is lower than 10−2 in agreement with the literature21 and slightly decreases with temperature. A small tail appears at low frequency and at high temperature in Figure 4b. Gonon et al. attributed this tail in SiOCH to long chain relaxation or to residual free ions whose hopping movement under alternating fields leads to relaxations at very low frequencies.8 However, the smallness of this effect does not allow us to conclude on this phenomenon. At the same time, no relaxation is detected in the dielectric constant, the κ decrease with frequency being attenuated at high temperature.
from Soup: 15 By assuming that ionic and dipolar components are proportional to 1- p ( p being the porosity and A the coefficient of proportionality), we can estimate a lower permittivity limit for porous SiOCH films: plotted in black in Fig. 2 (with ε ion + ε dip = A (1 − p ), 1- p being estimated using the Lorentz-Lorenz model for simplicity).

It is worth noticing that samples above this line present an ionic or/and dipolar contributions higher to the “optimal” samples (optimal meaning here with the lowest dipolar and ionic contributions).
 ###### 
from test: 16 Figure 4a also shows that the dielectric constant decreases significantly when the temperature increases from 25°C to 200°C. On one hand, this result which is reversible cannot be explained by a change of film thickness, the thermal coefficient for porous SiOCH being only of the order of few tenth of ppm/K.22 On the other hand, the dipolar polarization is temperature dependent while electronic and ionic polarizations are weakly thermally influenced.23 Then, variations of the dielectric constant as function of the temperature indicate that dipole moments exist in the film. As already shown by Gonon et al., the simple Debye model gives a reasonable representation of the temperature dependence of dipolar contribution in SiOCH thin films:8 where Ndip is the dipoles density, μ the dipolar moment, kB the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature. Figure 5 shows the dielectric constant plotted as a function of 1/T. The model assumes that dipole density is low enough to neglect the Lorentz field created by surrounding dipoles. In our case, the Ndipμ2 value obtained from Figure 5 using the Debye model (≈10−34 C2.m−1 for SiO2 and 2.2 10−32 C2.m−1 for SiOCH with κ = 2.35) are not significantly different from those obtained using the Clausiuss-Mossoti equation which take into account the dipole – dipole interaction. Furthermore, the energy of dipole-dipole interaction is close to 1 meV ( 8) which is far below the thermal energy (25 meV at 300K) and, according to Fröhlich's criterion,23 validates the hypothesis of diluted media. From Fig. 5, the dipolar contribution can be easily obtained, the intercept of the line being equal to 1 + εe + εion, then εdip = κ − 1 − εe − εion.

from test: 17 Table I summarizes the results obtained for SiOCH films deposited at 260°C using DEMS and NBD for a same porogen loading after UV curing or after a thermal treatment. In all cases the electronic contribution remains predominant. The dielectric constant obtained after a thermal treatment is lower than that obtained after UV curing (2.25 vs. 2.45). This result is mainly attributed to a higher shrinkage during the UV curing (30%) while the film thermally cured shrinks by less than 11%.

 ###### 
from test: 18 The main consequence is that the porosity of the thermally cured film is higher than that of the film cured with UV (35% vs 24%). This effect allows explaining the lower electronic and ionic contribution (−17%) in the case of the thermal curing. The ionic contribution is mainly related to the presence of Si-O-Si bonds characterized by a strong band between 1040 – 1055 cm−1 with its shoulder at about 1142 cm−1 in Figure 6 and possibly to Si-OH groups (but these hydroxyl groups are scarce in our films which are deposited above 250°C 12). This experiment also shows that the dipolar contribution is higher after a thermal treatment. This result can be attributed to a slight difference in the material composition. In the case of thermally cured samples, Gourhant el al. have shown the presence of Si-O-CxHy groups (for instance ethyl groups coming from the organosilicate precursor) which can present a dipolar contribution.12 Unfortunately, the Si-O-C vibration usually occurs between 1100 and 1140 cm−1 in the FTIR spectrum and is overlapped by the Si-O-Si band. PECVD films cured with a thermal treatment can present a higher content of porogen residues (graphitic like structure observable close to 3030 cm−1 on the FTIR spectrum on Figure 6) which induce a dipolar contribution.11 The presence of hydroxyl groups (Si-OH) can also be at the origin of a dipolar contribution.8 Finally, Kim and co-workers have attributed their strong dipolar component in SiOCH films to Si-CHx groups7 which is also in agreement with the lower Si-CH3 contribution detected by FTIR (at 1275 cm−1) on the UV cured sample in comparison to the film after thermal treatment (see Figure 6).

More recently, Smith et al. have extended this investigation to porous SiOCH films deposited using DEMS and a porogen, then cured with a UV assisted thermal treatment.10 They also showed the presence of an ionic contribution which increases when the UV curing time increases while the dipolar contribution remains close to 0.17.

from test: 20 To go further, we have studied the impact of the porosity on the different contributions to the dielectric constant. Figure 7 shows the variations of these contributions as function of the porogen loading (porogen (NBD) to matrix precursor (DEMS) ratio in the plasma gas feed) in the case of UV curing. As already described previously, the dielectric constant presents a U shape: κ starts to decrease when more porogens is included in the deposited material. Above a porogen loading threshold, the dielectric constant increases. This is mainly due to both a high film shrinkage occurring during the post-treatment (the matrix collapses, see Figure 8a) and the presence of porogen residues. The increase of porogen loading enables the porosity enhancement only until a loading limit.3,4 A first observation of the evolution of the different contributions to the dielectric constant shows that the electronic part is always the major contribution in all cases (except the vacuum contribution). The second observation is that ionic and dipolar contributions exist in all cases.

 ###### 
from test: 21 Figure 7 shows that all these contributions do not evolve monotonically with the porogen loading. 3 distinct zones can be emphasized. In the phase 1, ɛe, ɛion and ɛdip decrease when the porogen loading increases. This behavior is due to an increase of porosity (see Figure 8a) which induces a decrease of the bonds density (directly proportional to each contribution to the permittivity20). There is no major change in the skeleton chemistry. It is worth noticing that, in this phase, the slopes deduced from a linear fit of the dipolar and of the ionic contributions are similar. This observation allows confirming the hypothesis used in equation 6 (εion + εdip = A(1 − p)).
from Soup: 21 To go further, we have studied the impact of the porosity on the different contributions to the dielectric constant. Figure 7 shows the variations of these contributions as function of the porogen loading (porogen (NBD) to matrix precursor (DEMS) ratio in the plasma gas feed) in the case of UV curing. As already described previously, the dielectric constant presents a U shape: κ starts to decrease when more porogens is included in the deposited material. Above a porogen loading threshold, the dielectric constant increases. This is mainly due to both a high film shrinkage occurring during the post-treatment (the matrix collapses, see Figure 8a ) and the presence of porogen residues. The increase of porogen loading enables the porosity enhancement only until a loading limit. 3 , 4 A first observation of the evolution of the different contributions to the dielectric constant shows that the electronic part is always the major contribution in all cases (except the vacuum contribution). The second observation is that ionic and dipolar contributions exist in all cases.
 ###### 
from test: 22 During the phase 2 and 3, a change of behavior is observed. ɛe and ɛdip increase when the porogen loading increases while the ionic contribution continue to decrease.
from Soup: 22 Figure 7 shows that all these contributions do not evolve monotonically with the porogen loading. 3 distinct zones can be emphasized. In the phase 1, ɛ e , ɛ ion and ɛ dip decrease when the porogen loading increases. This behavior is due to an increase of porosity (see Figure 8a ) which induces a decrease of the bonds density (directly proportional to each contribution to the permittivity 20 ). There is no major change in the skeleton chemistry. It is worth noticing that, in this phase, the slopes deduced from a linear fit of the dipolar and of the ionic contributions are similar. This observation allows confirming the hypothesis used in equation 6 (ε ion + ε dip = A (1 − p )).
 ###### 
from test: 23 During the phase 2, the dielectric constant decreases down to a minimum value (2.3 in this example) in agreement with the increase of porosity. The increase of the electronic and dipolar contribution can be attributed to a slight change in the chemistry of the material. The presence of organics species (porogen residues) can potentially explain this behavior. For instance, Postava et al. have shown that organic low κ present high electronic contribution.24 Moreover, as discussed previously, the presence of organic compounds due to porogen residues (such as C=C-H) have also a dipolar contribution.

 ###### 
from test: 24 In the last portion (phase 3), the increase of the dielectric constant is mainly due to the matrix collapse during the porogen removal (leading to an increase of bonds density). However, the ionic contribution continues to decrease. This behavior can be attributed to the decrease of the Si-O-Si concentration in the film as shown in Figure 8b. During phase 2, the decrease of the Si-O-Si concentration is due to the porosity increase and during phase 3, the film becomes more organic. This leads to a change in the skeleton structure (see for instance the Si-O-Si change on Figure 9) and to the presence of porogen residues (the film with a porogen loading of 70% present a clear evidence of graphitic like structure close to 3025 cm−1 in the C-Hx band). The increase of the organic nature of the film during the phase 3 contributes also to the increase of the electronic and dipolar contribution as observed in the phase 2. All these observations allow us illustrating that a compromise between Si-O-Si concentration and carbon bonding in the film is required to optimize the skeleton dielectric constant: the skeleton should be enough organic to have a low ionic polarization mainly linked to the Si-O-Si concentration but this carbon content should be limited in order to limit the electronic part of the permittivity. For example, a film (κ = 2.3) deposited from DEMS and NBD and cured using UV has 13% of Si, 23% of O, 21% of C and 43% of H (SiO1.8C1.6H3.3 determined by RBS, NRA and ERDA experiments). A film (κ = 2.1) deposited from DEMS and NBD and cured using a thermal treatment has 11% of Si, 19% of O, 25% of C and 45% of H (SiO1.7C2.3H4.1 determined by RBS, NRA and ERDA experiments) which is far from the SiO3/2CH3 where 1 methyl is connected to each silicon.

from test: 25 Dipolar species can be minimized by removing appropriately all the porogen residues mainly constituted of graphitic-like compounds. The presence of C=C bonds should be avoided and Si-CH3 bonds are preferable in comparison to Si-O-C. Then, appropriate precursor/deposition/curing conditions should be favored to avoid the presence of Si-O-CxHy bonds. To this prospect, even if UV curing allows limiting the presence of this Si-O-C bonds when DEMS is used as matrix precursor, other organosilicate precursors without ethyl bonds could be potentially more advantageous. Even if Si-O-Si bonds bring a strong ionic contribution, they remain necessary for the skeleton strength: A compromise should be found between low κ and high elastic properties.

from test: 26 Figure 10 presents the variations of the dielectric constant as function of the refractive index for different SiOCH films (porous or not) published in the literature. PECVD and spin-on dielectrics are represented. The dot blue line corresponds to the square of the refractive index which is the sum of the vacuum permittivity and the contribution of the electronic polarization (n2 = 1 + εe). This represents, from a theoretical point of view, the lower limit below which it is impossible to decrease the dielectric constant. The dot black curve is deduced from Figure 2 and displays that dipolar and ionic contributions are significant in SiOCH films. As shown previously, several materials can present dielectric constants significantly different even if these materials have similar refractive index. For instance, high differences are observed in the case of spin-coated methylsilsesquioxane with the same porosity rate because their crosslinking states (and the presence of more or less Si-OH) have a limited impact on the refractive index (electronic contribution) while these bonds presents ionic and dipolar characteristics.25 It is interesting to notice that most of the porous SiOCH films studied in the literature present dielectric constant above the black line which corresponds to the best films performed in this work (in term of optimization of the dielectric constant). The material close to this line corresponds to thin films containing very few Si-OH bonds (unfavorable species because very easily polarizable) and thus close to the ideal crosslinking state. They constitute also a good compromise between the organic part (through methyl bonded to silicon) and Si-O-Si bonds. Only few groups report materials with dielectric constant below this limit. These results are difficult to explain but the lack of unique methodology to measure the dielectric constant can be potentially the first responsible for this disparity. For instance, dielectric constant measurements are sometime performed at temperature higher than room temperature which leads to lower κ values. But according to Table I, it seems very unlikely to have SiOCH thin films without ionic and dipolar contributions to the dielectric constant (20% of the total dielectric constant being a minimum value for porosity lower than 50% if we refer to Table I).

Indeed, several works have shown that Si-CH2-Si bonds can be helpful to improve the mechanical properties of porous SiOCH films without compromising the dielectric constant reduction. From the permittivity point of view, they present also non negligible ionic and dipolar contributions.

from test: 28 In this study, we have evaluated the different contributions to the dielectric constant (electronic, ionic and dipolar) for several porous SiOCH deposited by PECVD. In all cases, it seems very unlikely to have SiOCH thin films without ionic and dipolar contributions. A comparison between our data and literature allow evidencing the existence of a lower limit for the dielectric constant of porous Ultra Low-κ based on SiOCH skeleton. Our study shows that a continuous decrease of the ionic fraction is observed when the porosity increases, which is mainly linked to the Si-O-Si concentration evolution. In the meantime, graphitic-like structures increase the dipolar contribution of the permittivity. The dipolar contribution is also related to the presence of Si-O-C bonds. Then, appropriate precursor/deposition/curing conditions should be used to avoid the presence of Si-O-CxHy bonds and porogen residues.

from test: 29 The field of nanoporous dielectrics is gradually reaching its maturity stage and most of industrial manufacturers are integrating ultra low-κ (ULK) as interlayer dielectric in their most advanced technologies. However, despite the optimistic previsions from the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors on the introduction of ULK in future node,1 we encounter a slight slowdown in the race toward lower dielectric constant materials (κ lower than 2.2). ULK deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) are usually performed by using the “porogen approach” where a sacrificial porogen is co-deposited with an organosilicate precursor.2,3 Then, porosity is created by removing the organic porogen phase during an appropriate thermal treatment. The main strategy used to continue the race toward low κ consists to increase the porosity ratio in the film by increasing the porogen content during the film deposition. However, it has been shown that this approach is limited3,4 and a recent review pointed out that the porogen approach does not easily allow decreasing the κ value below 2.5 A way to overcome this limitation requires a better understanding of the origin of the dielectric constant in these materials. However, discussions on this subject are generally limited to the electronic polarization6 and only few studies deal with the determination of the different contributions to the dielectric constant of SiOCH thin films (The dielectric constant of an insulating material presents usually three types of contributions: electronic, ionic and dipolar). Some papers were published few years ago on dense SiOCH deposited by PECVD pointing out the importance of the carbon content in the material.7,8 More recently, Kim et al. have studied the impact of the physico-chemistry on the different contributions to the dielectric constant in case of silicate-silsesquioxane hybrid thin films deposited by spin-coating.9 In porous SiOCH, Smith et al. have investigated the impact of the UV curing on the different contributions to the dielectric constant for κ higher than 2.5.10

from test: 30 In this work, we have investigated the different contributions to the dielectric constant of porous SiOCH thin films by combining capacitance measurements as function of the temperature and refractive index measurements. These contributions (electronic, ionic, dipolar) are linked to the porosity content and the chemical nature of the film.
