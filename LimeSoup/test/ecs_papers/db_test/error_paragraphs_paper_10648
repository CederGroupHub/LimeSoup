from test: 0 Li-air batteries with organic electrolyte at the anode and aqueous electrolyte at the cathode (dual electrolyte systems) are modeled using the mass transport and drift-diffusion equations of the electrolyte during the discharge of the cells. Two regimes of operation are analyzed: (1) when the concentration of the electrolyte is smaller than the concentration of saturation of Li+OH− in water, and (2) when the electrolyte concentration reaches saturation and the reaction product is deposited at the cathode. Numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the dependence of the specific capacity, energy and power densities on the geometrical and material parameters during the two regimes of operation. It is shown that the energy density and specific capacity can be improved by increasing the solubility and the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in the cathode, but they are not much affected by adding a uniformly distributed catalyst in the cathode. The power density can be increased by 10% by increasing the solubility factor, the oxygen diffusion coefficient, or the reaction rate. The limiting factors for the low power density of these batteries are the low values of the oxygen diffusion coefficient in the cathode and the relatively high separator/anode and separator/cathode interface resistances.

from test: 1 The model presented below is based on the theory of concentrated solutions7 to describe the transport of Li+ and O2 in the anode protective layer (APL), separator, and cathode electrolyte. We consider a binary monovalent organic electrolyte in the APL and aqueous electrolyte in the cathode, with no convection. After the concentration of Li ions becomes equal to cLi, sat, we assume that LiOH · H2O precipitates on the surface of the carbon at the same location where reaction 3 took place. We believe that this is a good approximation in the case of batteries with no convection because reaction 3 takes place at the surface of carbon and there is little probability that the resulting reaction product will deposit at a different location. However, if the electrolyte is flowing in the cathode such as in the case of Li-air flow batteries,8,9, the LiOH · H2O reaction product might deposit at a different location inside the cathode. In addition, if we coat the surface of the carbon or separator with different polymers layers, the lithium hydroxide might not stick on the surface of the carbon or separator and precipitate somewhere else in the aqueous compartment.10
from Soup: 1 There is a constant interest in developing battery cells with high energy density storage. This interest is driven not only by industries requiring high electric power such as the electric car industry who requires fundamental improvements in the current Li-ion technology in order to extend the driving range of current electric vehicles, but also by many low-power electronics industries which require light, high-capacity energy storage devices. Li-air batteries have the potential to become one of the best candidates for both industries because of their high theoretical energy density, which is almost one order of magnitude larger than that of Li-ion batteries. 1 – 3 The high capacity of Li-air batteries is partly due to the fact that the active material is not stored in the battery but is taken from the atmosphere. Computer-aided-design can help designing Li-air batteries in order to improve the power density and cyclability of these batteries.

from Soup: 2 Depending on the type of the electrolyte that they use, Li-air batteries can be divided in Li-air batteries with organic electrolyte and Li-air batteries with dual electrolyte (i.e. organic electrolyte at the anode and aqueous electrolyte at the cathode). In the case of Li-air batteries with organic electrolyte 2 the discharge product deposits on the surface of the carbon, while in the case of the batteries with dual electrolyte 4 , 5 , the discharge product is soluble in the water at the cathode. This fact makes Li-air batteries with dual electrolyte very attractive because one can use air electrodes having a fuel cell structure to continuously eliminate the discharge product from the cathode. In this article we focus on the modeling of Li-air batteries with dual electrolyte, and develop a physics-based framework for the simulation of these batteries. The model is based on the mass transport equations of the materials involved in the system and can be easily discretized on a finite-element grid and used for the design process.

from Soup: 3 Li-air batteries with aqueous electrolyte are usually made of a Li metallic anode with organic electrolyte, a solid separator such as a lithium-ion conducting glass-ceramic (LIC-GC), and a porous carbon cathode filled with aqueous electrolyte (see Fig. 1 ). External air is allowed to penetrate inside the pores of the cathode, diffuse through the electrolyte, and react with the Li + ions coming from the anode. Depending on the concentration of the aqueous electrolyte in the cathode one distinguishes two regimes of operation:

When all the pores from the air side of the cathode are blocked, reaction 3 cannot take place anymore and the battery cannot be further discharged. As in the case of Li-air batteries with organic electrolyte, 3 , 6 , the formation and deposition of the discharge product in the channels constitute the main reasons for the relatively short life of Li-air batteries.

Details about the derivation of transport equations are presented in the Appendix. In the second section of the article, we present the numerical algorithm and simulation results. It is shown that the power density can be slightly improved by increasing the solubility factor, oxygen diffusion coefficient, or using a catalyst in the cathode. The energy density and specific capacity of these batteries can be improved by increasing the solubility factor and oxygen diffusion coefficient; however, they are not much affected by using a uniformly distributed catalyst in the cathode.

The bulk resistance of the LIC-GC membrane and interfacial resistance between the membrane and electrolyte were obtained by fitting EIS using the equivalent electric circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 2. Resistance Rb represents the total bulk resistance of the LIC-GC membrane and electrolytes. The two parallel combinations of resistors and capacitors represent the interfacial impedances at the two interfaces. The resistance of the electrolyte was measured by removing the LIC-GC membrane when the same electrolyte was used in both electrolyte cells and subtracted from the EIS as shown in Fig. 5. The resistance distribution can be summarized as follows: the bulk resistance of LIC-GC membrane was Rb∼50 Ω-cm2 which is equivalent to a conductivity of 1×10−4 S/cm; the interfacial resistances were Rint1∼70 Ω-cm2 with the aqueous electrolyte (1 M LiOH solution) and Rint2∼80 Ω-cm2 with the non-aqueous electrolyte (1M LiPF6 in PC), respectively; therefore, the total cell resistance at low frequencies was about 200 Ω-cm2.

This fact is illustrated in the simulations presented in Fig. 7, where the maximum concentration of Li+ ions in the cathode is represented as a function of the specific capacity at a very low discharge current. Since the discharge current is constant the maximum concentration of Li+ ions increases linearly till cLi = cLi, sat. After this point the maximum concentration of Li+ ions remains constant till the whole cathode volume is filled in with LiOH · H2O(deposit). The specific capacity of the battery before saturation SC1 and the total specific capacity SCmax are in full agreement with the theoretical predictions 40 and 43, respectively.

Before Li+ saturation the porosity of the cathode is constant and equal to its initial value 75%. After Li+ saturation the specific capacity depends on the value of the discharge current: for very low discharge currents the specific capacity is approximately equal to the maximum theoretical value SCmax ; for high discharge currents (> 1 mA/cm2) the specific capacity decreases to SC1.

The inset shows a detail of these curves at the beginning of the discharge process, when the quasi-stationary regime is obtained [see Eq. 27]. During this time, the concentration of the oxygen in the cathode is relatively high, which explains the slightly high values of the cell voltage. The maximum in the inset of Fig. 9 is due to the fact that the initial concentration of the electrolyte is very small (cLi, 0 = 10−6 cm−3), which results in a low electrical conductivity, hence a slightly lower voltage; in our simulations, this maximum disappears when the initial concentration of the electrolyte is larger than 10−5 cm−3. In practical applications, it might be difficult to observe it because quite often the electrolyte has a small concentration due to various salt impurities.

The discharge current in all simulations is 0.1 mA/cm2. The saturation of the lithium concentration is achieved when the state-of-discharge becomes equal to . Initially, the porosity decreases more or less uniformly throughout the cathode, but in the last 30% of the discharge cycle the decrease rate accelerates toward the air side of the cathode. Hence, in order to increase the life time of Li-air batteries, it is desirable if possible to not fully discharge these batteries but recharge them as soon as their state-of-discharge gets close to 70%. Otherwise, defects and nonuniformities induced by the reaction product might damage the battery irreversibly. The oxygen concentration is almost 50% smaller in the left side of the cathode than in the right side during the initial 50% discharge period of the battery. However, the more we discharge the battery, the narrower the oxygen transport channels become, the oxygen cannot penetrate easily inside the cathode, and the oxygen concentration decreases at the separator side. The reaction rate is almost uniform during the initial discharge period of the battery, however, as the discharge progresses, it increases relatively fast in the region close to the air side and decreases in the region close to the separator.

from test: 65 It is apparent from the above discussion that the energy and power densities of the Li-air batteries are limited by the relatively low oxygen diffusion rate inside the cathode. Hence, in order to improve the energy and power densities of these batteries we should increase the oxygen solubility14 and diffusion coefficients in the cathode. Figs. 14 and 15 present the energy density, power density, and the specific capacity of the cell as a function of the oxygen solubility factor and oxygen diffusion coefficient respectively. The energy density, power density, and the specific capacity increase with the values of the solubility factor and oxygen diffusion coefficient. However, while the increase of the power density with respect to the solubility factor is approximately linear, the increase with respect to the oxygen diffusion coefficient seems to saturate when cm2/s.

In these simulations the reaction rate is assumed uniformly constant thought the cathode. We observe that although the energy and power densities are predicted to increase by at most 10% due to the introduction of the catalyst, the specific capacity of the battery does not increase. The energy density is maximum when the reaction rate is approximately equal to 4×107 A/cm2 but this maximum depends on the characteristics of the battery such as geometry, discharge current, and other model specific parameters. The decrease of the energy density and specific capacity at high values of the reaction rate coefficient is due to the fact that the reaction rate increases significantly in the right side of the cathode and the deposited LiOH · H2O blocks faster the flow of the oxygen.

It takes approximately 50 min for the battery to saturate the electrolyte in the cathode at a discharge current of 10 mA/cm2. As also observed experimentally,4 the output characteristics are significantly affected by the high separator/anode and separator/cathode interface resistance. The maximum of the power density is obtain for a discharge current of approximately 7 mA/cm2, which is slightly lower than the value obtained by Wang et al.,4 11 mA/cm2 because the total interface resistance in our battery is 150 Ω compared to approximately 100 Ω in Ref. 4. The interface resistance is known to vary significantly with the type of the solvent and electrolyte concentration. The initial variation of the I-V curves at high discharge currents is due again to the fact that the initial concentration of the electrolyte in simulations is very small (cLi, 0 = 10−6 cm−3). In normal applications this effect is usually not observed because the electrolyte might already contain a significant initial amount of lithium ions.

from test: 95 There is a constant interest in developing battery cells with high energy density storage. This interest is driven not only by industries requiring high electric power such as the electric car industry who requires fundamental improvements in the current Li-ion technology in order to extend the driving range of current electric vehicles, but also by many low-power electronics industries which require light, high-capacity energy storage devices. Li-air batteries have the potential to become one of the best candidates for both industries because of their high theoretical energy density, which is almost one order of magnitude larger than that of Li-ion batteries.1–3 The high capacity of Li-air batteries is partly due to the fact that the active material is not stored in the battery but is taken from the atmosphere. Computer-aided-design can help designing Li-air batteries in order to improve the power density and cyclability of these batteries.

from test: 96 Depending on the type of the electrolyte that they use, Li-air batteries can be divided in Li-air batteries with organic electrolyte and Li-air batteries with dual electrolyte (i.e. organic electrolyte at the anode and aqueous electrolyte at the cathode). In the case of Li-air batteries with organic electrolyte2 the discharge product deposits on the surface of the carbon, while in the case of the batteries with dual electrolyte4,5, the discharge product is soluble in the water at the cathode. This fact makes Li-air batteries with dual electrolyte very attractive because one can use air electrodes having a fuel cell structure to continuously eliminate the discharge product from the cathode. In this article we focus on the modeling of Li-air batteries with dual electrolyte, and develop a physics-based framework for the simulation of these batteries. The model is based on the mass transport equations of the materials involved in the system and can be easily discretized on a finite-element grid and used for the design process.

from test: 97 Li-air batteries with aqueous electrolyte are usually made of a Li metallic anode with organic electrolyte, a solid separator such as a lithium-ion conducting glass-ceramic (LIC-GC), and a porous carbon cathode filled with aqueous electrolyte (see Fig. 1). External air is allowed to penetrate inside the pores of the cathode, diffuse through the electrolyte, and react with the Li+ ions coming from the anode. Depending on the concentration of the aqueous electrolyte in the cathode one distinguishes two regimes of operation:

from test: 100 The chemical reactions can be summarized as follows:
from test: 101 When the concentration of Li+ and OH− ions reaches the concentration of saturation of Li+OH− in water, cLi, sat, the LiOH · H2O deposits on the surface of the carbon, thus filling in the pores of the porous cathode and eventually interrupting the flow of the O2 in the cathode (see Fig. 3). When all the pores from the air side of the cathode are blocked, reaction 3 cannot take place anymore and the battery cannot be further discharged. As in the case of Li-air batteries with organic electrolyte,3,6, the formation and deposition of the discharge product in the channels constitute the main reasons for the relatively short life of Li-air batteries.
from test: 102 The article is structured as follows. In the first section we summarize the model that we use for the simulation of Li-air batteries. This model is similar to the one that we developed for the simulation of Li-air batteries with organic electrolyte,6 however it takes into consideration the saturation and deposition of the LiOH · H2O discharge product at the cathode, as well as the appropriate source terms for the transport equations. Details about the derivation of transport equations are presented in the Appendix. In the second section of the article, we present the numerical algorithm and simulation results. It is shown that the power density can be slightly improved by increasing the solubility factor, oxygen diffusion coefficient, or using a catalyst in the cathode. The energy density and specific capacity of these batteries can be improved by increasing the solubility factor and oxygen diffusion coefficient; however, they are not much affected by using a uniformly distributed catalyst in the cathode.
