from test: 0 The performance degradation of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is studied in the presence of HCl in the air stream. The cathode employing carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles (Pt/C) was exposed to 4 ppm HCl in air while the cell voltage was held at 0.6 V. The HCl poisoning results in generation of chloride and chloroplatinate ions on the surface of Pt/C catalyst as determined by a combination of electrochemical tests and ex-situ chlorine K-edge X-Ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The chloride ions inhibit the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and likely affect the wetting properties of diffusion media/catalyst layer, while the chloroplatinate ions are responsible for enhanced platinum particle growth most likely due to platinum dissolution-redeposition. The chloride ions can cause corrosion of the Pt nanoparticles in the presence of aqueous HCl in air even if no potential is applied. Although the majority of chloride ions are desorbed from the Pt surface by hydrogen treatment of the cathode, they partially remain in the system and re-adsorb on platinum at cell voltages of 0.5–0.9 V. Chloride ions are removed from the system and fuel cell performance at 0.5−0.7 V is restored by multiple exposures to low potentials.

from test: 1 FC tests were performed on GORE PRIMEA Membrane Electrode Sub-Gasket Assembly series catalyst coated membranes (CCMs) employing Pt/C catalyst (both at the anode and cathode) deposited on 18 μm thick GORE-SELECT membrane. The Pt loading at the anode|cathode was 0.4 mgPt cm−2 and the catalyst-coated area was 25 cm2. The CCMs were made into membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs) by sandwiching between two gas diffusion layers (GDLs) and mounted into a 25 cm2 fuel cell test fixture with graphite triple serpentine flow fields (Fuel Cell Technologies). Two types of GDLs were used: Sigracet 25BC (236 μm, SGL Group) and AvCarb EP40 (170 μm, Ballard). AvCarb EP40 GDLs were used for FC tests followed by ex-situ XANES and HRTEM experiments, as they could be easily peeled off MEAs to isolate the CCMs. Once mounted in the FC test fixture, the resulting single cell was connected to the FC test station (890C, Scribner Associates, Inc.) and activated using previously described “break-in” procedure.10 To avoid corrosion of the FC tubing and hardware in the presence of 4 ppm HCl in air, only teflon tubing and fittings were employed in the gas supply lines. No metal parts were exposed to HCl in air in the FC hardware. Visual inspection of graphite flow fields did not reveal any signs of corrosion after exposure to HCl in air.
from Soup: 1 Sodium chloride is a major component of sea water and air mists that can significantly affect performance of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) used in a marine environment. The effect of sodium chloride solution on FC performance has previously been evaluated by several researchers 1 – 3 and reviewed elsewhere. 4 Sodium chloride introduced at the cathode of the PEMFC causes significant performance degradation 1 , 2 due to additive effects of sodium and chloride ions. 1 Mikkola et al. 2 observed the effect of sodium ions only in their experiments, possibly implying that, under certain conditions, chloride ions may be rejected by the proton exchange ionomer inside the structure of the catalyst layer. Sodium ions were found to decrease the proton conductivity of the cell due to replacement of protons by sodium ions in the Nafion ionomer, 1 , 2 while the presence of chloride ions led to a decrease in the platinum electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and inhibition of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). 1 – 3 , 5 Chloride ions have been shown to inhibit the ORR by reversible adsorption on platinum surface as studied at the electrode/solution interface. 6
 ###### 
from test: 2 The FC cathodes were exposed to 4 ppm HCl in air for 20 h under constant flow rates of 0.4|1.0 l min−1 at the anode|cathode, while the cell voltage was held at 0.6 V. The cell was maintained under ambient pressure, at 80°C and 100% relative humidity. Ultra-high purity hydrogen (99.999%, GTS-Welco) and ultrazero synthetic air (GTS-Welco) were used to feed the fuel cells. The 4 ppm HCl in air was obtained by diluting the 46 ppm HCl in ultrazero air (GTS-Welco) with humidified air supplied through the fuel cell test station.
from Soup: 2 Pt ECSA loss in FCs in the presence of chloride ions has been linked to platinum dissolution according to equations below 7 where E 0 and SHE stand for the standard electrode potential and standard hydrogen electrode, respectively.
 ###### 
from test: 3 Exposure to 4 ppm HCl in a typical experiment was preceded by a 3 h and followed by a 1 h air purge. After the final air purge, either cyclic voltammetry (CV) or polarization curves were measured following methodology described elsewhere.11 In order to measure CV curves, the cell and humidifiers were cooled down to 30 and 50°C, respectively, while the air flow was replaced by a flow of UHP nitrogen (GTS-Welco, 99.999%) at the cathode. The CV curves were recorded at 50 mV s−1 using Autolab PGSTAT30 potentiostat. H2|N2 flow rates at the anode|cathode were 0.25|0.05 l min−1.
from Soup: 3 Careful investigation of platinum electrodeposited films by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance confirmed platinum dissolution in 10 ppm aqueous chloride solutions at 1.06 V. 8 In FC experiments, Matsuoka et al. 7 found Pt deposited in the Nafion membrane after 50 h of FC testing in the presence of chloride ions in the air stream. Although the results of this experiment suggest platinum dissolution in the presence of chloride ions, no direct evidence of Pt dissolution in the FC environment according to Eqs. 1, 2 was provided.
 ###### 
from test: 4 The nitrogen flow was replaced by a flow of hydrogen at the cathode at a flow rate of 0.25 l min−1 in order to desorb chloride ions from the platinum surface. Exposure to H2|H2 for 1 h was followed by a H2|N2 purge until a stable OCV value was measured. This was followed by one more set of CV curves at 50 mV s−1.
from Soup: 4 Another negative effect of chloride ions may involve electrochemical generation of hydrogen peroxide which is detrimental to membrane/ionomer durability. Enhanced hydrogen peroxide generation in the presence of chloride ions was observed at the electrode/solution interface. 6 The ORR on the Pt (100) surface (the most affected by the adsorption of chloride ions) occurred through a 3.5 e − reduction involving hydrogen peroxide formation in the solution phase. We have also observed inhibition of the ORR and peroxide generation from exposure to sulfur-containing contaminants in rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) studies. 9
 ###### 
from test: 5 The CV measurements were accompanied by hydrogen crossover measurements.12 A linear potential scan of 1 mV s−1 was applied to the cathode over potential range between open circuit potential and 0.4 V (vs. potential at the anode) in order to determine hydrogen crossover current i x. Anode|cathode flow rates were 0.25|0.1 l min−1.
from Soup: 5 Here we resolve the mechanisms of the influence of chloride ions on FC degradation, and methods for performance recovery. To avoid complications caused by the presence of sodium ions, the chloride species were introduced in the form of gaseous HCl in air while the cell was held at a voltage of 0.6 V. This experimental approach is reminiscent of that used for studying cathode poisoning with sulfur species. 8 FC experiments are complemented by ex-situ chlorine K-edge X-Ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in order to get information on the nature of adsorbed chloride species and morphology of platinum nanoparticles, respectively. Different aspects of chloride adsorption on Pt/C catalysts are discussed along with the recovery strategies, mandatory for keeping the fuel cell in operating condition after being exposed to chloride ions.
 ###### 
from test: 6 A set of two polarization curves was measured either directly after exposure to 4 ppm HCl in air or after recording the CV curves. The polarization curves were acquired in H2|air at H2|O2 stoichiometric ratio (s) of 2|2 following protocol described in the literature.11

 ###### 
from test: 7 The platinum ECSA was determined from the hydrogen desorption region on the CV curves by integrating the area under the hydrogen desorption peak after the double-layer correction (subtracting the cathodic current on CV curve at 0.4 V from the total current). A factor of 210 μC cmPt −2 (Ref. 13) was used to convert the charge consumed for hydrogen desorption from Pt into platinum ECSA. All potentials related to FC measurements are given with respect to potential at the anode.
from Soup: 7 The FC cathodes were exposed to 4 ppm HCl in air for 20 h under constant flow rates of 0.4|1.0 l min −1 at the anode|cathode, while the cell voltage was held at 0.6 V.

from test: 8 Chlorine K-edge spectra were measured on the X15B beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source in Brookhaven National Lab. X15B was equipped with a double crystal Si(111) monochromator, with minimum energy resolution of 0.5 eV. The XANES spectra were acquired in fluorescence mode using a Canberra germanium solid-state detector cooled by liquid nitrogen and positioned 90° to the incident beam. The Chlorine K-edge fluorescence was separated from the detector spectrum. The incident beam intensity (I0) was measured using a windowless ionization chamber. Before collecting spectra, the beam was focused to a 1 mm2 spot size in the sample and the entire sample chamber was purged with helium at 1 atmosphere. More details on X15B beamline can be found on the NSLS website.14

 ###### 
from test: 9 The spectra for both chlorine standards and CCMs were collected by scanning incident energy from 2755 to 3000 eV, with a step size of 5 eV below 2805 and above 2850 eV. The step sizes across the edge (2805–2850 eV) were smaller: 0.25 eV between 2805 and 2835 eV and 0.5 eV between 2835 and 2850 eV. The acquisition time for each point was 4 s. Each spectrum was measured at least three times and the average of the three trials is presented.
from Soup: 9 The nitrogen flow was replaced by a flow of hydrogen at the cathode at a flow rate of 0.25 l min −1 in order to desorb chloride ions from the platinum surface.

 ###### 
from test: 10 The X-Ray energy was calibrated to the K-edge of NaCl (GFS Chemicals, ACS grade), which was set to 2832 eV. Other standards included PtCl2 (Alfa Aesar, ACS grade) and H2PtCl6 (Alfa Aesar, ACS grade). Powder standards were finely ground and placed into envelopes made of 5 μm-thick polypropylene film (SPEXCertiPrep, Inc) before mounting into the sample holder.
from Soup: 10 The CV measurements were accompanied by hydrogen crossover measurements. 12 A linear potential scan of 1 mV s −1 was applied to the cathode over potential range between open circuit potential and 0.4 V (vs. potential at the anode) in order to determine hydrogen crossover current i x . Anode|cathode flow rates were 0.25|0.1 l min −1 .
 ###### 
from test: 11 Another group of samples consisted of pieces of Gore CCMs soaked for 1 h in nanopure water (Millipore, 18 MΩ cm, 7 ppb of total organic carbon) or a 0.1 M aqueous HCl solution. Before exposure to H2O or HCl solution, ∼1 cm2 pieces of the CCMs were sonicated for 1–2 min in an ultrasonic bath to make the surface of the CCMs wettable. After exposure to the 0.1 M HCl solution, each CCM was rinsed 5–6 times in nanopure water.
from Soup: 11 A set of two polarization curves was measured either directly after exposure to 4 ppm HCl in air or after recording the CV curves. The polarization curves were acquired in H 2 |air at H 2 |O 2 stoichiometric ratio ( s ) of 2|2 following protocol described in the literature. 11
 ###### 
from test: 12 The last group of samples for XANES analysis consisted of Gore CCMs taken from FCs exposed to 4 ppm HCl in air, following the procedure described above. The FCs were cooled down to 30°C after exposure to HCl, while flowing H2|N2 at the anode|cathode. Care was taken to not exceed 0.6 V when air flow was replaced by N2 flow. One of the fuel cells was additionally treated under H2|H2 at 0.25|0.25 L min−1 for 1 h, before the final H2|N2 purge. Afterwards, the fuel cells were disassembled and the membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs) were sealed in plastic bags. The GDLs were peeled off the MEAs to expose the surface of the CCMs for the XANES measurements. 5 mm × 5 mm pieces of CCMs were placed into polypropylene envelopes and mounted in the sample holder.
from Soup: 12 The platinum ECSA was determined from the hydrogen desorption region on the CV curves by integrating the area under the hydrogen desorption peak after the double-layer correction (subtracting the cathodic current on CV curve at 0.4 V from the total current). A factor of 210 μ C cm Pt −2 (Ref. 13 ) was used to convert the charge consumed for hydrogen desorption from Pt into platinum ECSA. All potentials related to FC measurements are given with respect to potential at the anode.

from test: 13 The surface morphology and Pt particle size distribution of carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles were examined by HRTEM using a JEOL JEM 2100 transmission electron microscope equipped with a Gatan Orius 1000 CCD camera and Oxford energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system. Images were taken in bright-field and high-angle annular dark field modes.

 ###### 
from test: 14 The catalyst samples were prepared by dispersing a catalyst powder scraped from as-prepared and contaminated CCMs in glass vials containing 2.5 ml of ethanol and ultrasonicating them to ensure uniform distribution of the catalyst. A droplet of the dispersion was placed on a carbon-coated copper grid and dried in air before HRTEM images were acquired. EDS and selected area diffraction were used to qualitatively confirm the composition of the catalysts as containing Pt nanoparticles on a graphitic carbon support. The particle size for each sample was determined by measuring the diameters and taking the average (mean) of a population of 200 individual particles from three or four randomly selected regions of the bright-field HRTEM images.

 ###### 
from test: 15 Figure 1 shows current density i vs. time curve measured during exposure of the FC cathode to 4 ppm HCl in air for 20 h when the cell voltage was held at 0.6 V. Exposure to HCl was preceded and followed by 3 and 30 h purges with neat air, respectively. The total dosage of HCl was 0.22 mmole.
from Soup: 15 The X-Ray energy was calibrated to the K-edge of NaCl (GFS Chemicals, ACS grade), which was set to 2832 eV. Other standards included PtCl 2 (Alfa Aesar, ACS grade) and H 2 PtCl 6 (Alfa Aesar, ACS grade). Powder standards were finely ground and placed into envelopes made of 5 μ m-thick polypropylene film (SPEXCertiPrep, Inc) before mounting into the sample holder.
 ###### 
from test: 16 Introduction of 4 ppm HCl in air does not result in immediate performance degradation of the FC; there is a 1 h delay between the time when HCl is introduced into the system and the degradation effect is observed. The 1 h delay is likely required for the negatively charged ions to cross the Nafion ionomer surrounding Pt nanoparticles in the catalyst layer. A gradual current decrease from 1.03 to 0.13 A cm−2 is observed after that, followed by an approaching plateau at 0.1 A cm−2. The current degradation rate does not remain constant with time: two well pronounced regions are observed on the i vs. time curve, with a faster degradation rate in the first region (1.03–0.5 A cm−2 for ca. 4 h) compared to the second one (0.5–0.13 A cm−2 for ca. 7 h).
from Soup: 16 Another group of samples consisted of pieces of Gore CCMs soaked for 1 h in nanopure water (Millipore, 18 MΩ cm, 7 ppb of total organic carbon) or a 0.1 M aqueous HCl solution. Before exposure to H 2 O or HCl solution, ∼1 cm 2 pieces of the CCMs were sonicated for 1–2 min in an ultrasonic bath to make the surface of the CCMs wettable. After exposure to the 0.1 M HCl solution, each CCM was rinsed 5–6 times in nanopure water.
 ###### 
from test: 17 A plateau on the i vs. time curve is likely due to the chloride coverage on the Pt reaching its maximum. A limiting coverage (i.e. coverage that does not change with increasing anion concentration) of ca. 0.7 monolayer (ML) has been measured for smooth polycrystalline platinum in the presence of chloride ions at 0.7 V vs. a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).15 Chloride coverage on Pt never reaches a full monolayer due to a repulsive lateral interaction of negatively charged chloride ions.
from Soup: 17 The last group of samples for XANES analysis consisted of Gore CCMs taken from FCs exposed to 4 ppm HCl in air, following the procedure described above. The FCs were cooled down to 30°C after exposure to HCl, while flowing H 2 |N 2 at the anode|cathode. Care was taken to not exceed 0.6 V when air flow was replaced by N 2 flow. One of the fuel cells was additionally treated under H 2 |H 2 at 0.25|0.25 L min −1 for 1 h, before the final H 2 |N 2 purge. Afterwards, the fuel cells were disassembled and the membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs) were sealed in plastic bags. The GDLs were peeled off the MEAs to expose the surface of the CCMs for the XANES measurements. 5 mm × 5 mm pieces of CCMs were placed into polypropylene envelopes and mounted in the sample holder.
 ###### 
from test: 18 The replacement of HCl in the air flow by a flow of neat air leads to partial FC performance recovery from 0.1 to 0.36 A cm−2, indicating a partial desorption of chloride ions from the platinum surface; however, no full recovery is observed even if the exposure time to neat air is extended to 100 h (not shown in the figure).
from Soup: 18 The surface morphology and Pt particle size distribution of carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles were examined by HRTEM using a JEOL JEM 2100 transmission electron microscope equipped with a Gatan Orius 1000 CCD camera and Oxford energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system. Images were taken in bright-field and high-angle annular dark field modes.
 ###### 
from test: 19 The polarization curves measured at the beginning of test (BOT, black solid circles) and after exposure of the FC cathode to 4 ppm HCl in air (red open stars) are shown in Fig. 2. Significant performance degradation in the HCl-contaminated FC is observed. A current decrease by a factor of four (from 0.97 to 0.23 A cm−2) is measured at 0.6 V. The FC performance is significantly improved after the H2-treatment of the cathode (blue solid and open symbols in Fig. 2). When the cathode is purged with H2, the OCV shifts to 0 V and the adsorbed hydrogen species replace the chloride ions on the platinum surface. Exposure to low potentials (0 V vs. SHE) was previously used by Bagotsky et al.15, 16 to desorb chloride ions from a platinum surface in aqueous 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions and by others10 to remove some other reversibly adsorbed anions, such as sulfate.
from Soup: 19 The catalyst samples were prepared by dispersing a catalyst powder scraped from as-prepared and contaminated CCMs in glass vials containing 2.5 ml of ethanol and ultrasonicating them to ensure uniform distribution of the catalyst. A droplet of the dispersion was placed on a carbon-coated copper grid and dried in air before HRTEM images were acquired.

The particle size for each sample was determined by measuring the diameters and taking the average (mean) of a population of 200 individual particles from three or four randomly selected regions of the bright-field HRTEM images.
 ###### 
from test: 20 Hydrogen purge was preceded by a nitrogen purge while the cell was cooled down from 80 to 30°C. During the nitrogen purge, the potential of the cathode decreases to an open circuit voltage of 0.07–0.09 V (for nitrogen flow rates of 0.05–0.1 l min−1). Although most of the chloride ions are desorbed from the platinum surface at these low potentials,15, 16 the chloride surface coverage remains appreciable. The presence of less than 0.1 ML of adsorbed chloride ions was still measured in the hydrogen adsorption region for Pt(111),16 as compared to 0.43 ML at 0.64V vs SHE in the presence of 0.01M KCl in electrolyte solution.
from Soup: 20 Figure 1 shows current density i vs. time curve measured during exposure of the FC cathode to 4 ppm HCl in air for 20 h when the cell voltage was held at 0.6 V. Exposure to HCl was preceded and followed by 3 and 30 h purges with neat air, respectively. The total dosage of HCl was 0.22 mmole.
 ###### 
from test: 21 The CV curves measured on the FC cathode after the cathode’s N2 and H2 purges are compared in Fig. 3a (red and green lines, respectively). The curve measured at the BOT is also shown in the same figure as a reference (black line). The presence of chloride ions on the surface after the N2 purge (red curve) is indicated by a decrease in the capacitance of the double electrical layer (∼ 0.4–0.6 V),17 a 10 mV positive shift in the peaks of oxidation and reduction of adsorbed oxygen species (near 0.8 V) and a 20 mV negative shift in the peak positions in the anodic part of hydrogen region (between 0.08 and 0.4 V). A delay in the adsorption of OHads groups due to adsorption of negatively charged ions on the anodic CV sweep has been previously observed not only for chloride, but for sulfate and cyanide ions as well.18, 19
from Soup: 21 Introduction of 4 ppm HCl in air does not result in immediate performance degradation of the FC; there is a 1 h delay between the time when HCl is introduced into the system and the degradation effect is observed. The 1 h delay is likely required for the negatively charged ions to cross the Nafion ionomer surrounding Pt nanoparticles in the catalyst layer. A gradual current decrease from 1.03 to 0.13 A cm −2 is observed after that, followed by an approaching plateau at 0.1 A cm −2 . The current degradation rate does not remain constant with time: two well pronounced regions are observed on the i vs. time curve, with a faster degradation rate in the first region (1.03–0.5 A cm −2 for ca. 4 h) compared to the second one (0.5–0.13 A cm −2 for ca. 7 h).
 ###### 
from test: 22 The major effect of the adsorbed chloride ions in the hydrogen adsorption/desorption region of the CV is the negative shift of the peak positions for hydrogen electrochemical adsorption/desorption. The areas under CV curves in the hydrogen adsorption and desorption regions remain almost unchanged, though. Pt ECSA values are 56 and 57 m2 gPt −1 for red and green curves, respectively. This agrees well with the previous results, where chloride ions were found to affect the energetics of hydrogen adsorption rather than the amount of adsorbed hydrogen.15
from Soup: 22 A plateau on the i vs. time curve is likely due to the chloride coverage on the Pt reaching its maximum. A limiting coverage (i.e. coverage that does not change with increasing anion concentration) of ca. 0.7 monolayer (ML) has been measured for smooth polycrystalline platinum in the presence of chloride ions at 0.7 V vs. a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). 15 Chloride coverage on Pt never reaches a full monolayer due to a repulsive lateral interaction of negatively charged chloride ions.
 ###### 
from test: 23 A remarkable 20% surface area loss (from 71 to 57 m2 gPt −1) is measured for a chloride-free platinum surface obtained after cathode H2-treatment (black and green lines, respectively). In addition to a decrease in the Pt ECSA, a positive ca. 25 mV shift is observed for the reduction peak in the cathodic part of the oxygen region near 0.78 V. Features at 0.15 and 0.2 V are shifted negatively by ca. 20 mV in the hydrogen desorption region, while a new feature at 0.25 V became noticeable after the chloride desorption from the platinum surface. The latter feature is usually assigned to hydrogen adsorption on Pt (100) planes17 and might suggest chloride-induced faceting of Pt nanoparticles, similar to the sulfur-induced faceting.20 Strong adsorption of chloride ions on Pt (100) single crystals resulting in significant inhibition and changing the pathway of the ORR was reported by Stamenkovic et al.17
from Soup: 23 The replacement of HCl in the air flow by a flow of neat air leads to partial FC performance recovery from 0.1 to 0.36 A cm −2 , indicating a partial desorption of chloride ions from the platinum surface; however, no full recovery is observed even if the exposure time to neat air is extended to 100 h (not shown in the figure).
 ###### 
from test: 24 A negative shift of the features on the CV in the hydrogen region and the positive shift in the oxygen region after chloride desorption from the platinum surface (green curve in Fig. 3a) imply that the decrease in the platinum ECSA may be accompanied by particle growth.21 Because platinum particle growth can also occur in neat air, a control experiment in neat air was carried out in the same manner as for HCl in air. The CV curve measured after the completion of this experiment is shown in Fig. 3b (green line). Ca. 6% Pt ECSA loss (from 71 to 67 m2 gPt−1) is measured after holding the cell voltage at 0.6 V for 20 h. A more pronounced Pt ECSA loss (15% vs. 6%) combined with a ∼ 20 mV positive shift (from 0.76 to 0.78 V) in the reduction peak in the oxygen region confirms more significant particle growth in the presence of chloride species in the air stream.
from Soup: 24 The polarization curves measured at the beginning of test (BOT, black solid circles) and after exposure of the FC cathode to 4 ppm HCl in air (red open stars) are shown in Fig. 2 . Significant performance degradation in the HCl-contaminated FC is observed. A current decrease by a factor of four (from 0.97 to 0.23 A cm −2 ) is measured at 0.6 V. The FC performance is significantly improved after the H 2 -treatment of the cathode (blue solid and open symbols in Fig. 2 ). When the cathode is purged with H 2 , the OCV shifts to 0 V and the adsorbed hydrogen species replace the chloride ions on the platinum surface. Exposure to low potentials (0 V vs. SHE) was previously used by Bagotsky et al. 15 , 16 to desorb chloride ions from a platinum surface in aqueous 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 solutions and by others 10 to remove some other reversibly adsorbed anions, such as sulfate.
 ###### 
from test: 25 The particle growth after cathode exposure to HCl was confirmed by HRTEM analysis of the catalyst samples scraped from the cathode CCM surface after disassembling the FC and MEA. Figure 4 shows an HRTEM micrographs of the fresh Pt/C cathode catalyst (Fig. 4a), the one exposed to HCl (Fig. 4b), and another exposed to neat air (Fig. 4c). The anode catalyst after the FC cathode exposure to HCl in air is also shown in Fig. 4d. Figure 5 shows the particle size distribution for the catalyst samples presented in Fig. 4. The Pt nanoparticles in a fresh sample have an average particle size of 2.34 ± 0.39 nm. The particles are well dispersed and uniformly distributed on the surface of the carbon support (Fig. 4a). The Pt particles in the HCl-exposed cathode (Fig. 4b) are larger (4.36 ± 1.02 nm) and more agglomerated than those from a fresh sample (Fig. 4a) and the one taken from a FC cathode exposed to neat air (3.48 ± 0.84 nm). The particle size distribution is much broader both for the sample exposed to 4 ppm HCl in air (Fig. 5b) and neat air (Fig. 5c) compared to a fresh sample (Fig. 5a). The shape of the particle size distribution is also different for the three samples. It is characterized by a well pronounced tail towards larger particle size for the cathode exposed to air (Fig. 5c), while it has more symmetry around the maximum for the cathode catalyst exposed to HCl in air (Fig. 5b). The particle size distribution for the fresh sample is uniformly centered around the maximum (Fig. 5a). The different shape of the particle size distribution for the cathode catalyst exposed to HCl in air vs. neat air may suggest different mechanism of particle growth.
from Soup: 25 Hydrogen purge was preceded by a nitrogen purge while the cell was cooled down from 80 to 30°C. During the nitrogen purge, the potential of the cathode decreases to an open circuit voltage of 0.07–0.09 V (for nitrogen flow rates of 0.05–0.1 l min −1 ). Although most of the chloride ions are desorbed from the platinum surface at these low potentials, 15 , 16 the chloride surface coverage remains appreciable. The presence of less than 0.1 ML of adsorbed chloride ions was still measured in the hydrogen adsorption region for Pt(111), 16 as compared to 0.43 ML at 0.64V vs SHE in the presence of 0.01M KCl in electrolyte solution.
 ###### 
from test: 26 The particles at the anode after the cathode’s exposure to HCl (Fig. 4d) show the least growth vs. the fresh sample (2.57 ± 0.44 nm vs. 2.34 ± 0.39 nm, respectively). They are also well dispersed and uniformly distributed on the carbon surface. Insignificant particle growth at the anode vs. the cathode indicates that either chloride ions do not cross the Nafion membrane or they cross the membrane, but have little or no effect on particle growth. The last scenario was demonstrated by Li et al.5 when studying the FC degradation due to exposure to HCl at experimental conditions different from those implemented in our experiments (higher HCl exposure levels, 25 psig inlet pressure at the anode|cathode and lower Pt loading at the anode). Observation of crossover of chloride ions through the Nafion membrane by Li et al. can provide new insights on the properties of proton exchange membranes as the negatively charged ions are expected to be rejected by the proton exchange membrane until Donnan’s exclusion limit is exceeded.22–24 We don’t observe crossover of chloride ions under our experimental conditions based on measurements of hydrogen crossover current and CV curves at the anode after the cathode exposure to HCl in air.
from Soup: 26 The CV curves measured on the FC cathode after the cathode’s N 2 and H 2 purges are compared in Fig. 3a (red and green lines, respectively). The curve measured at the BOT is also shown in the same figure as a reference (black line). The presence of chloride ions on the surface after the N 2 purge (red curve) is indicated by a decrease in the capacitance of the double electrical layer (∼ 0.4–0.6 V), 17 a 10 mV positive shift in the peaks of oxidation and reduction of adsorbed oxygen species (near 0.8 V) and a 20 mV negative shift in the peak positions in the anodic part of hydrogen region (between 0.08 and 0.4 V). A delay in the adsorption of OH ads groups due to adsorption of negatively charged ions on the anodic CV sweep has been previously observed not only for chloride, but for sulfate and cyanide ions as well. 18 , 19
 ###### 
from test: 27 Thus, both the electrochemical and the HRTEM results confirm accelerated platinum particle growth after the exposure of the FC cathode to 4 ppm HCl in air. We hypothesize that this is due to the generation of [PtCl6]2− ions in the catalyst layer in the presence of chloride species in the air stream. Accelerated growth of carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles in the presence of PtCl4 in acidic solution was demonstrated by Vikar et al.25 when studying the mechanisms of catalyst degradation in PEMFCs. The platinum ions generated by dissolution of PtCl4 in dilute HNO3 solution were most likely the ions of six-coordinated platinum [PtClx(NO3)6−x]2−, where x falls in the range from 1 to 6.
from Soup: 27 The major effect of the adsorbed chloride ions in the hydrogen adsorption/desorption region of the CV is the negative shift of the peak positions for hydrogen electrochemical adsorption/desorption. The areas under CV curves in the hydrogen adsorption and desorption regions remain almost unchanged, though. Pt ECSA values are 56 and 57 m 2 g Pt −1 for red and green curves, respectively. This agrees well with the previous results, where chloride ions were found to affect the energetics of hydrogen adsorption rather than the amount of adsorbed hydrogen. 15
 ###### 
from test: 28 We used ex-situ chlorine K-edge XANES to demonstrate that chloroplatinate ions are generated inside the structure of the catalyst layer when the cathode catalyst is exposed to HCl in air.
from Soup: 28 A remarkable 20% surface area loss (from 71 to 57 m 2 g Pt −1 ) is measured for a chloride-free platinum surface obtained after cathode H 2 -treatment (black and green lines, respectively). In addition to a decrease in the Pt ECSA, a positive ca. 25 mV shift is observed for the reduction peak in the cathodic part of the oxygen region near 0.78 V. Features at 0.15 and 0.2 V are shifted negatively by ca. 20 mV in the hydrogen desorption region, while a new feature at 0.25 V became noticeable after the chloride desorption from the platinum surface. The latter feature is usually assigned to hydrogen adsorption on Pt (100) planes 17 and might suggest chloride-induced faceting of Pt nanoparticles, similar to the sulfur-induced faceting. 20 Strong adsorption of chloride ions on Pt (100) single crystals resulting in significant inhibition and changing the pathway of the ORR was reported by Stamenkovic et al. 17
 ###### 
from test: 29 Figure 6 shows the pre-edge-background corrected and normalized to a step size of unity chlorine K-edge XANES spectra of three solid chlorine standards: NaCl (a, green), PtCl2(b, black) and H2PtCl6(c, red). The spectrum of NaCl is characterized by an absorption edge maximum at 2832 ± 0.2 eV, while two other spectra have sharp pre-edge maxima at 2827.5 ± 0.2 eV (PtCl2) and 2825.7 ± 0.2 eV (H2PtCl6), in addition to absorption edge maxima at 2834.6 and 2836.7 eV for H2PtCl6 and PtCl2, respectively. The sharp pre-edge maxima for PtCl2 and H2PtCl6 are characteristics of specific metal-ligand bonding in these two molecules.26 Pre-edge features were reported for other metal-chloride coordination complexes.27 They have been assigned to forbidden 1s → d transitions that become partially allowed due to mixing of metal d-orbitals and ligand p-orbitals.28–30
from Soup: 29 A negative shift of the features on the CV in the hydrogen region and the positive shift in the oxygen region after chloride desorption from the platinum surface (green curve in Fig. 3a ) imply that the decrease in the platinum ECSA may be accompanied by particle growth. 21 Because platinum particle growth can also occur in neat air, a control experiment in neat air was carried out in the same manner as for HCl in air. The CV curve measured after the completion of this experiment is shown in Fig. 3b (green line). Ca. 6% Pt ECSA loss (from 71 to 67 m 2 gPt −1 ) is measured after holding the cell voltage at 0.6 V for 20 h. A more pronounced Pt ECSA loss (15% vs. 6%) combined with a ∼ 20 mV positive shift (from 0.76 to 0.78 V) in the reduction peak in the oxygen region confirms more significant particle growth in the presence of chloride species in the air stream.
 ###### 
from test: 30 The positions of the peaks in chlorine K-edge XANES spectra shown in Figure 6 are significantly different for three compounds with a formal chlorine oxidation state of −1, suggesting that these spectra can be used to distinguish between chloride species embedded in different environments.
from Soup: 30 The particle growth after cathode exposure to HCl was confirmed by HRTEM analysis of the catalyst samples scraped from the cathode CCM surface after disassembling the FC and MEA. Figure 4 shows an HRTEM micrographs of the fresh Pt/C cathode catalyst (Fig. 4a ), the one exposed to HCl (Fig. 4b ), and another exposed to neat air (Fig. 4c ). The anode catalyst after the FC cathode exposure to HCl in air is also shown in Fig. 4d . Figure 5 shows the particle size distribution for the catalyst samples presented in Fig. 4 . The Pt nanoparticles in a fresh sample have an average particle size of 2.34 ± 0.39 nm. The particles are well dispersed and uniformly distributed on the surface of the carbon support (Fig. 4a ).

from test: 31 Figure 7 show ex-situ XANES spectrum recorded for a Gore CCM from a FC exposed to 4 ppm HCl in air (a, black line) at 0.6 V compared to spectra of NaCl (b, green) and H2PtCl6 (b, red) standards. A sharp peak at 2825 ± 0.2 eV is observed in the spectrum of the Gore CCM in the same region of photon energies as that of the H2PtCl6 standard (red). The presence of this peak indicates that part of the platinum atoms on the surface of the nanoparticles is likely dissolved to stable [PtCl6]2− ions. This peak, however, becomes much less pronounced after the cathode H2-treatment (a, blue line in Fig. 7). It implies that the cathode H2-treatment after exposure to HCl in air results not only in desorption of chloride ions from the surface, but also in the reduction of the chloroplatinate ions. As a result, the absorption edge maximum at 2834.5 ± 0.2eV shifts by 2 eV towards NaCl standard, implying that chloride ions were generated during reduction of [PtCl6]2− ions. Even though these chloride ions are not adsorbed on the platinum surface (as they are not seen on CVs), they are likely present on the surface of Vulcan carbon or the Nafion ionomer.
from Soup: 31 The particles at the anode after the cathode’s exposure to HCl (Fig. 4d ) show the least growth vs. the fresh sample (2.57 ± 0.44 nm vs. 2.34 ± 0.39 nm, respectively).

 ###### 
from test: 32 To further explore the nature of the pre-edge peak on a XANES spectrum for CCM exposed to HCl in air at the FC cathode, a spectrum of a fresh Gore CCM soaked in 0.1M HCl solution for 2 h was measured (red line in Fig. 8a). The striking feature of this graph is that, when normalized to a step size of unity, this spectrum becomes almost indistinguishable from the spectrum of the CCM exposed to HCl in air (black line in Fig. 8a), meaning that the platinum atoms dissolve (corrode) in the presence of HCl solution in air. To ensure that the pre-edge peak on XANES spectrum for HCl-soaked CCM does not originate from nanopure water (used for 0.1M HCl solution preparation) or trace chloride impurities in the fresh CCM, a spectrum was recorded for a fresh CCM soaked in nanopure water (blue line in Fig. 8b). Although this spectrum is much noisier than the other spectra presented in Figure 8 due to much lower chloride concentrations, the chloride features in the spectrum can be clearly distinguished when comparing to the NaCl standard (green curve in Fig. 8b). The spectrum contains a shoulder at 2822–2828 eV instead of pre-edge peak, and aligns reasonably well with a spectrum of the NaCl standard at photon energies higher than 2830 eV. The shape of the spectrum suggests that the majority of chloride species in this sample are free chloride ions, but not chloroplatinate ions. Obviously, these trace chloride ions do not affect the shape of the XANES spectrum from the HCl-soaked CCM.
from Soup: 32 Thus, both the electrochemical and the HRTEM results confirm accelerated platinum particle growth after the exposure of the FC cathode to 4 ppm HCl in air. We hypothesize that this is due to the generation of [PtCl 6 ] 2− ions in the catalyst layer in the presence of chloride species in the air stream. Accelerated growth of carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles in the presence of PtCl 4 in acidic solution was demonstrated by Vikar et al. 25 when studying the mechanisms of catalyst degradation in PEMFCs. The platinum ions generated by dissolution of PtCl 4 in dilute HNO 3 solution were most likely the ions of six-coordinated platinum [PtCl x (NO 3 ) 6−x ] 2− , where x falls in the range from 1 to 6.
 ###### 
from test: 33 Why are platinum nanoparticles not stable in the presence of HCl solution? Dissolution of noble metals in the presence of ions that can form stable metal-ion complexes has been reported previously.13 For example, gold dissolves in the presence of KCl and dissolved O2.13 Metal dissolution in the presence of a ligand forming stable metal complex is usually assigned to the negative shifting in the equilibrium potential for metal dissolution (see Eqs. 1, 2). When the equilibrium potential for metal dissolution becomes more negative than that of the ORR (1.23 V at 25°C),13 metal dissolution becomes possible in the oxygen-rich environment most likely according to the reaction in Eq. 3
from Soup: 33 We used ex-situ chlorine K-edge XANES to demonstrate that chloroplatinate ions are generated inside the structure of the catalyst layer when the cathode catalyst is exposed to HCl in air.
 ###### 
from test: 34 The difference between chloride ions and other impurities, such as sulfur compounds, is that they are retained in the cathode compartment after being desorbed from the platinum surface.2 As an illustration of such behavior, the second polarization curve in Figure 2 (open blue pentagons) measured after chloride desorption from the surface shows further performance decay vs. the first curve (solid blue pentagons). This suggests that the chloride ions re-adsorb on platinum surface at cell voltages of 0.5–0.9 V. Re-adsorption appears to be a slow process, as performance degradation becomes more pronounced with every consecutive polarization curve. The source of chloride ions is the cathode graphite components, i.e. flow channels and GDL. The presence of NaCl in the flow channels and GDL after cathode exposure to NaCl solution was confirmed by X-Ray fluorescence spectroscopy.2 Distinct chloride signal was observed on the XANES spectrum of GDL after cathode exposure to 4 ppm HCl in air in our experiments (not shown in the figures).
from Soup: 34 Figure 6 shows the pre-edge-background corrected and normalized to a step size of unity chlorine K-edge XANES spectra of three solid chlorine standards: NaCl (a, green), PtCl 2 (b, black) and H 2 PtCl 6 (c, red).

 ###### 
from test: 35 A nearly complete recovery of the FC performance at 0.6 V in our experiments was accomplished by repetitious exposure of the cathode to OCV in nitrogen following initial hydrogen treatment. Continuous recovery of FC performance was monitored by running polarization curves followed by holding at 0.6 V after each cooling procedure. Five polarization curves measured consecutively during recovery procedure are compared to the curve measured at BOT (solid circles) in Fig. 9. FC performance gradually recovers in the region of 0.5–0.7 V, approaching current densities that closely match those of the BOT curve. On the contrary, performance is never completely recovered at cell voltages more positive than 0.74 V and in particular in the kinetic region (i < 0.1 A cm−2). This is consistent with Pt ECSA loss measured from CV curves shown in Fig. 3b. Changes in the polarization curves in the kinetic region can be closely monitored when presented in Tafel coordinates (inset in Fig. 9). Polarization curves shift towards the BOT curve (black solid circles) with every successive recovery procedure, with decreasing increments in potential between consecutive curves. Eventually, the polarization curves approach a position (violet diamonds in the inset in Fig. 9) that is not affected by successive recovery steps, indicative of complete chloride removal from the fuel cell cathode.

 ###### 
from test: 36 Tafel analysis of the linear parts of the polarization curves shown in the inset in Fig. 9 gives the slope of 55 ± 3 mV that is not affected by the presence of adsorbed chloride ions, implying that the mechanism of the ORR is not affected by the adsorbed chloride ions.
from Soup: 36 Figure 7 show e x-situ XANES spectrum recorded for a Gore CCM from a FC exposed to 4 ppm HCl in air (a, black line) at 0.6 V compared to spectra of NaCl (b, green) and H 2 PtCl 6 (b, red) standards. A sharp peak at 2825 ± 0.2 eV is observed in the spectrum of the Gore CCM in the same region of photon energies as that of the H 2 PtCl 6 standard (red). The presence of this peak indicates that part of the platinum atoms on the surface of the nanoparticles is likely dissolved to stable [PtCl 6 ] 2− ions. This peak, however, becomes much less pronounced after the cathode H 2 -treatment (a, blue line in Fig. 7 ). It implies that the cathode H 2 -treatment after exposure to HCl in air results not only in desorption of chloride ions from the surface, but also in the reduction of the chloroplatinate ions. As a result, the absorption edge maximum at 2834.5 ± 0.2eV shifts by 2 eV towards NaCl standard, implying that chloride ions were generated during reduction of [PtCl 6 ] 2− ions. Even though these chloride ions are not adsorbed on the platinum surface (as they are not seen on CVs), they are likely present on the surface of Vulcan carbon or the Nafion ionomer.
 ###### 
from test: 37 A shift of the kinetic regions of polarization curves along the current axes during the recovery procedure is accompanied by a factor of three current increase (blue pentagons vs. blue diamonds in the inset in Fig. 9), implying significant impact of adsorbed chloride ions on the rate of the ORR. Interestingly, a factor of three decrease in current is accompanied only by 4% decrease in the Pt ECSA on respective CV curves (not shown in the figures). This is clear evidence of potential dependence of chloride adsorption, which is less pronounced in the hydrogen region on CVs (0.08–0.4 V) than in the ORR kinetic region (0.8–0.9 V).
from Soup: 37 To further explore the nature of the pre-edge peak on a XANES spectrum for CCM exposed to HCl in air at the FC cathode, a spectrum of a fresh Gore CCM soaked in 0.1M HCl solution for 2 h was measured (red line in Fig. 8a ). The striking feature of this graph is that, when normalized to a step size of unity, this spectrum becomes almost indistinguishable from the spectrum of the CCM exposed to HCl in air (black line in Fig. 8a ), meaning that the platinum atoms dissolve (corrode) in the presence of HCl solution in air.

Obviously, these trace chloride ions do not affect the shape of the XANES spectrum from the HCl-soaked CCM.
 ###### 
from test: 38 When the ORR is not complicated by chloride adsorption, a decrease in platinum ECSA due to chloride adsorption from the CV curves can be compared to the results calculated from the polarization curves, as the kinetic current is proportional to the number of platinum sites available for the ORR. For an iR-corrected fuel cell voltage of 0.85 V, the ratio of the currents from polarization curves is 0.63 (0.046 A cm−2 for violet diamonds vs. 0.073 A cm−2 for solid black circles), while 0.8 is obtained from the ratio of respective Pt ECSAs based on the hydrogen adsorption region on CVs (blue and black curves in Fig. 3a). The agreement within 20% between the results obtained by two techniques focused on two different potential regions seems reasonable, considering the experimental errors both in the surface area measurements and the analysis of polarization curves.
from Soup: 38 Why are platinum nanoparticles not stable in the presence of HCl solution? Dissolution of noble metals in the presence of ions that can form stable metal-ion complexes has been reported previously. 13 For example, gold dissolves in the presence of KCl and dissolved O 2 . 13 Metal dissolution in the presence of a ligand forming stable metal complex is usually assigned to the negative shifting in the equilibrium potential for metal dissolution (see Eqs. 1, 2 ). When the equilibrium potential for metal dissolution becomes more negative than that of the ORR (1.23 V at 25°C), 13 metal dissolution becomes possible in the oxygen-rich environment most likely according to the reaction in Eq. 3
 ###### 
from test: 39 Note, that chloride adsorption affects not only the kinetic region of the polarization curves, but also the region dominated by diffusion of molecular oxygen (0.5–0.7 V). The second polarization curve in Fig. 2 measured after H2-purge (open blue pentagons) reveals worse performance at 0.5–0.7 V compared to that of the first curve (solid blue pentagons). This implies that the chloride ions may affect water management at the cathode. One of the possible scenarios involves increasing the hydrophilicity of the GDL by adsorbed chloride ions leading to flooding at the cathode.2

 ###### 
from test: 40 An interesting feature of the series of the successive polarization curves shown in Fig. 9 is that performance is completely recovered in the region where the ORR is dominated by oxygen diffusion (0.5–0.7 V, blue diamonds), while it is not recovered in the kinetic region (0.8–0.9 V). The reason for such inconsistency may be the changing hydrophophilic/hydrophobic properties of the GDL/catalyst layer after chloride desorption from the cathode leading to improved water management. A careful investigation of the microstructure of the catalyst layer and GDL is necessary in order to understand the nature of these changes.
from Soup: 40 A nearly complete recovery of the FC performance at 0.6 V in our experiments was accomplished by repetitious exposure of the cathode to OCV in nitrogen following initial hydrogen treatment. Continuous recovery of FC performance was monitored by running polarization curves followed by holding at 0.6 V after each cooling procedure.

This is consistent with Pt ECSA loss measured from CV curves shown in Fig. 3b . Changes in the polarization curves in the kinetic region can be closely monitored when presented in Tafel coordinates (inset in Fig. 9 ). Polarization curves shift towards the BOT curve (black solid circles) with every successive recovery procedure, with decreasing increments in potential between consecutive curves. Eventually, the polarization curves approach a position (violet diamonds in the inset in Fig. 9 ) that is not affected by successive recovery steps, indicative of complete chloride removal from the fuel cell cathode.
 ###### 
from test: 41 The effect of 4 ppm HCl in air on the performance of a PEMFC was studied using a combination of FC tests, ex-situ chlorine K-edge XANES and HRTEM. The performance of the FC cathode is found to be affected by two types of chloride species – the chloride and the chloroplatinate ions. While chloride ions inhibit the ORR and likely affect wetting properties of the gas diffusion media, the chloroplatinate ions contribute to irreversible Pt ECSA loss. Matsuoka et al.7 suggested that chloride-induced Pt ECSA loss at the FC cathode is due to Pt dissolution followed by reduction of dissolved platinum ions by crossover hydrogen inside the proton exchange membrane. We found that enhanced particle growth at the cathode also contributes to the Pt ECSA loss. Accelerated Pt crystallite growth at the cathode regardless of HCl solution injection side has been recently confirmed by Li et al.5 We assume that the Pt particle growth in the presence of chloride ions occurs through platinum dissolution-redeposition (Ostwald ripening31–33), driven by a decrease in the surface energy of platinum nanoparticles. Ostwald ripening, however, can be easily confused with another mechanism of particle growth, namely the coarsening of platinum nanoparticles due to their migration on carbon support. To distinguish between the two mechanisms, two criteria are usually used: (1) potential dependence of particle growth and (2) the shape of the particle size distribution, with the Ostwald ripening being potential-dependent and characterized by a tail towards smaller particle size.34 We do observe a potential-dependent particle growth, as the rate of particle growth at the anode (Fig. 5d) is lower than at the cathode (Fig. 5c), which points out to the dissolution-redeposition mechanism even in the absence of chloride ions at the cathode. On the other hand, the particle size distribution for the cathode catalyst exposed to neat air (Fig. 5c) has a well pronounced tail on the larger particle side, suggesting that the particle growth mechanism is coarsening through migration. The latter mechanism (in the absence of chloride ions at the cathode) seems more likely, considering that no Pt dissolution was observed in phosphoric acid FCs at 0–0.8 V.35, 36 Wilson et al.37 suggested that the potential effect on particle growth in H2|air PEMFC is due to different hydration level for the anode vs. cathode. Our experimental results suggest that the mechanism of particle growth in the presence of chloride ions at the cathode may be different from that of the cathode exposed to neat air. The more symmetric shape of the particle size distribution for the cathode catalyst exposed to HCl in air (Fig. 5b) vs. that exposed to neat air (Fig. 5c) suggests more pronounced contribution of Ostwald ripening to particle growth in the presence of chloride ions. More detailed studies of Pt catalyst degradation are necessary in order to resolve the two mechanisms of platinum particle growth.
from Soup: 41 Tafel analysis of the linear parts of the polarization curves shown in the inset in Fig. 9 gives the slope of 55 ± 3 mV that is not affected by the presence of adsorbed chloride ions, implying that the mechanism of the ORR is not affected by the adsorbed chloride ions.
 ###### 
from test: 42 Similar to chloride ions, any other ions or molecules (CN−, NH3, etc.) that form stable complex ions with platinum are expected to cause enhanced particle growth by dissolution-redeposition mechanism.
from Soup: 42 A shift of the kinetic regions of polarization curves along the current axes during the recovery procedure is accompanied by a factor of three current increase (blue pentagons vs. blue diamonds in the inset in Fig. 9 ), implying significant impact of adsorbed chloride ions on the rate of the ORR. Interestingly, a factor of three decrease in current is accompanied only by 4% decrease in the Pt ECSA on respective CV curves (not shown in the figures). This is clear evidence of potential dependence of chloride adsorption, which is less pronounced in the hydrogen region on CVs (0.08–0.4 V) than in the ORR kinetic region (0.8–0.9 V).
 ###### 
from test: 43 We found that chloride ions desorbed from the platinum surface by molecular hydrogen may be re-adsorbed by platinum catalyst at cell voltages of 0.5–0.9 V. When desorbed from the platinum surface, chloride ions are retained by GDL or graphite flow channels.2 Exposure to low potentials has to be repeated several times in order to completely remove chloride ions from the cathode and recover FC performance.
from Soup: 43 When the ORR is not complicated by chloride adsorption, a decrease in platinum ECSA due to chloride adsorption from the CV curves can be compared to the results calculated from the polarization curves, as the kinetic current is proportional to the number of platinum sites available for the ORR. For an i R-corrected fuel cell voltage of 0.85 V, the ratio of the currents from polarization curves is 0.63 (0.046 A cm −2 for violet diamonds vs. 0.073 A cm −2 for solid black circles), while 0.8 is obtained from the ratio of respective Pt ECSAs based on the hydrogen adsorption region on CVs (blue and black curves in Fig. 3a ). The agreement within 20% between the results obtained by two techniques focused on two different potential regions seems reasonable, considering the experimental errors both in the surface area measurements and the analysis of polarization curves.

from test: 44 The slow rate of chloride removal from the FC environment was also reported by Steinbach et al.3 10 h of recovery by “thermal cycling” was required in their experiments to almost completely recover the FC performance.
from Soup: 44 Note, that chloride adsorption affects not only the kinetic region of the polarization curves, but also the region dominated by diffusion of molecular oxygen (0.5–0.7 V). The second polarization curve in Fig. 2 measured after H 2 -purge (open blue pentagons) reveals worse performance at 0.5–0.7 V compared to that of the first curve (solid blue pentagons). This implies that the chloride ions may affect water management at the cathode. One of the possible scenarios involves increasing the hydrophilicity of the GDL by adsorbed chloride ions leading to flooding at the cathode. 2

from test: 45 The results of the experiments reported above can be used to provide a rough estimation of the impact of a real-world marine environment on PEMFC performance, as the upper range of NaCl concentrations in marine air aerosol (0.8 nM l−1)38, 39 is ca. 2 orders of magnitude higher than the HCl concentration used in our experiments (4 ppm HCl in air or 0.18 μM l−1). To better simulate the marine environment, we are currently performing FC tests in the presence of NaCl aerosol in air. The results of this investigation will be reported in our next publication.
from Soup: 45 An interesting feature of the series of the successive polarization curves shown in Fig. 9 is that performance is completely recovered in the region where the ORR is dominated by oxygen diffusion (0.5–0.7 V, blue diamonds), while it is not recovered in the kinetic region (0.8–0.9 V). The reason for such inconsistency may be the changing hydrophophilic/hydrophobic properties of the GDL/catalyst layer after chloride desorption from the cathode leading to improved water management. A careful investigation of the microstructure of the catalyst layer and GDL is necessary in order to understand the nature of these changes.

from Soup: 46 The effect of 4 ppm HCl in air on the performance of a PEMFC was studied using a combination of FC tests, ex-situ chlorine K-edge XANES and HRTEM. The performance of the FC cathode is found to be affected by two types of chloride species – the chloride and the chloroplatinate ions. While chloride ions inhibit the ORR and likely affect wetting properties of the gas diffusion media, the chloroplatinate ions contribute to irreversible Pt ECSA loss. Matsuoka et al. 7 suggested that chloride-induced Pt ECSA loss at the FC cathode is due to Pt dissolution followed by reduction of dissolved platinum ions by crossover hydrogen inside the proton exchange membrane. We found that enhanced particle growth at the cathode also contributes to the Pt ECSA loss. Accelerated Pt crystallite growth at the cathode regardless of HCl solution injection side has been recently confirmed by Li et al. 5 We assume that the Pt particle growth in the presence of chloride ions occurs through platinum dissolution-redeposition (Ostwald ripening 31 – 33 ), driven by a decrease in the surface energy of platinum nanoparticles. Ostwald ripening, however, can be easily confused with another mechanism of particle growth, namely the coarsening of platinum nanoparticles due to their migration on carbon support. To distinguish between the two mechanisms, two criteria are usually used: (1) potential dependence of particle growth and (2) the shape of the particle size distribution, with the Ostwald ripening being potential-dependent and characterized by a tail towards smaller particle size. 34 We do observe a potential-dependent particle growth, as the rate of particle growth at the anode (Fig. 5d ) is lower than at the cathode (Fig. 5c ), which points out to the dissolution-redeposition mechanism even in the absence of chloride ions at the cathode. On the other hand, the particle size distribution for the cathode catalyst exposed to neat air (Fig. 5c ) has a well pronounced tail on the larger particle side, suggesting that the particle growth mechanism is coarsening through migration. The latter mechanism (in the absence of chloride ions at the cathode) seems more likely, considering that no Pt dissolution was observed in phosphoric acid FCs at 0–0.8 V. 35 , 36 Wilson et al. 37 suggested that the potential effect on particle growth in H 2 |air PEMFC is due to different hydration level for the anode vs. cathode. Our experimental results suggest that the mechanism of particle growth in the presence of chloride ions at the cathode may be different from that of the cathode exposed to neat air. The more symmetric shape of the particle size distribution for the cathode catalyst exposed to HCl in air (Fig. 5b ) vs. that exposed to neat air (Fig. 5c ) suggests more pronounced contribution of Ostwald ripening to particle growth in the presence of chloride ions. More detailed studies of Pt catalyst degradation are necessary in order to resolve the two mechanisms of platinum particle growth. Similar to chloride ions, any other ions or molecules (CN − , NH 3 , etc.) that form stable complex ions with platinum are expected to cause enhanced particle growth by dissolution-redeposition mechanism.

from test: 47 Sodium chloride is a major component of sea water and air mists that can significantly affect performance of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) used in a marine environment. The effect of sodium chloride solution on FC performance has previously been evaluated by several researchers1–3 and reviewed elsewhere.4 Sodium chloride introduced at the cathode of the PEMFC causes significant performance degradation1, 2 due to additive effects of sodium and chloride ions.1 Mikkola et al.2 observed the effect of sodium ions only in their experiments, possibly implying that, under certain conditions, chloride ions may be rejected by the proton exchange ionomer inside the structure of the catalyst layer. Sodium ions were found to decrease the proton conductivity of the cell due to replacement of protons by sodium ions in the Nafion ionomer,1, 2 while the presence of chloride ions led to a decrease in the platinum electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and inhibition of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).1–3, 5 Chloride ions have been shown to inhibit the ORR by reversible adsorption on platinum surface as studied at the electrode/solution interface.6
from Soup: 47 We found that chloride ions desorbed from the platinum surface by molecular hydrogen may be re-adsorbed by platinum catalyst at cell voltages of 0.5–0.9 V. When desorbed from the platinum surface, chloride ions are retained by GDL or graphite flow channels. 2 Exposure to low potentials has to be repeated several times in order to completely remove chloride ions from the cathode and recover FC performance.

from test: 48 Pt ECSA loss in FCs in the presence of chloride ions has been linked to platinum dissolution according to equations below7 where E0 and SHE stand for the standard electrode potential and standard hydrogen electrode, respectively.

from test: 49 Careful investigation of platinum electrodeposited films by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance confirmed platinum dissolution in 10 ppm aqueous chloride solutions at 1.06 V.8 In FC experiments, Matsuoka et al.7 found Pt deposited in the Nafion membrane after 50 h of FC testing in the presence of chloride ions in the air stream. Although the results of this experiment suggest platinum dissolution in the presence of chloride ions, no direct evidence of Pt dissolution in the FC environment according to Eqs. 1, 2 was provided.

from test: 50 Another negative effect of chloride ions may involve electrochemical generation of hydrogen peroxide which is detrimental to membrane/ionomer durability. Enhanced hydrogen peroxide generation in the presence of chloride ions was observed at the electrode/solution interface.6 The ORR on the Pt (100) surface (the most affected by the adsorption of chloride ions) occurred through a 3.5 e− reduction involving hydrogen peroxide formation in the solution phase. We have also observed inhibition of the ORR and peroxide generation from exposure to sulfur-containing contaminants in rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) studies.9

from test: 51 Here we resolve the mechanisms of the influence of chloride ions on FC degradation, and methods for performance recovery. To avoid complications caused by the presence of sodium ions, the chloride species were introduced in the form of gaseous HCl in air while the cell was held at a voltage of 0.6 V. This experimental approach is reminiscent of that used for studying cathode poisoning with sulfur species.8 FC experiments are complemented by ex-situ chlorine K-edge X-Ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in order to get information on the nature of adsorbed chloride species and morphology of platinum nanoparticles, respectively. Different aspects of chloride adsorption on Pt/C catalysts are discussed along with the recovery strategies, mandatory for keeping the fuel cell in operating condition after being exposed to chloride ions.
