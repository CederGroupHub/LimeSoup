from test: 0 The transient response of a series RC equivalent circuit to a staircase potential perturbation, where R represents the resistance due to the electrolyte and C a voltage dependent interfacial capacitance, has been examined theoretically using, as a model system, capacitance data believed to be characteristic of the Pt(111)|0.1M HClO4 interface. Solutions to the governing algebraic differential equation were obtained by numerical techniques, which were then used to generate current versus potential curves assuming various data sampling protocols.

from test: 1 The electrochemical systems of interest here can be represented by a resistor R, that accounts for the electrolyte resistance (see inset, Fig. 1), in series with a voltage dependent capacitor C, for which the differential capacitance would be given by dQ∕dVc , where Q is the charge stored in the capacitor and Vc is the applied potential across it. For the purpose of illustration, we have selected as a model system a Pt(111) electrode (0.05cm2) immersed in an aqueous 0.1M HClO4 solution, for which the characteristic linear scan voltammogram recorded at a scan rate ν=50mV∕s in the positive direction is shown in Fig. 1 (see left ordinate, bottom abscissa).11 It will be assumed in what follows that the voltammetric features associated with this interfacial system are strictly capacitive (or, equivalently, that the charge transfer resistances are exceedingly small and can thus be safely neglected).
from Soup: 1 Since its inception more than two decades ago, staircase voltammetry (SCV) has found wide application in a variety of fields, particularly in electroanalytical chemistry. 1 – 3 Indeed, much work has been devoted toward the development of theoretical foundations to extract compositional and/or kinetic data from this versatile technique. 4 – 6 As has been documented in the literature, however, situations do arise where the use of SCV can yield results quite different than those that would be obtained by conventional analog linear scan voltammetry (LSV). 7 , 8 The primary goal of this paper is to examine theoretically the electrical response of a series RC equivalent circuit incorporating a capacitor with a voltage dependent capacitance to a staircase voltage perturbation and compare it with LSV. Of particular relevance to this contribution is the work of Stojek and Osteryoung, 8 who described from a purely experimental viewpoint distortions in the voltammetric features of adsorbed redox active species, where solution phase diffusion plays virtually no role, as well as that of He. 7 In the present study, current transients were calculated by solving the governing differential equations using the well known purely capacitive voltammetric response of Pt(111) immersed in aqueous 0.1M HClO4 as a model system. As will be shown, extreme care must be exercised in the interpretation of data acquired with SCV for such strict capacitive processes such as hydrogen adsorption/desorption on Pt in aqueous electrolytes, for which mass transport can be safely neglected. This issue is of practical importance, as the actual areas of Pt electrodes are largely based on the integration of peaks associated with these interfacial reactions, and, therefore, any errors involved with their determination would lead to an inaccurate assessment of true specific electrocatalytic activities. 9 , 10 It should be stressed that many modern commercial potentiostats do not offer a true analog scan, implementing instead, internal, or in some cases, user controlled features, that allow for the current (or the total charge) to be sampled during and/or following each individual SCV step, or to be filtered to eliminate high frequency components. 7

For the purpose of illustration, we have selected as a model system a Pt(111) electrode (0.05cm2) immersed in an aqueous 0.1M HClO4 solution, for which the characteristic linear scan voltammogram recorded at a scan rate ν=50mV∕s in the positive direction is shown in Fig. 1 (see left ordinate, bottom abscissa). 11 It will be assumed in what follows that the voltammetric features associated with this interfacial system are strictly capacitive (or, equivalently, that the charge transfer resistances are exceedingly small and can thus be safely neglected).

It follows from Eq. 1 that if R is vanishingly small and Vext(t)=νt , i.e., a strict linear scan at a rate ν, as in conventional LSV as would be expected.

from test: 10 Plots of current vs potential, obtained for tsam=14T (curve a), 12T (curve b), 34T (curve c), and ca. T (curve d) over the entire range examined are shown in Fig. 4a. Cursory examination of these data reveals that none of the resulting curves provides an accurate measure of the true capacitive current, i.e., Cν , which would be recorded by applying an analog linear scan, shown as a thick line in this figure. In fact, within the hydrogen desorption region, the current for the shortest tsam , i.e., 14T , was higher, whereas for the other three, tsam was lower than the true voltammetric current. In contrast, all four sampled currents were lower in the purely double layer capacitive region. This may not be surprising as the real specific capacity in the latter potential range is much lower, ca. 0.03mF∕cm2 , than the corresponding value in the hydrogen adsorption/desorption region, i.e., 0.55mF∕cm2 , and, hence, for the same sampling time, the current measured would be smaller. Some aspects of this phenomenon, e.g., the virtual zero current in the double layer capacitance of Pt in acid media, have been noted in the technical literature provided by some manufacturers, albeit without a quantitative analysis. Somewhat surprisingly, no notable shifts in the position of the sharp peak could be discerned (see Fig. 5a). Similar results to those in Fig. 4a were obtained for another simulation involving Vsc(t) , with T=1.0ms , H=0.1mV , G=2ns , νave=100mV∕s , and R=20Ω (see Figs. 4b and 5b). Perhaps the most serious problem that would be encountered with SCV when the acquisition is performed for prescribed tsam relates to the determination of true electrode areas, such as those involving integration of voltammetric peaks. In fact, as shown in Table I, the areas evaluated from the current samplings, i.e., Qi , where i=14T , i=12T , 34T , and T, normalized by the area determined based on the cyclic voltammogram Q′ , decrease monotonically from 1.74 to 0.19.

In particular, the ratio obtained for the averaged current iave∕iCV , where iCV is the current measured via cyclic voltammetry, was very close to unity, i.e., 0.98. Some insight into these findings was obtained from the analysis of the response of a simple series RC circuit incorporating a capacitor with a voltage-independent capacitance for which solutions can be obtained in closed form (see the Appendix). As detailed thereinwhere H/T is the (average) scan rate. Also shown in the Appendix is the corresponding simulated analog linear scan voltammogram obtained at the same scan rate, for which the current I=vC{1−e−t∕RC} . It becomes evident from these results that the results of the two measurements at iave and I would be identical for the entire range of potentials involved. Furthermore, these two methods will yield the actual C after the time elapsed since the beginning of the scan exceeds the RC constant of the circuit. It is interesting to note (as pointed out by a reviewer) that numerical simulation packages of linear scan voltammetry available commercially use a staircase perturbation (often 5mV steps) to approximate the constant dV/dt associated with LSV and cyclic voltammetry (CV) simulations; and compute the current using Qstep∕T yielding excellent agreement with known exact LSV and CV solutions. In addition, some of these commercial simulators offer the option of intentional (as opposed to adventitious) simulation of SCV with options for different sampling protocols.

from test: 12 The third and last tactic implemented by one of the equipment manufacturers involves the use of a low-pass filter at the output of the cell to construct the response to a true linear scan from that to a staircase. As shown in Fig. 2a, the staircase (quantized) voltage waveform is an approximation to the linear voltage scan that is also shown. Each voltage step in the staircase waveform induces a current transient in the system response as shown in Fig. 2b. Over time, the forced response of the system includes both “high” frequency current response components induced by the sequential application of the voltage steps and a “low” frequency current response component induced by the linear voltage trend. Neglecting the voltage-dependent capacitance for a moment, the input–output dynamics of this electrochemical system is governed by a first order linear time-invariant differential equation with transfer function T(s); refer to the Appendix for analytical details. Letting V1(s) denote the Laplace transform of the staircase voltage waveform and I1(s) the Laplace transform of the output current waveform, then I1(s)=T(s)V1(s) . A linear low-pass filter with transfer function F(s) can be easily designed to recover the linear voltage scan v(t) with Laplace transform V(s) from the staircase voltage scan; that is, V(s)=F(s)V1(s) . If I(s)=T(s)V(s) denotes the “ideal” response of the system to a linear voltage scan, then I(s)=T(s)F(s)V1(s) . Because T(s) and F(s) commute, we have I(s)=F(s)T(s)V1(s)=F(s)I1(s) ; that is, the ideal linear scan voltage response can be recovered from the staircase voltage response by low-pass filtering, i.e., removing the high frequencies induced by the current transients in the response. This will not, in general, hold for a nonlinear system, e.g., an electrochemical system with a voltage-dependent capacitor. Shown in Fig. 6 is the current response of the circuit following application of the complete staircase where the amplitude of the current associated with each step is indeed very large. Not surprisingly, the Fourier transform of the signal (see Fig. 7) was found to yield a very large number of high frequency components. Removal of such components, or, equivalently, introducing a low-pass filter of 30Hz in this case, followed by an inverse Fourier transform, yielded a curve in excellent agreement with that of the system to a true linear scan except at the ends of the potential range (see Fig. 8). In other words, although the voltage-dependent capacitance induces a more complicated frequency spectrum than what would be obtained with a constant capacitance, it is still possible to separate the low and high frequency components and obtain a good approximation to the linear voltage scan response of the system.

from test: 21 Since its inception more than two decades ago, staircase voltammetry (SCV) has found wide application in a variety of fields, particularly in electroanalytical chemistry.1–3 Indeed, much work has been devoted toward the development of theoretical foundations to extract compositional and/or kinetic data from this versatile technique.4–6 As has been documented in the literature, however, situations do arise where the use of SCV can yield results quite different than those that would be obtained by conventional analog linear scan voltammetry (LSV).7, 8 The primary goal of this paper is to examine theoretically the electrical response of a series RC equivalent circuit incorporating a capacitor with a voltage dependent capacitance to a staircase voltage perturbation and compare it with LSV. Of particular relevance to this contribution is the work of Stojek and Osteryoung,8 who described from a purely experimental viewpoint distortions in the voltammetric features of adsorbed redox active species, where solution phase diffusion plays virtually no role, as well as that of He.7 In the present study, current transients were calculated by solving the governing differential equations using the well known purely capacitive voltammetric response of Pt(111) immersed in aqueous 0.1M HClO4 as a model system. As will be shown, extreme care must be exercised in the interpretation of data acquired with SCV for such strict capacitive processes such as hydrogen adsorption/desorption on Pt in aqueous electrolytes, for which mass transport can be safely neglected. This issue is of practical importance, as the actual areas of Pt electrodes are largely based on the integration of peaks associated with these interfacial reactions, and, therefore, any errors involved with their determination would lead to an inaccurate assessment of true specific electrocatalytic activities.9, 10 It should be stressed that many modern commercial potentiostats do not offer a true analog scan, implementing instead, internal, or in some cases, user controlled features, that allow for the current (or the total charge) to be sampled during and/or following each individual SCV step, or to be filtered to eliminate high frequency components.7
