from test: 0 Simultaneous transport of an electrolyte and dissolved oxygen is analyzed with Newman’s concentrated-solution theory to assess how nonuniform oxygen distributions might impact the voltages of metal/air batteries. For a solution comprising a neutral solvent, a simple salt, and oxygen, the Onsager–Stefan–Maxwell transport equations are inverted, yielding flux-explicit laws for oxygen, anion, and cation transport that distinguish the effects of individual diffusion and migration driving forces. Along with the ionic conductivity, electrolyte diffusivity, oxygen diffusivity, and cation transference number, a migration coefficient and a cross-diffusion coefficient are identified, which respectively account for the effects of electro-osmotic drag on oxygen and diffusional drag between salt and oxygen.

from test: 1 A standard liquid electrolyte for a metal/oxygen battery is made up of a neutral solvent, dissolved oxygen, and a salt with a single type of anion and a single type of cation. Given that four electrochemical species comprise these electrolytes, one expects on the basis of the Onsager mass-transport theory1 that six independent transport coefficients are needed to describe all the possible pairwise interactions associated with diffusion and migration. A recent paper by the author’s group2 applies the Onsager–Stefan–Maxwell formalism to lithium/oxygen batteries, but assumes two of the six transport properties are negligible. Most other state-of-the-art continuum models of metal/oxygen-battery electrolytes incorporate only four transport coefficients.3–7 We set out here to address this issue by proposing convenient flux laws that account for dissipative interactions between oxygen flow and ion flow.

A general implementation of Newman’s approach, which also shows how to identify and count independent macroscopic transport properties for multicomponent electrochemical systems, was recently presented by Monroe and Delacourt.9 That inversion procedure yields a ‘MacInnes equation’ (extended form of Ohm’s law8,10) expressing the current density i⃗ in terms of neutral-species activity gradients, as well as the gradient of a single ionic electrochemical potential μi that can be related to the potential of a reference electrode. The portion of the electrode-potential drop arising from spatial salt-activity differences is commonly called ‘diffusion potential’ (or ‘concentration overpotential’). Considering the complete set of proper mass-transport driving forces from irreversible thermodynamics suggests that diffusion potential might arise from differences in oxygen concentration, as well as from differences in salt concentration.

from test: 4 There is reason to believe that diffusion potentials from oxygen exist in some metal/oxygen batteries. For instance, experiments with aprotic Li/O2 cells typically require a preconditioning interval, in which the system is held at open circuit while being exposed to oxygen at fixed pressure until the cell voltage equilibrates.11–14 During preconditioning, which can last for hours,12–14 the open-circuit potential can vary across tens or hundreds of millivolts. It is likely that some part of this variation arises from a diffusion potential: since salt flux is negligible and the interfacial kinetics of oxygen absorption into the liquid electrolyte is probably fast, relaxation of the oxygen distribution within the cell could be the source of the slow voltage change. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that far shorter preconditioning is needed when Li/O2 cells are thinner.11

With these parameters one finds in the absence of oxygen that c 0 = 9.4 M and c T = 11.4 M, and that the volume fraction occupied by solvent is c0V¯0=0.98 . An assumption that saturation with oxygen negligibly affects liquid volume implies that V¯o→0 . These values confirm that c 0 and c e are both of the order of c T , whereas c o ≪ c T .

from Soup: 33 The assumption that c o ≪ c T simplifies the transport properties substantially. As one might expect, Equations 6 , 8 , and 9 show in the limit that the electrolyte diffusivity, cation transference number, and ionic conductivity match their values in the absence of oxygen, Interestingly, the oxygen diffusivity in this limit differs substantially from Do0 : Thus one straightforward way to evaluate the strength of the diffusional resistance that electrolyte and oxygen exert on each other, 1/Deo , would be to measure how much the apparent oxygen diffusivity reduces upon the addition of salt to the pure solvent.

from Soup: 35 Given the low saturated concentration of oxygen, it is reasonable to treat it as a thermodynamically ideal solute, so that f o = 1, implying that χ oe = 0 and χ oo = c T / c 0 . For simplicity we assume χ eo = 0 as well (i.e., salt activity is unaffected by oxygen content), which allows χ ee to be estimated from properties of oxygen-free electrolytes. Generally χ ee is of order unity; typical values are c0V¯0χee=0.68 for 2.24 M LiPF6 in a mixed-carbonate solvent and c0V¯0χee=3.1 for 0.85 M LiPF6 in propylene carbonate. 20 For the purposes of the present analysis we take χ ee = 5 (independent of composition), an atypically large value that should amplify the concentration overpotential contributed by salt gradients.

from Soup: 36 Finally, it is reasonable to assume that the variations in c 0 and c e are of similar order as the variations of c o during a preconditioning experiment. Thus oxygen transport can be thought of as inducing a first-order regular perturbation to the system that governs transport in oxygen’s absence, while the transport properties, thermodynamic factors, and partial molar volumes can be assumed constant and equal to their values in the limit c o → 0.

from Soup: 37 The transient cell response is governed by four species material balances of the form Under the justifiable assumption that the electrolyte maintains local electroneutrality, two of these balances can be replaced with equations that respectively express the local continuity of charge and volume, 21 Here v⃗□ represents the volume-average velocity of the liquid electrolyte, v⃗□=∑iV¯iN⃗i . The planar cell is held at open circuit during a preconditioning period, so the charge balance implies that current density vanishes uniformly, i⃗=0⃗ . Also, no species cross the anode during an open-circuit hold, so v⃗□ must vanish there, whence volume continuity implies v⃗□=0⃗ uniformly as well.

Oxygen therefore does obey a form of Fick’s law in the special case at hand, but only because the open-circuit condition removes any contribution that migration might make to the oxygen flux. Despite the null applied current, oxygen can still contribute to the diffusion potential; the MacInnes equation during preconditioning becomes in which the second term on the right may be substantially larger in magnitude than the first.

Through Equations 11 and 24 , this inequality places the upper bound on Xeo . The lower bound arises from inspection of Equation 24 , which shows that Deo leads to increased diffusional drag on oxygen by the electrolyte.

from Soup: 45 Integration of Equation 29 demonstrates that the potential drop across the separator during preconditioning follows The greatest potential drop occurs at t = 0. Experiments using lithium perchlorate in diglyme — an ethereal electrolyte similar to LiTFSI in dimethoxyethane — suggest that ΔΦ(0) is of the order of −100mV . 22 Inserting all of the property values listed in this section, and assuming the maximum possible value for Xeo , one finds that the Δ c e term in Equation 38 is more than three orders of magnitude smaller than the ΔΦ term. The potential drop can be explained by the Δ c o term if Ξ̃≈1.1×104 ; the corresponding migration coefficient is Ξ = 1.9. On the basis of this estimate, we hypothesize that the electro-osmotic effect could be significant in lithium/oxygen cells, and encourage its consideration in air-battery modeling and characterization. It is worth noting that the prefactor of the current density in Equation 14 is of the same order as those in Equations 15 and 16 . Thus the fluxes of oxygen, cations, and anions due to migration all appear to have similar magnitudes.
