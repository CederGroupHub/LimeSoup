from test: 0 The interaction of Pt with CeO2 layers was investigated using photoelectron spectroscopy. Pt-doped CeO2 layers 30 nm thick were deposited by radio-frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering using a composite CeO2–Pt target on a carbon diffusion layer of micropolymer membrane fuel cell covered by double-wall carbon nanotubes. The laboratory X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron radiation soft X-ray photoemission spectra showed the formation of cerium oxide with completely ionized species Pt2+,4+ embedded in the film. A small amount of Pt0 is present on the film surface only. Hydrogen/air fuel cell activity measurements normalized to the amount of used Pt revealed specific power up to 30 W/mg(Pt). The activity of this material is explained by high activity of embedded Pt2+,4+ cations toward H2 dissociation and formation of protonic hydrogen. Very high specific power and low cost together with planar deposition techniques make the material promising for microfabrication of fuel cells to power mobile systems.

from test: 1 Nonreactive radio-frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering was used to deposit CeO2 and Pt–CeO2 thin films on FC gas diffusion layer (GDL) and Si(100) wafer substrates. CeO2 sputtering was performed by using a 2 in. CeO2 target at a distance of 90 mm from the Si substrate with an rf power of 80 W, giving a growth rate of the cerium oxide films of 1 nm/min. The Pt–CeO2 thin films were deposited from the composite target prepared by placing pieces of 0.5 mm thick and 10 mm long Pt wire on the ceria target surface in the radial direction. Deposition was carried out at room temperature of the substrate in an Ar atmosphere by keeping the total pressure in the deposition chamber constant at 6×10−1Pa .
from Soup: 1 Pt–cerium oxide systems have been significantly active catalysts for CO oxidation, 1 hydrogen production, 2 oxidation of ethanol, 3 and decomposition of methanol. 4 The high activity for water gas shift reaction was predicated on the presence of cationic platinum 5 , 6 in cerium oxide. Ionic Pt dispersed on CeO2 crystallite surface by the combustion method formed active adsorption Pt2+,4+ sites which led to higher CO+NO and CO+O2 reaction rates. 7 , 8 Polymer membrane fuel cells (PMFCs) are future power production systems for clean and efficient generation of electricity from hydrogen and hydrocarbons. Platinum in pure form or alloyed with other elements is regarded as the only choice so far for high and stable performance. 9 , 10 As a consequence fabrication of fuel cells (FCs) would be expensive and wide production impossible. For this reason a substantial decrease in Pt loading and research of low cost anode materials with high activity is necessary. Pt–oxide anode materials such as Pt–RuO2 , 11 Pt–SnO2 , 12 or Pt–WO3 13 have been reported. However, the activity of these anodes for CH3OH oxidation is lower than that of the Pt–Ru alloy. Recently, the anode properties of Pt–CeO2 have been investigated for the development of a direct methanol FC. 14 – 17 The cyclic voltammetry showed that Pt–CeO2 quality as a direct methanol FC anode material might be superior to that of Pt–Ru/CB.

from test: 2 The photoemission spectroscopy was performed with X-rays of two energies to vary the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons and therefore the probing depth. We refer here to the lower energy as soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SX-PES). These measurements were performed in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber of the experimental system at the Materials Science Beamline at the Elettra synchrotron light source in Trieste (hν=180eV , ΔE=200meV ). Higher energy photoelectron spectra were measured using an Al X-ray source (hν=1486.6eV , ΔE=1eV ). We referred to these data simply as XPS results. All PES experiments were performed ex situ in UHV experimental chambers operating at base pressures of <10−10Pa . The SX-PES spectra were taken at normal emission, while XPS was measured at two photoelectron emission angles of 20 and 60° with respect to the surface normal to change surface sensitivity.
from Soup: 2 Ceria exists in two stable stoichiometries: CeO2 and Ce2O3 . The electronic structure of the CeO2 dioxide is characterized by unoccupied 4f states of Ce4+ while the Ce2O3 trioxide (Ce3+) has a 4f1 configuration. 18 Photoelectron spectroscopy is a powerful tool for investigating Ce 4f states. There are many spectroscopic data showing different 4f configurations using Ce 3d spectra. 19 – 22 Interaction of ceria with hydrogen leads to a higher concentration of Ce3+ ions due to surface reduction, 23 i.e., creation of oxygen vacancies. A kinetic model of ceria reduction 24 proposes that ceria is reduced at first through a surface step of hydrogen dissociation followed by a bulk diffusion step. The activity of surface steps is highly increased by the presence of transition metal on the surface. A density functional theory 25 shows that adsorption of molecular hydrogen on the ceria surface is energetically favored and depends on the surface structure. Adsorption of a H atom causes Ce4+/Ce3+ reduction in the nearest-neighbor single Ce ion. Pt ions incorporated in the CeO2 matrix mostly in +2 oxidation states enhance hydrogen molecule dissociation to protonic hydrogen and increase hydrogen storage capacity of the catalyst. 8 , 26 Similarly ionic platinum has been found to facilitate the H2+O2 reaction. 27

from test: 4 FC tests were performed by using a specially designed small FC device. The membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA) components were similar to those typically used in PMFC. The pretreatment of Nafion 0.09 mm membranes was performed by using a standard process of boiling in H2O2 solution, dilute H2SO4 and H2O .44 The cathode electrodes were made by carbon-supported Pt powder (Alfa Aesar, platinum, nominally 40% on carbon black) mixed with the Nafion solution [Alfa Aesar, perfluorosulfonic acid–PTFE copolymer, 5% w/w solution] and coated on the microporous GDL (Alfa Aesar, Toray carbon paper, teflonated, TGP-60). The loading of Pt in the cathode catalyst layer was 5mg/cm2 .
from Soup: 4 Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit high electrical conductivities and excellent corrosion resistances. The CNT-based FC electrode is suitable for the transfer of reactants in the catalyst layer, leading to improved FC reactions. A CNT-supported PtRu anode catalyst for direct methanol FC applications has been successfully tested, e.g., Ref. 34 , 35 . Pt coating of CNT in the form of supported nanoparticles was reported in Ref. 36 – 43 .
 ###### 
from test: 5 The anode GDL was spin coated by double-wall carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs, Aldrich) dispersed in water. The GDL/DWCNT was catalyzed by rf sputtering deposition of a Pt–CeO2 30 nm thin film. The reference FC anode was made by using the standard Pt–Ru powder catalysts (Alfa Aesar, Pt50, Ru50 atom %) mixed with Nafion solution and spread over the GDL surface with a loading of 5mg/cm2 . The pretreated Nafion membrane was sandwiched by the catalyzed anode and cathode by hotpressing to form a MEA of 1cm2 (10×10mm) . MEA was clamped between stainless steel gas distributors sealed with silicon rubber gaskets to seal gas leakage.
from Soup: 5 In this study we report simultaneous magnetron sputtering of platinum and cerium oxide which provides oxide layers continuously doped with Pt atoms during the growth. We show that Pt-doped cerium oxide films exhibit an unusual high concentration of cationic platinum Pt2+ and Pt4+ (nearly 100%) which opens the way for using such systems as highly active thin-film catalysts.

from test: 7 The Pt-doped rf-sputtered ceria films were deposited on DWCNT/GDL anode support. The layer thickness of 30 nm was determined by the SEM cross-sectional view of the reference film deposited on a Si wafer simultaneously. The SEM image of the reference film is presented in Fig. 1a. The polycrystalline character of the oxide deposit is well shown. AFM measurements reveal a very porous surface with a depth exceeding 30 nm and smallest crystallites below 10 nm diameter (Fig. 1b). The XRD pattern of the Pt-doped ceria film (not presented) shows only diffraction features which can be associated with CeO2 . The average ceria grain size determined by the Scherrer formula from the CeO2(220) pattern is 4.4 nm. Pt diffraction features are not visible, indicating a very small size or amorphous structure of Pt particles.

from test: 8 The 3d core-level XPS (1486 eV) spectrum of the CeO2 film deposited without adding Pt is presented in Fig. 2 (bottom curve). It consists of three 3d3/2-3d5/2 spin-orbit-split doublets characteristic of stoichiometric CeO2 (Ce4+) . The doublets represent different 4f configurations in the photoemission final state and arise from Ce 4f hybridization in both the initial and the final states.20 The appearance of a high f0 signal, together with an f2 peak which is less intense than the f1 peak, can be taken as evidence of the formation of CeO2 .19–21 In Fig. 2, upper spectrum, we show the XPS Ce 3d spectrum obtained for the cerium oxide film doped with Pt. The spectra are almost identical, showing that there is no measurable influence of added Pt on the cerium oxide stoichiometry.

 ###### 
from test: 9 The Pt 4f PES spectra obtained for the Pt-doped ceria film are plotted in Fig. 3. By taking spectra at different photon energies we changed the information depth of the analysis. For hν=180eV the kinetic energy of the Pt 4f photoelectrons is close to 110 eV corresponding to an inelastic mean free path in CeO2 of λ=0.5nm .45 In Fig. 3 the bottom Pt 4f spectrum was obtained by SX-PES at hν=180eV . The spectrum exhibits a main doublet at 72.85 eV corresponding to Pt2+ .6 The doublet shifted by 1.4 eV to a higher binding energy corresponds to Pt4+ . A small peak at 71.8 eV shows a Pt0 state. This energy is slightly higher than that expected for metallic platinum; this shift can be explained, however, by a size effect in PES, which is generally observed for very small particles (below 2 nm). The relative concentrations of different Pt species are presented in Table I. At hν=1486eV the relative intensity of Pt4+ increases while the Pt0 signal becomes practically negligible.

from test: 10 To change the surface sensitivity of XPS we measured the photoelectron emission for different angles of outgoing electrons relative to the surface normal. In Fig. 3 we compare spectra taken at 60 (λ=1nm) and 20° (λ=2nm) .45 Pt 4f XPS spectra obtained for photoelectron escape angles of 60 (higher surface sensitivity) and 20° (lower surface sensitivity) show Pt4+/Pt2+ ratios of 0.77 and 1.06, respectively, i.e., a substantial increase in the Pt4+ signal for lower surface sensitivity (see Table I). A simple estimation based on the enhancement of the Pt4+ signal as a function of λ leads to a structural model with a very low concentration of metallic platinum (3.5%) on the surface, Pt2+ -rich Pt–ceria interface and surface region, similar to the gold ceria interface in Ref. 46, 47, and Pt4+ dispersed in the ceria film bulk. The most probable picture of the Pt–CeO2 rf-sputtered films growth is that of the Pt4+ cations embedded in the growing film and of a very limited segregation of metallic platinum at the surface. The amount of surface Pt increases with increasing concentration of the Pt dopant (not shown).

from test: 11 Pt/Ce atomic concentration ratio Pt/Ce=0.05 was determined from XPS (20°) Ce 3d and Pt 4f peak areas by using the XPS atomic sensitivity factors. The Pt concentration determined in this way corresponded to an average Pt concentration in the surface layer probed by XPS, which is approximately 2 nm thick and could differ from that of the film bulk.

The loading of the PtRu catalyst in the anode was 5mg/cm2 . The polarization curves (current-voltage characteristics) of FC obtained at room temperature and hydrogen input flow rate of 30 mL/min are shown in Fig. 5 together with the power density (PD) characteristic. The peak PD attained for hydrogen/air operation was 196mWcm−2 corresponding to the maximum specific power (SPmax) (calculated as a ratio power/catalyst loading) of 0.04 W/mg of precious metal (PtRu). This performance corresponds to the typical one reported for hydrogen-operated PMFC catalyzed with standard PtRu and Pt/C catalysts.9

The left panel shows the detail of the catalyst deposit on the teflonized carbon surface of the GDL. Performance of the miniaturized PMFC prepared by catalyzing the anode GDL with the above-described rf-sputtered Pt–CeO2 catalyst is shown in Fig. 7. The performance test was obtained at identical conditions as the test of a standard FC in Fig. 5. The maximum PD obtained for this PMFC was 12.3mW/cm2 . The Pt content of the anode catalyst was 1.2×10−3mg/cm2 of MEA, calculated from the Pt–CeO2 film thickness (30 nm) and Pt concentration of 5.2 wt % determined by XPS and confirmed by quantitative energy-dispersive X-ray analysis in SEM. The maximum SP was SPmax=10W/mg(Pt) . A temperature-dependent performance test revealed an FC PD increase with temperature. At 40°C PD was 15.5mW/cm2 corresponding to SPmax=12.6W/mg(Pt) .

The DWCNTs dispersed in water were deposited by using a spin coating method. The SEM image of the DWCNT deposit exhibited GDL covered by agglomerated CNTs forming clusters of a few micrometers in diameter. Figure 8a shows the SEM detail of bare DWCNT deposited on GDL. Figure 8b represents a detailed view of a bunch of bare CNTs. In Fig. 8c bunches and single DWCNT covered with 30 nm thick sputtered Pt-doped ceria film are presented. Figure 8b and 8c is shown by using the same magnification. In Fig. 8d one can see a typical image of the anode catalyst. A frostlike character of the deposited Pt–ceria film shows a polycrystalline character of the oxide layer with a very small size of the oxide grains.

from test: 15 The performance of the PMFC with the DWCNT/Pt–CeO2 anode (shown in Fig. 8d) can be seen in Fig. 9. In this case we obtained an additional increase in PD giving maximum PD=43mW/cm2 . It corresponds to maximum SPmax=35W/mg(Pt) . The performance test was obtained at room temperature and hydrogen and air input flow rate of 30 mL/min, i.e., at the same conditions as for the reference FC, see Fig. 5. By comparing SPmax for the reference FC and the cell with CNT, we can see an increase in the performance nearly 1000 times. The PD is still five times lower than that of the reference FC, which shows that it is necessary to continue to search for a further increase in the anode performance.
from Soup: 15 The Pt 4f PES spectra obtained for the Pt-doped ceria film are plotted in Fig. 3 . By taking spectra at different photon energies we changed the information depth of the analysis.

from test: 16 There were several papers reporting on the use of pure sputtered platinum as an anode catalyst. Pt was sputtered on GDL and on the membrane. The results were rather contradictory, showing very low48 or comparable PD.49–51 To compare the activity of Pt–CeO2 and pure Pt sputtered we prepared both MEA, one with 10 nm of Pt on GDL and the other with 10 nm of Pt on Nafion membrane. We obtained PDs of 2.4 and 2.5mW/cm2 , respectively. It corresponded to SPmax of 0.12 and 0.13 W/mg(Pt). Thus in our case Pt–CeO2 revealed a higher activity than pure Pt.
from Soup: 16 To change the surface sensitivity of XPS we measured the photoelectron emission for different angles of outgoing electrons relative to the surface normal. In Fig. 3 we compare spectra taken at 60 (λ=1nm) and 20° (λ=2nm) . 45 Pt 4f XPS spectra obtained for photoelectron escape angles of 60 (higher surface sensitivity) and 20° (lower surface sensitivity) show Pt4+/Pt2+ ratios of 0.77 and 1.06, respectively, i.e., a substantial increase in the Pt4+ signal for lower surface sensitivity (see Table I ).

from test: 17 Pt-doped CeO2 polycrystalline film exhibits excellent properties as an anode material for hydrogen PMFC. Pt atoms embedded in the film bulk are completely ionized by forming Pt2+,4+ oxidic species. Cerium oxide has a Ce4+ character with a nonmeasurable concentration of Ce3+ species. Quantitative evaluation of low concentration of Ce3+ from the XPS data is not easy; however we suppose from the investigation of the Pt–CeO2(111) model catalyst by the resonance PES, which shows Ce3+ with high sensitivity, that Pt reduces cerium oxide at the Pt/CeO2 interface.
from Soup: 17 Pt/Ce atomic concentration ratio Pt/Ce=0.05 was determined from XPS (20°) Ce 3d and Pt 4f peak areas by using the XPS atomic sensitivity factors. The Pt concentration determined in this way corresponded to an average Pt concentration in the surface layer probed by XPS, which is approximately 2 nm thick and could differ from that of the film bulk.
 ###### 
from test: 18 A high activity of Pt-doped ceria films is given by Pt–ceria interaction. The tests of pure rf-sputtered ceria film deposited on GDL at identical sputtering conditions resulted in maximum PD=0.41mW/cm2 . High specific power of FC with Pt-doped CeO2 anode results probably from an enhancement of protonic hydrogen formation by Pt ions.26 There are probably two steps of the hydrogen interaction with the catalysts.

Quantitative evaluation of low concentration of Ce3+ from the XPS data is not easy; however we suppose from the investigation of the Pt–CeO2(111) model catalyst by the resonance PES, which shows Ce3+ with high sensitivity, that Pt reduces cerium oxide at the Pt/CeO2 interface.

from test: 24 The catalyst represents a very promising anode catalyst. Therefore further study showing the mechanism of hydrogen interaction, CO tolerance, temperature dependence of activity, and long-term stability is in progress.
from Soup: 24 A high activity of Pt-doped ceria films is given by Pt–ceria interaction. The tests of pure rf-sputtered ceria film deposited on GDL at identical sputtering conditions resulted in maximum PD=0.41mW/cm2 . High specific power of FC with Pt-doped CeO2 anode results probably from an enhancement of protonic hydrogen formation by Pt ions. 26 There are probably two steps of the hydrogen interaction with the catalysts.

This is due to an increase in the active surface of the anode and to excellent properties of CNT as FC electrode support. 35 – 43

from test: 27 Pt–cerium oxide systems have been significantly active catalysts for CO oxidation,1 hydrogen production,2 oxidation of ethanol,3 and decomposition of methanol.4 The high activity for water gas shift reaction was predicated on the presence of cationic platinum5, 6 in cerium oxide. Ionic Pt dispersed on CeO2 crystallite surface by the combustion method formed active adsorption Pt2+,4+ sites which led to higher CO+NO and CO+O2 reaction rates.7, 8 Polymer membrane fuel cells (PMFCs) are future power production systems for clean and efficient generation of electricity from hydrogen and hydrocarbons. Platinum in pure form or alloyed with other elements is regarded as the only choice so far for high and stable performance.9, 10 As a consequence fabrication of fuel cells (FCs) would be expensive and wide production impossible. For this reason a substantial decrease in Pt loading and research of low cost anode materials with high activity is necessary. Pt–oxide anode materials such as Pt–RuO2 ,11 Pt–SnO2 ,12 or Pt–WO3 13 have been reported. However, the activity of these anodes for CH3OH oxidation is lower than that of the Pt–Ru alloy. Recently, the anode properties of Pt–CeO2 have been investigated for the development of a direct methanol FC.14–17 The cyclic voltammetry showed that Pt–CeO2 quality as a direct methanol FC anode material might be superior to that of Pt–Ru/CB.
from Soup: 27 Cerium oxide layers were prepared by nonreactive rf sputtering. The layers were doped with platinum atoms during the growth. The layers exhibited a polycrystalline structure and revealed a high concentration of Pt2+ and Pt4+ ions. The PES spectra of Pt 4f show Pt4+ ions located inside the bulk of cerium oxide layers.

from test: 28 Ceria exists in two stable stoichiometries: CeO2 and Ce2O3 . The electronic structure of the CeO2 dioxide is characterized by unoccupied 4f states of Ce4+ while the Ce2O3 trioxide (Ce3+) has a 4f1 configuration.18 Photoelectron spectroscopy is a powerful tool for investigating Ce 4f states. There are many spectroscopic data showing different 4f configurations using Ce 3d spectra.19–22 Interaction of ceria with hydrogen leads to a higher concentration of Ce3+ ions due to surface reduction,23 i.e., creation of oxygen vacancies. A kinetic model of ceria reduction24 proposes that ceria is reduced at first through a surface step of hydrogen dissociation followed by a bulk diffusion step. The activity of surface steps is highly increased by the presence of transition metal on the surface. A density functional theory25 shows that adsorption of molecular hydrogen on the ceria surface is energetically favored and depends on the surface structure. Adsorption of a H atom causes Ce4+/Ce3+ reduction in the nearest-neighbor single Ce ion. Pt ions incorporated in the CeO2 matrix mostly in +2 oxidation states enhance hydrogen molecule dissociation to protonic hydrogen and increase hydrogen storage capacity of the catalyst.8, 26 Similarly ionic platinum has been found to facilitate the H2+O2 reaction.27
from Soup: 28 MEA made with the Pt–CeO2 anode catalyst deposited on GDL and on DWCNT-covered GDL revealed a high activity for hydrogen fed FC at room temperature. Particularly the Pt–CeO2/DWCNT/GDL anode revealed a PD=43mW/cm2 , which corresponded to a maximum specific power SPmax=35W/mg(Pt) .

from test: 29 There are several reports concerning the deposition of CeO2 films using sputtering, mainly for superconducting and microwave applications, e.g., Ref. 28–32. Recently we showed that cosputtering of cerium oxide with gold led to the formation of a thin-film catalyst with a high concentration of ionic gold in Au+,3+ states.33

from test: 30 Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit high electrical conductivities and excellent corrosion resistances. The CNT-based FC electrode is suitable for the transfer of reactants in the catalyst layer, leading to improved FC reactions. A CNT-supported PtRu anode catalyst for direct methanol FC applications has been successfully tested, e.g., Ref. 34, 35. Pt coating of CNT in the form of supported nanoparticles was reported in Ref. 36–43.

from test: 31 In this study we report simultaneous magnetron sputtering of platinum and cerium oxide which provides oxide layers continuously doped with Pt atoms during the growth. We show that Pt-doped cerium oxide films exhibit an unusual high concentration of cationic platinum Pt2+ and Pt4+ (nearly 100%) which opens the way for using such systems as highly active thin-film catalysts.
