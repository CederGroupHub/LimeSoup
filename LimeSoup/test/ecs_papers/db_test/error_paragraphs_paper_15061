from test: 0 A surface kinetic model is developed using a proposed mechanism for the anodic and cathodic branches of the hydrogen evolution observed over magnesium (i.e. the negative difference effect). The key element to the model is that hydrogen evolution requires the removal of adsorbed OH from the surface. This step is achieved in the cathodic branch by reductive desorption of OH to form OH− from the surface, and in the anodic branch by the dissolution of both adsorbed OH along with the Mg atom to which it is attached (thus combined desorption of OH− alongside dissolution of Mg2+). Steady state theory is applied to derive expressions for the hydrogen evolution rate as a function of potential. First-principles parameters obtained from the literature are used to compute the rate constants for the individual mechanistic steps, where available, and reasonable values based on cohesive energies are used to estimate the remaining parameters where first-principles information is not available. These rate constants are then applied to the surface kinetic model to show that the model provides reasonable agreement with the observed phenomenology for hydrogen evolution over magnesium, both in terms of the shape and order of magnitude of hydrogen evolved, and the transition potential (i.e. the open circuit potential) between the anodic and cathodic hydrogen evolution branches.

from test: 1 A characteristic of corroding magnesium surfaces is the production of hydrogen under both anodic and cathodic conditions. The evolution of hydrogen under anodic conditions is atypical, since hydrogen evolution is typically a cathodic phenomenon, and, accordingly it has been given the name “the negative difference effect”. This effect has been reviewed in the study of magnesium corrosion mechanisms by Song and Atrens1 and references therein. It is considered to be unusual because it is generally perceived that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) should be suppressed under anodic conditions, since the production of hydrogen is a reduction reaction (the alkaline form of the reaction is shown): and therefore the reaction rate should decrease according to the expression: where U0 is the reversible potential, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and β is the Tafel slope. kHER,0 is the reaction rate at the equilibrium potential. That is, an increasing (i.e. more anodic) potential U should (according to standard electrochemical theory) lead to an exponential decay in the rate of hydrogen evolution.

from test: 2 Comparing this prediction, based on standard electrochemical theory, with the data presented by Frankel, Samaniego and Birbilis (2013),2 among many others, indicates that hydrogen evolution appears to follow this behavior up to a point (i.e. typical cathodic Tafel kinetics), but then, after the open circuit potential is traversed, becomes evolved by some yet unidentified anodic mechanism. This behavior is exemplified by the careful plots of the current associated with hydrogen evolution versus potential as shown by Frankel, Samaniego and Birbilis reproduced here with permission in Figure 1.2

from test: 5 This non-standard electrochemical behavior of Mg corrosion was documented as early as 1953 by Petty, Davidson and Kleinberg4 and characterized primarily through a valence associated with Mg dissolution calculated by normalizing the net charge passed with the weight loss of between 1.38 and 1.66. This reduced net valence was rationalized by the dissolution of Mg as Mg+ ion, which was then hypothesized to react with water to form MgOH+ and H2, thus also accounting for the anodic evolution of hydrogen. This mechanism, however, has been in dispute (see for example work by Swiatowska et al. that reports a measured electrochemical stoichiometry of n = 25), since the Mg+ ion has never been directly characterized, and it seems unlikely to decouple the reaction sequence of Mg dissolution (which involves water complexation at the interface) to form Mg+ with the second step that generates H2. Further investigations by Samaniego, Hurley and Frankel repeating Petty's experiment, with the addition of in situ Raman spectroscopy, demonstrated that the Mg+ hypothesis was unsupported by Petty's original work.6

from test: 7 This mechanism has been used to support the behavior of the Mg reaction as a function of the H2 pressure in the experiments. This mechanism preserves some nature of this univalent dissolution of magnesium – through the desorption of a net single valent species MgOH+, that is Mg2+-OH− - and has some bearing on the mechanism proposed in the present paper. Based on the recent ability to model surfaces with quantum chemical simulation, however, the formation of adsorbed species such as H2+ ads seems unlikely- molecular hydrogen readily dissociates on metal surfaces and is unlikely to exist as an adsorbed form.8 Furthermore, hydrogen adsorbed on metal surfaces almost always has a partially negative charge.8

Presumably their geometric means, weighted by the valence of the Mg ion, would give the net valences for dissolving Mg observed by Petty.

The reactions is postulated to take place entirely in the electrochemical double layer, thus not disturbing the bulk pH and equilibrium between water and its ions.

 ###### 
from test: 12 Water molecules dissociate upon adsorption on magnesium metal surfaces to produce adsorbed atomic hydrogen and adsorbed hydroxyl radical. (See Figure 3.) The exact charge states of these adsorbed species are not well defined. Quantum mechanical calculations for adsorption states indicate some localized charge transfer from the metal atoms on which they are adsorbed to the adsorbed states, but overall the reaction is charge neutral (no oxidation or reduction).13 This is Reaction 7. The reaction, therefore, consumes two available metal sites Mg* and produces one surface site that has OH bound to it (Mg*OH) and one surface site with H bound to it (Mg*H).

from test: 14 If Reactions 7 and 8 were to continue, the surface would eventually be covered by Mg*OH, allowing for no more hydrogen evolution. (Figure 5). However, there will be some rate at which the hydroxyl is removed from the surface by reduction to hydroxide (Figure 6a), making available once more the metal site Mg*: It is during this step that the electron is consumed, making the total hydrogen evolution reaction through Equations 7–9 an electrochemical reduction reaction.

The intermediate step, R3, is the one in which the electron transfer occurs, and will become slower and slower as potentials move in the anodic direction, thus leading to overall Mg * OH poisoning of the HER at anodic potentials. However, this can only account for the cathodic branch of the hydrogen evolution observed in Figures 1 and 2 , so the proposed mechanism in Equations 7 – 9 cannot be the whole story. To explain the anodic branch, we now propose that one more process must be occurring:

from Soup: 15 Mg * OH sites on the surface can alternatively be removed through anodic dissolution of Mg ( Figure 6b ). We assume here that sites where OH is adsorbed are the most vulnerable to dissolution, given that there is already some partial charge transfer from the Mg to the OH moiety to which it is attached, and the formation of a Mg-OH bond will tend to weaken adjacent metal-metal bonds. 13 There are a number of possible representations for this anodic dissolution step; we choose here the simplest one, in which Mg 2+ is liberated, along with the OH − ion and the release of an electron (note that Mg 2+ dissolution is a 2-electron process- here we assume the second electron is transmitted through the desorption of OH − ): The final term, Mg * , indicates that removing the Mg * OH will leave a freshly exposed Mg * site (initially Mg(m) where (m) stands for metal) which is available for further reaction according to Equation 7 . Since dissolving surfaces will not be atomically smooth, but quite rough, we leave aside the details as to how the vacancy is dealt with, but rather, stick with the simplistic description for the sake of developing an analytical model (see further below). Also, the dissolution of Mg from sites that do not have OH adsorbed can occur in parallel with Reaction 11 and, as will be shown later on, does not have a mathematical effect on the details of the current model. This concept is essentially very similar to that proposed by D. Williams and R. Newman in a 2015 Faraday Discussion - “a fast-dissolving metal has more (albeit momentarily) bare metal sites which are the sites of hydrogen evolution” - although herein the detail is added that this route is necessary to overcome the otherwise difficulty of eliminating the adsorbed OH species that would prevent further reaction. 14

Of omission from the mechanistic account is the formation of magnesium hydroxide films (distinct from metallic magnesium surface covered by a full or partial monolayer of adsorbed OH, Mg * OH), suggested to also be relevant to hydrogen evolution by Salleh et al. 15 We assume that this pathway is slower than the dissolution and HER kinetics, although certainly a treatment that considers the role of hydroxide in more detail could be made in a future work- especially given that theoretical data for the interactions of water and hydrogen with Mg(OH) 2 surfaces are also being newly made available. 12 , 16 Some preliminary discussion of this point based on theoretical data points for water dissociation and the formation of OH vacancies through OH − dissolution from the Mg(OH) 2 surface will be made toward the end of this paper.

from Soup: 17 Proposing a mechanism as in Reactions 7 – 9 , 11 provides a qualitative rationale that might explain the negative difference effect, but some reasonable, quantitative model needs to be developed in order to see if the proposed mechanism is truly viable. To begin constructing the quantitative model we note that, under the proposed mechanism, the surface sites will consist of available Mg sites Mg * , hydroxylated sites Mg * OH, and hydrogenated sites Mg * H. The model in its current form only considers the actively dissolving part of the magnesium surface, and so does not consider those surfaces that have been passivated by thin films of Mg(OH) 2 . This neglect is not meant to assume that these surface films are not important, but that they have not yet been included in the current model, and, we are assuming implicitly that the passivation to form the Mg(OH) 2 film occurs at a time-scale much slower than the Reactions 7 – 9 , 11 . Another type of surface site not considered herein are those that may be occupied by anions, like chloride. The role of chloride in affecting surface properties will be treated in a separate publication which uses density functional theory calculations for adsorption energies of different species on Mg surfaces to construct a surface phase diagram for magnesium in aqueous media. 3 , 17 , 18

from Soup: 20 The sign of the exponential differs from k 3 to k 4 due to the switch from a cathodic elimination of OH to an anodic elimination of OH conjoint with Mg dissolution. Under standard conditions (i.e. concentrations of 1 M for OH − and Mg 2+ and at standard temperature and pressure), U 0 for k 3 will be −0.83 V NHE, the equilibrium potential for hydrogen evolution, and U 0 for k 4 will be −2.38 V NHE, the equilibrium potential for magnesium dissolution. 19 To simulate the effect of different pH and background Mg 2+ concentrations we can shift the potentials using the Nernst equation. Within the treatment that follows we use [Mg 2+ ] = 2×10 −5 M and pH 11 based on the solubility product of Mg(OH) 2 and typical pH resulting from magnesium dissolution. 20 We will assume a typical β value of 0.5, although, at some point, it should be feasible to determine β entirely from first-principles.

Thus, they contain the differential equations that control the evolution of θ M , θ H , and θ OH over time. For example, according to Equation 7 , θ M will decrease at twice the rate at which θ H and θ OH increase. However, the differential equations for these variables will be tightly coupled. The differential equations resulting from the simultaneous occurrence of Reactions 7 – 9 , 11 are:

from Soup: 22 Since the adsorbed surface species are intermediates to the hydrogen evolution reaction, as illustrated in Equation 10 , the steady state approximation can be applied- that is, that the rates of change captured in these three differential equations should, on average, go to zero. Here, again, it is appropriate to remember that corroding Mg surfaces are eventually protected by the formation of a Mg(OH) 2 film, however, this film is observed to form behind the evolving active corrosion front (see work by G. Williams), 21 hence we assume this is at a time scale several orders of magnitude away from the events captured in Reactions 7 – 9 , 11 . In fact, it seems likely that this film might form following the reaction sequence 7 – 9 , 11 , as a consequence of the re-precipitation of Mg(OH) 2 once a critical pH and magnesium concentration are reached in the near-surface environment.

In fact, it seems likely that this film might form following the reaction sequence 7–9,11, as a consequence of the re-precipitation of Mg(OH)2 once a critical pH and magnesium concentration are reached in the near-surface environment.
from Soup: 24 The variables α and γ are introduced for simplicity, and the somewhat complex form for the rate equation arises due to the necessity of solving a quadratic equation when the steady state approximation is applied to the differential equations. The variable α can be related to the relative rate of elimination of the Mg * OH sites relative to hydrogen recombination, and the variable γ can be related to the relative rates of hydrogen recombination compared to water dissociation.

from test: 25 When we apply the steady state assumption, it becomes possible to solve for the steady state coverages θM, θH, and θOH and hence the reaction rates K1–K3, Equations 13–15. The reaction rate K2 is the rate corresponding to hydrogen evolution reaction (i.e. the observable volumetric evolution rate shown in Figure 2). The algebraic expression for K2 resolves to:
from Soup: 25 Having now presented the basis for, and the results of, the derivation of the hydrogen evolution rate, K 2 , as a function of the fundamental rate constants k 1-4 , we will now use a first-principles approach to quantify the rate constants, and hence see if the proposed combination of mechanisms can account for the negative difference effect of hydrogen evolution on pure magnesium.

from Soup: 26 While it is not straightforward to estimate the rate constants, k 1 –k 4 , we can in fact make some reasonable guesses by applying the Arrhenius equation which resolves to the requirement of estimating a prefactor A and an activation energy E a : Reaction 7 is the dissociation of water over the magnesium surface.

from Soup: 28 Reaction 9 is the cathodic desorption of hydroxide. This reaction will be electrochemical in nature, and so the Arrhenius term should be coupled with the Tafel equation. The activation barrier for desorbing hydroxide can be estimated using some reasonable physical arguments. The initial state- adsorbed hydroxyl- is likely to have a semblance of the solvation shell, so we assume it has approximately 1/2 of the solvation energy in the initial state. During the transition to a completely solvated hydroxide ion, the hydroxyl must first desorb, which has an estimated energy of 5.0 eV. d The hydroxyl species must then receive an electron to become OH-; the energy associated with this is 3.7 eV, from experimentally determined electron affinity of OH. 25 At the equilibrium potential for hydrogen evolution this value should be modified to the value 3.7−4.44 = −0.74 eV, since the absolute potential of the hydrogen evolution reaction is 4.44 V. 26 The hydroxide ion then receives the rest of its solvation shell; half of the solvation enthalpy of OH- is 2.4 eV, using the enthalpies tabulated by Marcus. 27 Put altogether, this gives an estimated barrier to the cathodic desorption of OH of 1.9 eV. The standard prefactor of 1.0 × 10 13 is used here, and the Tafel equation with a β value of 0.5 applied.

from Soup: 29 The final reaction step considered in the scheme is the dissolution of the magnesium ion. We estimate the barrier using the cohesive energy of Mg, 1.51 eV. 28 Density functional theory studies of the dissolution pathway for a copper adatom on copper showed that the early stage of dissolution was associated with the breaking of the metal bonds, 29 and hence, the cohesive energy should serve as a reasonable estimate for the activation barrier. Alternative estimates and/or values derived from detailed studies made using density functional theory could be made in future work. The standard prefactor of 1.0 × 10 13 is used. The Tafel relation is combined with this equation, using a β value of 0.5, as discussed earlier in the derivation.

from Soup: 30 The rate of hydrogen evolution, K 2 ( Equation 14 ), can now be determined by using the rate constants estimated in the preceding section to determine the constants α and γ. α is a function of potential, and so we calculate α for potentials ranging between −2.8 and −1.2 V NHE. Consequently, we arrive at a HER that has two branches: a cathodic branch, and an anodic branch. see Figure 7 .

from Soup: 31 The model data plotted in Figure 7a has a strong resemblance in structure and a local minimum at similar potential to the experimental data shown in Figure 1 2 highlighted here in the side by side plot shown in Figure 7b . Since the pre-factor is estimated to within an order of magnitude in the rate constants, we only show the relative rate scaled to the asymptotic HER values. As seen, there is a difference in the absolute potential at which the current drops to a minimum, as well as some differences in the steepness of the curve. These differences could be due to a multitude of factors, some of which may include (a) errors in the assumed rate constants, (b) neglecting the effect of other species (chloride, for instance), (c) ignorance of any microstructure effects, such as microgalvanic coupling within the model developed herein, (d) neglect of solid-state (rather than adsorption only) films of MgO and Mg(OH) 2 as well as mixed oxy-hydroxides, and last but not least (e) faulty assumptions in the expressions used to derive the model of equations 7 – 9 , 11 .

from test: 32 The rate of hydrogen evolution, K2 (Equation 14), can now be determined by using the rate constants estimated in the preceding section to determine the constants α and γ. α is a function of potential, and so we calculate α for potentials ranging between −2.8 and −1.2 V NHE. Consequently, we arrive at a HER that has two branches: a cathodic branch, and an anodic branch. see Figure 7.
from Soup: 32 One key feature to note in Figure 7a is the plateau in the hydrogen evolution rate at the cathodic and anodic extremes plotted. This plateau is a consequence of the reaction limitation regarding the kinetics of water dissociation and hydrogen recombination. That is to say, when the potential is sufficiently negative, the OH no longer poisons the surface due to cathodic desorption of OH − , and so the reaction can proceed as fast as the surface can dissociate water, and/or as fast as the hydrogen atoms can recombine. At the positive potentials, the OH poisoning is remedied by the anodic desorption of MgOH + (or some other synergistic combination of Mg 2+ + OH − , the quantum chemical calculations have not yet made that clear) and hence the same scenario also applies. The graph is also symmetric because the two reactions (cathodic desorption of OH − and anodic desorption/dissolution of Mg-OH) are both one-electron steps and we have assumed the same Tafel constants in our model. That symmetry may break as further first-principles or well-resolved experimental data can be obtained. In reality, the precipitation or solid-state formation of Mg(OH) 2 films on the surface will significantly perturb the shape of these curves as anodic potentials are encountered; that is beyond the scope of this interpretive, analytical model. It should also be noted that the curves are scaled to these plateau values due to the difficulty in calculating pre-factors for rate constants using first-principles.

from Soup: 33 To highlight the importance of surface adsorption effects on controlling the reaction behavior, in Figure 8 are shown the relative surface coverages of free metal (θ M ), hydroxide (θ OH ) and hydrogen (θ H ) that can be extracted from the steady state analysis performed using the rate equations derived in this paper. The coverage is shown as a function of the electrochemical potential. It is seen that the hydroxide coverage reaches a maximum at the open circuit potential, and then decreases as anodic or cathodic polarization occurs. The free metal sites (θ M ) maintain around 15% coverage, except for in the vicinity of the OCP, and it can be presumed that the conventional 2-electron dissolution of Mg can proceed at these sites following the usual Butler-Volmer kinetics. It could be that a combination of this 2-electron dissolution from free metal sites alongside the 1-electron dissolution at the OH-adsorbed sites is responsible for the non-stoichiometric net valence for Mg reported by Petty et al., 4 and further advanced by Atrens. 34

from Soup: 35 Once again, the phenomenology between Figures 2 (from experimental data) and Figure 9 (the current model) is in considerably good agreement, indicative that the proposed model, grounded in the latest density functional theory studies of fundamental magnesium surface chemical properties, provides a potentially useful model for accounting for the negative difference effect.

As more details are provided through either theory or experimental characterization, the simplistic analytical model provided in this paper would need to give way to 3-dimensional simulations using techniques such as kinetic Monte Carlo that can take into account the evolving shape of the surface, improving the realism of the model, but at the same time taking away from the intuitive benefits the analytical model derived herein provides. 30 , 31

from Soup: 38 An additional area of concern is that the formation of hydroxide films is not taken into account in this model- rather, we assume that the hydroxide films take a longer time scale to form compared to the events that lead to the fast moving corrosion front in magnesium alloys. It might be the case that, even when the system is cathodically polarized, a nanoscale hydroxide film is present on the material, and, as shown recently, this hydroxide film might have considerable activity for HER. 15

from Soup: 39 There are some density functional theory studies for hydrogen recombination and water dissociation on magnesium oxide surfaces with and without defects that might provide some useful starting points for estimating rate constants. 16 , 33 Those estimated rate constants could then potentially be used in a surface reaction kinetic model that uses a model similar to that derived in this work to provide analogous predictions for the activity of a surface that has the Mg(OH) 2 structure, with defect sites providing the place of Mg * as potential hosts for H * and OH * obtained from water dissociation and serving as the catalytic points for hydrogen recombination. The mechanisms may be slightly different due to the alternative ways in which water, hydrogen and hydroxyl/hydroxide can interact with ideal, stepped and defective surfaces of the oxides and hydroxides. Example steps to add to the proposed mechanism include the formation of defects due to Mg 2+ or Mg(OH) + dissolution, and the healing of defects via interactions with water, possibly involving the concomitant H 2 evolution, see, for example Ref. 34 .

from Soup: 40 We can make already some rough estimates for how processes may be different for the hydroxide film by looking at theoretical calculations that have already been performed on Mg(OH) 2 and MgO surfaces. Water dissociation on Mg(OH) 2 has been shown to have a barrier of 27.6 kcal/mol (1.2 eV, similar to the value calculated by Dr. K. S. Williams for Mg(0001), as used in this work) and OH − dissolution of 43.2 kcal/mol (1.9 eV, essentially equal to the value used here for Mg surface). 16 The hydrogen recombination barrier on a defective MgO surface is 0.61 eV, 33 suggesting that the overall rate at which these processes occur might be faster on an oxidized surface. Using these rough numbers for oxidized surfaces gives outputs that are entirely analogous to those shown in Figures 7 and 9 .

from Soup: 41 The theory concerning the formation of Mg + as a precursor to Mg 2+ evolution 34 and its tentative placement on the traditional Pourbaix diagram 35 may have some fundamental origin in the proposed reaction step 11 , which we recount here: This reaction has the “appearance” of being a one-electron dissolution process, but, in reality, there is a second electron that we consider to have transferred to OH − during the dissolution event. One could also write a possible pathway for Mg dissolution as: which is effectively the same, but we consider the OH − to be a ligand that supports the dissolution of Mg (similarly to Bender et al. 10 and Casey et al. 7 ). This microkinetic reaction step could be occurring, and would give the “appearance” of a univalent Mg as an intermediate to Mg dissolution. Since it is conjectured that 2-electron electrochemical steps are less likely (and therefore kinetically much slower) than 1-electron steps, it is possible that the dissolution of Mg occurs in this way rather than as the direct 2-electron generation of Mg 2+ .

Using these rough numbers for oxidized surfaces gives outputs that are entirely analogous to those shown in Figures 7 and 9.
from Soup: 42 The model can also be adapted to include a second route for dissolution of Mg 2+ from the sites that do not have OH adsorbed. These are the free sites represented in the surface kinetic model as θ M . Including the rate of dissolution for Mg 2+ from these sites could be coupled into the kinetic model, in which case Mg 2+ dissolution will occur in parallel with the processes occurring here, but mediated according to the extent of relevant surface sites, see Figure 8 . Many of the macroscopic observations occurring in experimental tests will be a combination of the mechanisms occurring in this work, alongside features such as the precipitation of Mg(OH) 2 , and the formation of distinct anodic and cathodic sites on the surface, that cannot be well-represented in the simplified mathematical model of this work. However, incorporation of all these effects in a wider multiscale model could well be achieved in a well-coordinated and collaborative effort as future work. As suggested above, one route could be to use kinetic Monte Carlo. Another route could be to use cellular automata. 36

from Soup: 43 A reaction scheme has been presented whereby H 2 can be generated on Mg via Tafel recombination of hydrogens obtained by the chemical (i.e. not electrochemical) dissociation of water on Mg, and the “cathodic consumption” of electrons is attributed to the desorption of OH − . Under anodic potentials, this cathodic consumption is disallowed and so HER would otherwise stop due to OH poisoning of the surface. We propose that, in the case of Mg, the OH can be removed anodically through the dissolution of the Mg atom to which the OH is adsorbed – assuming that OH might be facilitating the dissolution, leading to a one-electron dissolution pathway. This effectively creates fresh surface whereby more water can react with Mg producing H and OH. Using first-principles data from density functional theory and reference tables to estimate rate constants, we show that the proposed pathway can account for both cathodic and anodic HER, and the theoretically predicted phenomenology is in remarkable agreement with the measured relations between HER and potential and HER and applied current density. While there are many theoretical questions that remain to be answered, it appears that the proposed model might reasonably hold the key to understand the negative difference effect on Mg.
