from test: 0 In chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process, the removal rate is affected by the actual contact conditions between the wafer and the polishing pad. Further, the free abrasives in the slurry attack the wafer at the regions of actual contact. The polishing pad is one of the most important consumable materials in CMP since the pad surface texture changes during wafer polishing and substantially influences the actual contact conditions. Therefore, methods for quantitative evaluation of the pad surface texture have been proposed by various research institutes. We have developed a novel method for the quantitative evaluation of the polishing pad surface texture; this method is based on contact image analysis using an image rotation prism. We have proposed the use of four effective evaluation parameters: the number of contact points, the contact ratio, the maximum value of the minimum spacing of the contact points, and the half-width of the peak of the spatial fast Fourier transform (FFT) of a contact image. We determine the changes in the polishing pad surface texture on the basis of the proposed evaluation parameters in serial batch polishing tests. In particular, we focus on the relationships between the proposed evaluation parameters and the removal rate, which changes with an increase in the number of batch polishing tests. The evaluation parameters are linearly correlated with the removal rate. Hence, the removal rate is improved not only with an increase of the number of contact points and the contact ratio but also with a decrease in the size of the cohesion regions and the spacing between the contact points.

from test: 1 Figure 1 shows a schematic of the proposed measurement method, which is based on contact image analysis using an image rotation prism. The image rotation prism is a type of optical glass; light incident on the one side of the prism is completely reflected from the bottom surface of the prism when this surface is not in contact with any other object. In contrast, when there are contact points on the bottom surface, light is diffusively reflected by them.11
from Soup: 1 Progress in science and technology depends substantially on innovations in the semiconductor industry. For example, silicon wafers used for semiconductor device fabrication should have highly flat surfaces, and because of the continuous downsizing of such devices, 1 nanometer-scale planarization becomes important. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) techniques.

from test: 2 In our method, pressure is applied in the upward direction from the polishing pad onto the image rotation prism, and the contact image between the pad and the bottom surface of the prism is recorded using a microscope/camera system. With this microscope, photographs of a 7.3 mm × 5.5 mm area can be recorded at a resolution of 1200 × 1600 pixels and a grayscale color depth of 16 bits. Images are obtained from three different locations under each measurement condition, and the evaluation parameters are extracted. The average value of the resulting distribution is then calculated.
from Soup: 2 Recently, it was found that the material removal rate in wafer polishing is affected by the actual contact conditions between the wafer and the polishing pad. 2 , 3 The actual contact conditions affect both the mix effects of chemical mechanical factors of the slurry and the viscoelastic deformation of the pad. Additionally, the free abrasives in the slurry attack the wafer at the regions of actual contact. 3 Therefore, it is important to identify the optimum contact conditions under which the slurry can effectively act on the wafer and the removal rate can be improved.
 ###### 
from test: 3 There are several reports on the evaluation of the pad surface texture and the actual contact conditions by contact image analysis, i.e., the contact image between the polishing pad and the optical glass. In one of the previous methods, the pad surface texture and contact conditions could not be evaluated with sufficient reliability because the contrast in the photographed image was low.12 In yet another method, in situ measurements were not possible because for such measurements, a chip cut from the pad had to be inserted into the measurement device.13 In contrast, with our method, in situ measurements can be performed on a high-contrast image on the basis of the principle of the image rotation prism. However, the disadvantage of our method is that the surface profile of the entire pad cannot be measured, even though the polishing characteristics are known to be affected by this profile.14
from Soup: 3 The polishing pad is one of the most important consumable materials used in CMP since its surface texture has a substantial influence on the actual contact conditions. 4 Therefore, it is extremely important to develop methods for the quantitative evaluation of the actual contact conditions between the wafer and the polishing pad and to examine the effects of these conditions on the CMP characteristics.

An important advantage of this method is that the pad surface texture can be determined in a nondestructive manner. The effects of the conditioning time and the mesh size of the conditioner grains on the pad surface texture have been discussed using the proposed evaluation parameters, in addition to the relationships between the conditioning variables, removal rate, and evaluation parameters.

from test: 5 Figure 2b shows a schematic of the pad-conditioning method. The upper platen used for the conditioning is not shown in this figure because it would obscure the conditioners and the carrier. Conditioning was performed with #80 mesh diamond conditioner grains. The pads were placed on the upper and lower platens. During conditioning, the upper and lower platens were rotated in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions, respectively, at the rate of 1/3 s−1. The carrier, which has three diamond conditioners, was rotated in the counterclockwise direction at the rate of 1/5 s−1, so that it moved in small circles with a radius of 50 mm. The diameter of the upper and lower platens was 1,000 mm, and the outer and inner diameters of the conditioner were 505 mm and 475 mm, respectively. The main conditioning variables are listed in Table I(a).
from Soup: 5 In practice, the pad surface texture changes when the pad is continuously used to polish several wafers. 9 Therefore, both the removal rate and the planarity of the polished wafer are reduced owing to the wear and glazing of the pad. 9 Thus, the polishing pad needs to be maintained in an effective form by appropriate conditioning. 4 , 10 In particular, stabilization of the pad surface is very important for achieving a high removal rate. Therefore, during serial batch polishing tests, it is important to monitor polishing-induced changes in the pad surface texture so that the duration of polishing the pad surface can be modified in order to achieve the desired surface texture.

In the polishing tests, the upper platen was rotated in the clockwise direction at the rate of 19/60 s−1, and the lower platen was rotated in the counterclockwise direction at the rate of 16/60 s−1. The polishing pressure was set at 10 kPa. The main polishing variables are listed in Table I(b).

from test: 11 The spacing of the contact points is the maximum value in the set of minimum spacings, and it is determined by calculating the minimum spacing of the contact points in the contact image. Figure 4 shows the manner in which the maximum value of the minimum spacing of the contact points is determined. When the coordinates of a contact point Pk are defined as (xk, yk), the spacing dk,n between Pk and Pn is given by eq. 1:
from Soup: 11 Figure 2b shows a schematic of the pad-conditioning method. The upper platen used for the conditioning is not shown in this figure because it would obscure the conditioners and the carrier. Conditioning was performed with #80 mesh diamond conditioner grains.

from test: 12 where k and n are integers from 1 to K, K is the number of contact points, and k ≠ n. The set of spacing dk between Pk and Pn based on Pk can be expressed as follows:

The polishing pressure was set at 10 kPa. The main polishing variables are listed in Table I(b) .
 ###### 
from test: 13 Therefore, the minimum spacing dkmin based on Pk can be expressed as dkmin = min(dk). Furthermore, the set of minimum spacings dmin based on all the contact points can be expressed as follows:
from Soup: 13 The experimental flow is as follows: placing the new pad on the platen → 1 st pad conditioning → measurement of the pad surface texture by the proposed method → 1 st batch polishing → measurement of the pad surface texture and removal rate → 2 nd batch polishing → measurement of the pad surface texture and removal rate → … → 9 th batch polishing → measurement of the pad surface texture and removal rate → 2 nd pad conditioning → measurement of the pad surface texture → 1R st batch polishing → measurement of the pad surface texture and removal rate.
 ###### 
from test: 14 As a result, the maximum value dmax among the minimum spacings of the contact points can be defined and evaluated as dmax = max(dmin).

from test: 15 The spatial FFT result corresponds to the half-width of the peak in the spatial FFT analysis spectrum of the contact image. It is well known that the peak width in the spatial FFT analysis spectrum depends on the size of the cohesion region in the image.15
from Soup: 15 The number of contact points is the number of local maximum points in the image color spectrum (regardless of the color value) in the 7.3 mm × 5.5 mm photographed area.
 ###### 
from test: 16 From Fig. 3a, it is evident that many small contact regions are formed immediately after the first conditioning. However, as shown in Figs. 3b–3e, the number of contact regions decreases with an increase in the number of serial batch polishing tests. In particular, polishing enlarges the size of the partial-contact regions, and this change is pronounced in the parts enclosed by the dotted circles in Figs. 3b–3f. On the other hand, as seen in Fig. 3f, after the second conditioning process, the number of contact regions increases and the size of these regions decreases.
from Soup: 16 The contact ratio is the ratio of the area of the contact regions to the photographed area.
 ###### 
from test: 17 Figure 5 shows the relationship between the number of serial batch polishing tests and the removal rate. The circles show the average removal rate for five wafers, and the upper/lower error bars show the maximum/minimum removal rate for five wafers. Immediately after the first conditioning, the removal rate was 0.39 μm/min, and this value decreased as the batch number increased, reaching 0.36 μm/min after nine serial batch polishing tests. Moreover, immediately after the second conditioning, the removal rate becomes much greater (0.42 μm/min) than that just before the second conditioning.
from Soup: 17 The spacing of the contact points is the maximum value in the set of minimum spacings, and it is determined by calculating the minimum spacing of the contact points in the contact image. Figure 4 shows the manner in which the maximum value of the minimum spacing of the contact points is determined. When the coordinates of a contact point P k are defined as ( x k , y k ), the spacing d k,n between P k and P n is given by eq. 1 : where k and n are integers from 1 to K , K is the number of contact points, and k ≠ n . The set of spacing d k between P k and P n based on P k can be expressed as follows: Therefore, the minimum spacing d k min based on P k can be expressed as d k min = min( d k ). Furthermore, the set of minimum spacings d min based on all the contact points can be expressed as follows: As a result, the maximum value d max among the minimum spacings of the contact points can be defined and evaluated as d max = max( d min ).
 ###### 
from test: 18 The removal rate in the 1Rst polishing test, which followed the second conditioning, was higher than that in the 1st polishing test, which followed the first conditioning. The changes in the removal rates in the 1st and 1Rst tests were affected by the waviness of the entire pad surface. As shown in the experimental flow, new pads were pasted on the platens. The removal rate is known to decrease when wavy pads are used.14 The pad surface generally becomes wavy immediately after the pad is pasted on the platen. Therefore, in this experiment, the removal rate in the 1st polishing test was slightly affected by the pad surface profile, even though the pad had just undergone conditioning (the first conditioning).

The circles show the average values of the parameters, and the upper/lower error bars show the maximum/minimum values of the parameters for three different locations. Figures 6a–6d show the number of contact points, contact ratio, spacing of the contact points, and spatial FFT of a contact image, respectively. The number of contact points and the contact ratio decreased slightly with an increase in the number of serial batch polishing tests. Further, immediately after the second conditioning, both these values became higher that those immediately before the second conditioning, and equal to those observed immediately after the first conditioning.
from Soup: 19 From Fig. 3a , it is evident that many small contact regions are formed immediately after the first conditioning.

In particular, polishing enlarges the size of the partial-contact regions, and this change is pronounced in the parts enclosed by the dotted circles in Figs. 3b – 3f . On the other hand, as seen in Fig. 3f , after the second conditioning process, the number of contact regions increases and the size of these regions decreases.

from test: 20 The spacing of the contact points increased slightly with the number of serial batch polishing tests. In addition, the spacing immediately after the second conditioning was dramatically lesser than that just before the second conditioning.

Moreover, immediately after the second conditioning, the removal rate becomes much greater (0.42 μm/min) than that just before the second conditioning.
 ###### 
from test: 21 The spatial FFT result of a contact image immediately after the first conditioning was 127 μm (Fig. 6d). This value linearly increased to 222 μm after the second batch polishing test and then remained almost constant. However, the spatial FFT result immediately after the second conditioning was much smaller than that just before the conditioning, i.e., the value decreased to 101 μm, which was similar to that immediately after the first conditioning. This trend was similar to the change in the contact images with an increase in the number of serial batch polishing tests, as shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, spatial FFT seems to be a quantitative method for evaluating the cohesion at the contact points.
from Soup: 21 The removal rate in the 1R st polishing test, which followed the second conditioning, was higher than that in the 1 st polishing test, which followed the first conditioning. The changes in the removal rates in the 1 st and 1R st tests were affected by the waviness of the entire pad surface. As shown in the experimental flow, new pads were pasted on the platens. The removal rate is known to decrease when wavy pads are used. 14 The pad surface generally becomes wavy immediately after the pad is pasted on the platen. Therefore, in this experiment, the removal rate in the 1 st polishing test was slightly affected by the pad surface profile, even though the pad had just undergone conditioning (the first conditioning).
 ###### 
from test: 22 Figures 7a and 7b show the correlation between the number of contact points and the removal rate and that between the contact ratio and the removal rate, respectively. The removal rate linearly increases with the number of contact points and the contact ratio. Excluding the 1Rst result, the correlation coefficients for the removal rate are extremely high: 0.914 for the number of contact points and 0.859 for the contact ratio.

from test: 24 Figure 7d shows the correlation between the spatial FFT of a contact image and the removal rate. Comparison of Fig. 7d with Figs. 3 and 6d reveals that the spatial FFT result can be used to evaluate the cohesion level at the contact regions. The removal rate is high when there is no cohesion at the contact regions. Therefore, the number of contact points, the contact ratio, the spacing of the contact points and the spatial FFT of a contact image are concluded to be very effective parameters for predicting the removal rate.

Therefore, spatial FFT seems to be a quantitative method for evaluating the cohesion at the contact points.
 ###### 
from test: 25 Considering the abovementioned results, the micro-roughness of the pad surface texture decreased with the progression of the serial batch polishing tests because of continuous relative sliding between the pad and the wafer under the influence of the polishing pressure. Moreover, area of contact between the pad and the wafer reduced, that is, the actual contact conditions deteriorated. As a result, the mix effects of chemical and mechanical factors of the slurry reduced, and the probability of contact between the wafer and the abrasives in the slurry decreased when the actual contact area become small with an increase in the number of serial batch polishing tests. Therefore, the removal rate decreased with an increase in the number of serial batch polishing tests.16 However, by including a conditioning process, the actual contact conditions between the wafer and the pad could be improved; thus, the maintenance characteristics of the slurry improved. As a result, the removal rate was greater than that before conditioning.

Comparison of Fig. 7d with Figs. 3 and 6d reveals that the spatial FFT result can be used to evaluate the cohesion level at the contact regions.
