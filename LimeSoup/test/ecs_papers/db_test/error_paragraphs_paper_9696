Generally, batteries are made of two porous electrodes with a separator in between. Either side of the separator may have some ribs which act as electrolyte reservoirs and provide more electrolyte for the electrodes. A general model of such a battery can be seen in Fig. 1. This model includes a current collector at the center of positive electrode (x=0 ), a porous positive electrode, electrolyte reservoirs (the rib space), separator, a porous negative electrode and a current collector at the center of the negative electrode (x=l ). As it was mentioned, the electrolyte reservoir may also exist in contact with the negative electrode depending on the design of the separator.

This is a normal behavior and is called the Thermal Rise (TR). However, in some cases, the temperature rises to very high levels at which the structure of the battery fails. This phenomenon is called Thermal–runaway (TRA). In some batteries (for instance lithium–base batteries), TRA leads to the battery exploding which makes the prevention of such failures of crucial importance.

The first term on the right hand side of Eq. 49 is the entropic heat and represents the major contribution to reversible heat generation. The second term is called Dufour energy flux and accounts for the thermal diffusion. In most cases, the Dufour energy flux can be neglected.
from Soup: 48 To calculate the reversible or entropic heat of each reaction, the entropy change due to the reaction should be calculated. For chemical reactions, this can be done by considering the entropy change of the reaction from the entropy of formation for different materials. However, in an electrochemical reaction, charged species exist for which the entropy of formation does not exist in thermodynamic tables. Moreover, in a half–cell reaction, the entropy of electron should also be considered as well as the charged ions. Lampinen and Fomino 33 have explained this problem in detail. They have defined a semi–absolute reference for calculating the entropy change of charged ions in a half–cell reaction. They have also showed that using a semi–absolute reference for calculation of the entropy change for charged particles will result in absolute entropy change if the entropy of electron is also taken into account. In the same reference, they have used the semi–absolute scale and calculated the entropy of an electron. To have a better understanding, this method is briefly explained here.

This scale, which is known as absolute entropy, states that the entropy of each pure substance is equal to zero at absolute zero temperature. For example The absolute entropy of substances at higher temperatures can be calculated using the heat integral, i.e. However, in calculating the entropy of a half–cell reaction, the main problem is the calculation of charged species which is not as simple as a pure substance. This entropy can be obtained using the entropy of formation. For example, for the following reaction the entropy of formation is The absolute entropy sa∘[H2(g)] and sa∘[Na(s)] are well known but the value of sa∘[H+(aq)] should be calculated. It should be noted that sa∘[H+(aq)]≠0 , but ΔS∘[H+(aq)]≡0 . Therefore, the absolute entropy of sodium can not be obtained unless sa∘[H+(aq)] is known. The values of absolute entropy which are given in thermodynamic tables are defined as follows This means that another zero is defined for the entropy, which is In this equation, the index which indicates the absolute scale is dropped. In other words since sa∘[H+(aq)]≠0 . This new defined value can be called semi–absolute entropy, as although it is absolute, its zero differs from the absolute scale.

from test: 50 Traditionally, the total generated heat of an electrochemical cell is calculated by considering the overall heat generation of the positive and negative electrodes. This method gives a bulk temperature for the overall cell and does not allow predicting the temperature distribution inside the electrodes. On the other hand, the temperature distribution inside a battery cell contributes to non–uniform entropy change, hence a non–uniform heat generation. Therefore, to accurately study the thermal behavior of a cell, it is necessary to calculate entropy distribution inside the electrochemical cell.

 ###### 
from test: 63 Heat convection to the surrounding.
from Soup: 63 Convection is one of the most important mechanisms of heat dissipation. When the battery case temperature exceeds the ambient temperature, the convection starts to dissipate the thermal energy. The amount of this dissipation can be obtained from the following formula in which h is the convection coefficient, A is the area of the case and Tcase and Tambient are the case and ambient temperature respectively. This equation shows that the convective heat dissipation is proportional to the temperature difference between the battery case and the ambient.
 ###### 
from test: 64 Radiation to the ambient.
from Soup: 64 The temperature of the case surface usually differs from the bulk temperature. This temperature can be found by solving the energy equation inside the battery case. Moreover, the Navier–Stokes equations should also be solved inside the head space since this space is filled with gaseous material. However, in most situations, the captured air at the head space is almost stagnant and the thickness of the battery case is very small. Therefore, one can use one–dimensional thermal convective and conductive resistance models for the head space and battery case, as shown in Fig. 6 . The value of these resistances can be obtained from the following equations in which h∞ is the convection heat coefficient of the gass, d is the thickness of the case and λ is the thermal conductivity of the battery case.
 ###### 
from test: 65 Dissipated heat by the exhaustion of gases.
from Soup: 65 As it can be seen from Fig. 6 , the middle cells have less dissipation which results in higher temperatures. Therefore, the assumption of a bulk temperature for the whole battery is not valid in all cases. Moreover, it should be noted that heat can also be transfered from one cell to its neighboring cell. To calculate the amount of this heat transfer, the same resistance model that was described above can be used. The amount of thermal resistance can also be calculated from Eq. 77 .
 ###### 
from test: 66 Therefore, the total heat dissipation can be calculated as
from Soup: 66 In batteries working at low temperatures, the effect of radiation can be neglected. But in high temperature batteries, radiation plays an important role and should be considered. The radiative heat transfer to the ambient can be calculated from the following equation in which σ and A are the Stephen–Boltzman constant and surface area respectively. This equation shows that the radiation dissipation is a nonlinear function and is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature.
 ###### 
from test: 67 Convection is one of the most important mechanisms of heat dissipation. When the battery case temperature exceeds the ambient temperature, the convection starts to dissipate the thermal energy. The amount of this dissipation can be obtained from the following formulain which h is the convection coefficient, A is the area of the case and Tcase and Tambient are the case and ambient temperature respectively. This equation shows that the convective heat dissipation is proportional to the temperature difference between the battery case and the ambient.
from Soup: 67 Exhausting gases from a battery cell remove the internal heat out of the cell and reduce the enthalpy of the system. This amount can be calculated from the following equation in which, m· and h are the mass flow rate and enthalpy of the gases respectively. This term increases when the exhausting gas flow rate increases and can be neglected in sealed batteries, since there is no mass flow out of the battery.
 ###### 
from test: 68 The temperature of the case surface usually differs from the bulk temperature. This temperature can be found by solving the energy equation inside the battery case. Moreover, the Navier–Stokes equations should also be solved inside the head space since this space is filled with gaseous material.

 ###### 
from test: 69 As it can be seen from Fig. 6, the middle cells have less dissipation which results in higher temperatures. Therefore, the assumption of a bulk temperature for the whole battery is not valid in all cases. Moreover, it should be noted that heat can also be transfered from one cell to its neighboring cell. To calculate the amount of this heat transfer, the same resistance model that was described above can be used. The amount of thermal resistance can also be calculated from Eq. 77.
from Soup: 69 One of the advantages of the present model is that the heat sources and sinks can be calculated separately in each electrode and the distributed temperature inside the battery can be obtained. To achieve this, the chemical and electrochemical reactions at electrode/electrolyte interface should be expressed as Eq. 1 . For each electrochemical reaction, the rate of generation of species should be obtained according to Eq. 2 . The heat sources should then be determined using Eq. 41 or alternatively from Eq. 47 . According to this equation, the heat source depends on the open circuit voltage. This value is related to the entropy change of the reaction according to Eq. 49 ; therefore for each reaction, the entropy change should be calculated. However, since in each half reaction the charged ions exist, the entropy of the electron should be taken into account. With this procedure, the distributed heat sources inside the battery (also considering the heat dissipations) can be found.

from test: 80 During the charge process, the temperature of a battery rises to a specific amount due to the heat of electrochemical reactions and Joule heating. This is a normal behavior and is called the Thermal Rise (TR). However, in some cases, the temperature rises to very high levels at which the structure of the battery fails. This phenomenon is called Thermal–runaway (TRA). In some batteries (for instance lithium–base batteries), TRA leads to the battery exploding which makes the prevention of such failures of crucial importance.
from test: 81 Normally, TRA occurs in batteries during charge, especially in high rate applications such as Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV). Since it is considered as one of the common failure modes, understanding its cause and its elimination is of great interest.
from test: 82 Traditionally, this phenomenon is studied by experimental tests.1–7 On the other hand, one can use the theoretical analysis by simulation of governing equations of battery dynamics which includes electrochemical equations together with balance of energy. Accurate modeling and simulation gives detailed analysis of various parameters involved in TRA, resulting in a good understanding of the issue.
from test: 83 The governing equations of battery dynamics have been developed and presented by many researchers, e.g. see Refs. 8–13 for modeling lithium based batteries,14–25 for lead–acid batteries and26, 27 for nickel–based batteries. In all these studies, the governing equations are given for a specific battery type and can not be applied to all electrochemical systems. On the other hand, Wang et al.28 and Gu et al.29–31 presented a general and complete mathematical model of batteries and fuel–cells. This model is transient, multi dimensional and fully coupled with the Navier–Stokes equations and also includes the effect of porosity and heat generation due to the electrochemical reactions. Later, Gu and Wang32 introduced the energy equation to their proposed model and obtained a thermal–electrochemical model which can be applied on any battery and fuel–cell systems.
from test: 84 Beside the mathematical modelings, numerous studies have been carried out on the simulation of thermal behavior in battery systems. For example, Lampinen and Fomino33 analyzed the free energy and entropy changes for half–cell reactions. Xu et al. ,34 worked on estimations of single electrode heats. Bernardi et al.35 introduced a general energy balance for battery systems. Rao and Newman36 investigated the heat generation rate and general energy balance for insertion battery systems.
from test: 85 The above literature review indicates that in order to predict TRA, there is a need for a specific formulation. The present study accomplishes this, by extending the ideas in the aforementioned studies, resulting in a general system of governing equations which is capable of modeling and simulating TRA. The basic governing equations are taken from Ref. 28 and the general energy balance35 is used to determine the general formulation of heat generation according to the electrochemical reactions and Joule heating. The generated heat of each electrode reaction is calculated using the method given by Refs. 34–36 along with the results of Ref. 33. Moreover, in the present study, the effect of heat dissipation is also included into the proposed model. As a consequence, the presented model is capable of simulating the transient spatial distribution of temperature inside the battery. In Part II, the model is applied to lead–acid batteries and the TRA of this type of battery is studied numerically.
