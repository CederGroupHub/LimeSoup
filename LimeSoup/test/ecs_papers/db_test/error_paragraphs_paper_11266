from test: 0 Cycle life is critically important in applications of rechargeable batteries, but lifetime prediction is mostly based on empirical trends, rather than mathematical models. In practical lithium-ion batteries, capacity fade occurs over thousands of cycles, limited by slow electrochemical processes, such as the formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in the negative electrode, which compete with reversible lithium intercalation. Focusing on SEI growth as the canonical degradation mechanism, we show that a simple single-particle model can accurately explain experimentally observed capacity fade in commercial cells with graphite anodes, and predict future fade based on limited accelerated aging data for short times and elevated temperatures. The theory is extended to porous electrodes, predicting that SEI growth is essentially homogeneous throughout the electrode, even at high rates. The lifetime distribution for a sample of batteries is found to be consistent with Gaussian statistics, as predicted by the single-particle model. We also extend the theory to rapidly degrading anodes, such as nanostructured silicon, which exhibit large expansion on ion intercalation. In such cases, large area changes during cycling promote SEI loss and faster SEI growth. Our simple models are able to accurately fit a variety of published experimental data for graphite and silicon anodes.

from test: 3 The most common and fundamental source of capacity fade in successful Li-ion batteries (which manage to resist degradation over hundreds of cycles) is the loss of lithium to the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), which typically forms at the negative electrode during recharging. Initially, SEI formation protects the electrode against solvent decomposition at large negative voltage, but over time it leads to a gradual capacity fade as the SEI layer thickens. A solid theoretical understanding of this phenomenon will assist the design of batteries, for example by enabling the quantitative interpretation of accelerated aging tests, where a battery is cycled at a high temperature to hasten the progress of capacity fade.15 For such purposes, a model should be as simple as it can be without neglecting important effects.

from test: 6 In general, SEI growth results from irreversible electrochemical decomposition of the electrolyte, which competes with the desired faradaic half-cell reaction at the electrode surface. In the case of Li-ion batteries, SEI is formed at the negative electrode because typical electrolytes are not stable at the operating potential of this electrode during charging. The product of this decomposition forms a solid layer on the surface of the active material. A huge variety of compounds has been observed in this layer,21,22 though we largely ignore this chemical diversity.

from test: 7 If SEI formation were sustained throughout battery operation, it would render Li-ion batteries unusable due to the continual loss of lithium. The reason that Li-ion batteries can operate is that the SEI does not conduct electrons, and is almost impenetrable to electrolyte molecules.21 Once an initial SEI layer has formed, the inability of electrolyte molecules to travel through the SEI to the active material surface, where they could react with lithium ions and electrons, suppresses further SEI growth.16 Intercalation is suppressed far less, because lithium ions can easily pass through the SEI through the exchange of ions between the solvent, SEI compounds and the lithium intercalated in the active material.21 Thus the battery is able to experience many charge-discharge cycles with little additional SEI buildup. Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram of the competing reactions.

from test: 9 Uniformity.- We assume that the amount of lithium in the SEI can be parameterized by a single variable s, the thickness of the SEI. This thickness is assumed to be independent of location within the negative electrode, meaning that the electrode is homogeneous and is thin enough in the direction of lithium propagation that significant concentration gradients do not form. This assumption is justified a posteriori below using a more sophisticated porous electrode model.

from test: 10 Negligible solid deformation.- All intercalation compounds experience local expansion (and in some cases, also anisotropic contraction9,23 due to lattice mismatch) on lithium insertion. If the lattice mismatch is not too large (<5% strain), as in graphite24,25 then the solid expands reversibly with a concomitant, small increase in the internal surface area. The area available for SEI growth is thus fluctuating, but for practical battery electrodes it is reasonable to assume a constant surface area as we do in our initial model. The SEI layer also experiences small enough strain that it is likely to remain uniformly adhered to the surface.

In particular, silicon is a very attractive high-energy-density anode material for Li-ion batteries, but lithium insertion causes isotropic volume expansion by a factor of four. 26 During expansion and contraction of the active particles, the area for SEI growth changes, and the SEI layer is placed under large cyclic stresses that can lead to delamination. It is straightforward to include these effects in our single particle model, but we postpone these considerations to the end of the paper, since they are not relevant for most practical cells.

At first glance, this assumption may seem shaky because it ignores any dependence of SEI formation rate on the state of charge of the electrode and even on the magnitude and direction of the intercalation current. However, the SEI formation rate should depend on these factors only through its dependence on potential, and open circuit potential is close to constant over a wide range of lithium concentration in graphite. 27 The local potential will not differ too much from the open circuit potential provided the battery is not cycled at an extremely high rate, so the potential at the graphite surface remains rather constant.

In equation 2 , k is a reaction rate constant, a fitting parameter in our model. D is the diffusivity through the SEI of the species that reacts with lithium to form SEI, while c is the concentration of this species in the bulk of the electrolyte. Since we do not know exactly which species is dominant in the continuing formation of SEI during cycling, we assume that c is 1 M, a typical concentration of anions. We have made several arbitrary assumptions in order to present D and k in useful units; their values should scale appropriately (e.g. with temperature) but will only be a vague guess at the correct values.

from Soup: 16 Two questions must be answered to assess the ability of this simple model to explain SEI formation: can it match experimental results, and if so, does it hide variation that may be important in some cases? We answer the first by attempting to explain experimental results using equation 4 , treating k and D as adjustable parameters. For example, we apply the model to the results of Liu et al. 28 Inferring the SEI thickness from the percentage capacity loss (assuming an average particle radius of approximately 5 μm), we find that the approximation of equation 4 is valid even after the first charge-discharge cycle. Using this equation we find D = 2 × 10 − 17 cm 2 /s at 15°C and D = 3 × 10 − 16 cm 2 /s at 60°C. Figure 2 compares experimental data with the single particle model, as well as with the porous electrode model described in the next section. In the cell cycled at 60°C, capacity loss between 707 and 757 cycles is much larger than is expected under the model. This demonstrates that some other loss mechanism is important in this instance. The most likely mechanism is the delamination of graphite from the current collector: figure 10 of Liu et al. 28 shows delamination for this cell.

from Soup: 24 An important advantage of the porous electrode model over the single particle model is that it can assess the degree of spatial variation in SEI formation. Results of the model demonstrate that in realistic battery operating conditions, SEI formation is very uniform. Only in extreme charging conditions, where the lithium concentration gradient in the electrolyte is large enough to cause substantial underutilization of the battery, do significant non-uniformities in SEI formation occur. Figure 5 compares SEI formation in an electrode of width 50 μm, which is uniform even for fast charging, with that in a 250 μm electrode, where fast charging causes a moderate degree of non-uniformity. This non-uniformity is dependent on strong depletion of the electrolyte during charging. Thus the single particle model, which ignores spatial non-uniformity, is valid in normal circumstances, but the variation of SEI through the electrode should be considered when a battery is operated in extreme conditions such as at ultra-high rate or with very thick electrodes.

from Soup: 25 The porous electrode model does not explicitly account for temperature, while the single particle model assumes that the battery remains at a constant temperature. Very fast charging is likely to lead to a non-uniform temperature increase. Since SEI formation is strongly temperature-dependent, this temperature change is likely to have a larger influence on the spatial uniformity of SEI than any of the factors included in the porous electrode model.

from Soup: 26 Since the single particle model, whose important parameter is the diffusivity of electrolyte molecules through the SEI, appears to completely explain the loss of capacity due to SEI formation, it is interesting to provide a theoretical model attempting to explain the temperature dependence of this diffusivity. The model of this work applied to the experimental data of Liu et al. 28 shows a clear temperature dependence of diffusivity. To quantify this dependence, we compared the single particle model with the experimental data of Smith et al., 29 which span many days at temperatures from 15°C to 60°C. The diffusivities calculated from these data were consistent with an Arrhenius dependence, with activation energy E = 0.52 eV. Figure 6 shows the prediction of the single particle model, with diffusivities (and reaction rate constants) fit to the Arrhenius description.

from Soup: 27 The observed temperature dependence enables the single particle model to be used to draw quantitative conclusions from accelerated aging experiments, where an increased temperature is used to hasten capacity fade. A simple application is to estimate battery life at room temperature from data taken at elevated temperatures. The most accurate way to do this is to measure the progress of capacity fade at different temperatures, and use the results to calculate D ( T ). As a test of this procedure, data from only the first 105 days at 30–60°C in the work of Smith et al. 29 were used to calculate D ( T ) and k ( T ), using equation 4 . Results for these times and temperatures were fit to an Arrhenius equation. The resulting values of D and k at 15°C were used to predict capacity fade for 400 days: results are shown in figure 7 . Though the agreement is not perfect, it is reasonable given that no data at the temperature or time of the predicted region were used in producing the prediction. In particular, simply assuming s=αt 16 , 17 (i.e. neglecting the second term in equation 4 ) and using an Arrhenius equation to find α( T ) is not as predictive: the best prediction using this method is shown by the dotted line in figure 7 .

from Soup: 29 A more sophisticated application of the single particle model would be to predict the total capacity fade of a battery subject to varying temperature. This information could be used to construct a protocol to optimize lifetime given a particular set of unavoidable temperature constraints. For example, is it possible to increase battery life by cycling it a small number of times at particularly high or low temperature, in order to produce an initial SEI with low electrolyte diffusivity? Answering this question will require experimental work to check whether the measured electrolyte diffusivity depends on the temperature history of the battery as well as the current temperature.

from Soup: 30 The above analysis has considered only one species from the electrolyte reacting to form SEI. Experimental work 22 has shown that many reactions can take place to form SEI, involving a wide range of solvent species, anions or impurities. A more complete model would consider multiple reacting species, each with a characteristic k and D . However, since experimental results very quickly reach the large time limit, we can model the process effectively simply by assuming that the D implied by experiment is given by D=∑iDi where i references the different species. The capacity fade will be dominated by the species with higher diffusivity through the SEI. This suggests that capacity fade can be reduced by constructing the cell in a way that avoids the presence of substances with high diffusivity in SEI, for instance small molecules.

At higher temperature, all diffusivities are higher, and the dominance of the most easily diffusing species will be lower. If the less diffusive species form a denser SEI, as seems likely from experimental observation of denser SEI toward the bottom of the layer, 21 this will result in lower diffusivity for the remainder of the aging process and hence slower continued SEI formation.

from Soup: 32 Another application of the single particle model is to understanding the statistics of battery lifetime. If the typical diffusivity of electrolyte through the SEI is D m and the battery is defined to fail when the SEI thickness reaches s 0 , the average battery life will be τ m = ρ s 2 0 /2 cmD m (we have neglected the second term in equation 4 ). Since a battery is made up of many, presumably identical, active particles i and the total SEI formation is proportional to ∑iDit , we expect the measured D to have a normal distribution, assuming the distribution of the true diffusivity D i meets the conditions of the central limit theorem. Thus the inverse of the lifetimes of a collection of batteries should be normally distributed; SEI formation as modeled here will not cause anomalously short battery lifetime.

from Soup: 33 This prediction can be compared with other predicted battery lifetime distributions, such as the Weibull distribution from the theory of extreme order statistics. 37 , 38 A Weibull distribution is expected when failure occurs in a ‘weakest link’ situation, where failure of a single element causes failure of the entire cell. Mathematically, it is the limiting distribution for the smallest outcome of a large set of independent identically distributed random variables which are bounded below, with a power law tail. 39 Additionally, a Weibull tail at short lifetime occurs in quasibrittle fracture when the system can be modeled as a bundle of fibers arranged both in series and in parallel. 40

from Soup: 34 In order to examine the experimental lifetime distribution, we converted the data in table 2 of Park et al. 37 to lifetime data by defining the lifetime to be the number of cycles taken to reach a relative capacity of 85.6%, the average capacity after 400 cycles.

A normal distribution of lifetimes, shown as a solid line in figure 9 , is consistent with the data.

from Soup: 35 Until now, we have focused on gradual capacity fade due to the formation of a stable SEI film, well adhered to an electrode internal surface of nearly constant area. This is the situation in practical Li-ion cells, but various emerging technologies, which offer certain benefits, such as high energy density, suffer from much faster capacity fade related to accelerated SEI formation. The canonical and most intensely studied example is silicon, which is a very attractive anode material for Li-ion batteries due to its theoretical high energy density of 4200 mAh/g, 41 but, as a result of its enormous volume expansion upon lithiation (>300%), degrades very rapidly. One mechanism is the loss of ohmic contacts due to mechanical deformation and fracture, but the dominant mechanism is the rapid, unstable growth of SEI. Many attempts have been made to engineer silicon nanostructures capable of accommodating the large volume expansion and stabilizing the SEI, 41 – 43 but no model has been developed to describe the capacity fade quantitatively, which would be necessary for the development and testing of practical cells. In this section, we extend our model to account for surface area changes and SEI delamination and apply it to published data for nanostructured silicon electrodes.

from Soup: 36 The single particle model assumes that the SEI is made up of a single layer growing smoothly from the surface of the active material. In a material that experiences a large volume change on lithiation, such as silicon, 26 this assumption is no longer valid. Instead, the expansion during lithiation produces fresh surface area, on which SEI can form without hindrance from an already-existing layer. As the material shrinks during delithiation, the SEI formed on the newly exposed surface will be forced into the existing layer or possibly detached from the active material. In either case, it is likely that a substantial fraction of the new area formed on the next cycle is once again freshly exposed. This leads to capacity fade at a much faster rate than would be expected from the model in which the SEI layer remains uniform and area changes are ignored.

from Soup: 37 The effect of the fresh surface area can be modeled simply by applying the result of the single particle model, equation 3 or 4 , to a single charge-discharge cycle, and finding the total capacity fade by adding that of each cycle. The total SEI thickness is where τ is the time spent during one cycle at a voltage where SEI forms: we assume that this is the total charge and discharge time. This simple model predicts that capacity fade is linear in time, which is precisely what is seen for full cells using silicon electrodes. 41 , 44 – 47 Furthermore, since t/τ is the number of cycles, the rate of increase of s per cycle should be linear in τ . Figure 10 shows experimental data from figure 4c of Ji et al., 44 which exhibit capacity fade of 4 mAh/g/cycle at C/15 and 2 mAh/g/cycle at C/4, consistent with this prediction. Assuming a characteristic particle size of 1 μm, this implies D = 4 × 10 − 15 cm 2 /s. This is two orders of magnitude higher than that found in the case of graphite, for which we offer two possible explanations. The first is that, even in the case of graphite, the new SEI formed each cycle may form primarily on the newly exposed area, though in this case the shape change is small enough that the SEI formed in the previous cycle is not fully lost. In this case, the smaller formation area means that the actual SEI thickness is higher than that calculated assuming the SEI forms evenly over the entire active surface, since capacity loss, which is measured, is proportional to SEI volume. This would mean that the true value of D is higher than that calculated under the assumptions of the simple model. The second possibility is that the expansion of silicon is large enough to disturb the structure of the SEI, even within a single cycle. Such a disturbance might increase SEI porosity and is likely to increase D .

from Soup: 38 It is vital that full cell, not half cell, aging data are used to assess the impact of SEI growth on capacity fade. SEI growth leads to capacity fade due to the consumption of lithium that would otherwise be available for cycling. If an electrode is cycled against a lithium foil electrode containing excess lithium, this loss will not be observed, potentially leading to an overestimate of battery life. Indeed, experimental results demonstrate a substantially shorter lifetime for a full cell than a half cell using a silicon electrode: figure 4 of Baranchugov et al. 46 shows this particularly clearly. Considering only half cell data could lead to a falsely optimistic assessment of the lifespan of a silicon anode.

from Soup: 39 Another situation in which SEI formation could progress faster than suggested by the single particle model is when SEI is lost from the layer, by delamination or dissolution in a form from which Li remains unavailable. Significant SEI removal is known to occur in silicon anodes, as confirmed by direct observation. 42 Assuming that this loss is not so great as to reduce the layer thickness to zero or almost zero, it can be modeled by including a loss term in the differential equation for SEI formation: where f is a general function characterizing the dependence of the SEI loss rate on SEI thickness. The rate of capacity loss remains and the dependence of J on s is unchanged. This alters the long time behavior of capacity. Assuming that f is an increasing function of s (strictly all that is necessary is that the right hand side of equation 10 is ultimately negative; in particular, a constant f is sufficient), s will eventually reach some maximum s m . Once this maximum SEI thickness is reached, the rate of capacity loss will be J(s m ) . The overall result is a capacity fade rate that is linear due to reaction limitation for a short time, before moving through a t 1/2 transition region to a second linear region with a lower rate. This behavior, which could be expected for a system where the charge-discharge process places a greater burden on the SEI layer than that in graphite but less than that in silicon, is represented in figure 11 . In such a situation, capacity fade could be reduced not only by decreasing J(s) , but also by decreasing f .

Moreover, computational results with a more complicated porous electrode model of capacity fade show that no significant spatial variations form at the cell level. The temperature dependence of the diffusivity of the limiting reacting species through SEI can be modeled using an Arrhenius dependence. This model can be used to model the degradation of rechargeable batteries in a variety of thermal conditions, to guide and interpret accelerated aging experiments, and to understand the statistics of battery lifetime.

from Soup: 42 Although we have focused on SEI formation in Li-ion batteries, some of our models and conclusions may have broader relevance to other battery technologies, not involving ion intercalation. It is important to emphasize that, although SEI growth leads to capacity fade, it also plays a crucial role in rechargeable battery engineering. The formation of a stable SEI layer protects the anode at large negative potentials and allows the design of high-voltage batteries operating outside the “voltage window” for electrochemical stability of the electrolyte. The same general principle enables the stable operation of lead-acid rechargeable batteries (>2 V), where the half-cell reactions at the lead anode and the lead oxide cathode both form amorphous lead sulfate films, which allow active ions to pass, while suppressing water electrolysis outside the voltage window of the sulfuric acid electrolyte (∼1 V). 48 In that case, capacity fade can also occur by irreversible reactions involving active species via lead sulfate crystallization (“sulfation”). 49 – 52 Although this capacity fade mechanism differs from SEI formation in Li-ion batteries in the microscopic details, the engineering consequences are the same (increased interfacial resistance and loss of active material), and it may be possible to apply and extend our models of capacity fade and lifetime prediction to this and other rechargeable battery systems.
