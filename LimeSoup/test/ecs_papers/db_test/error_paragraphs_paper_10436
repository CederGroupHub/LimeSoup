Among the cathode components, the binder plays an important role in improving cell performance, especially in regard to the cycle life. 1 – 4

from test: 2 The preparation of CMC-H
from Soup: 2 Recently, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has been extensively used in commercial lithium batteries due to its excellent properties. It does not get reduced at low potential (5 mV versus Li/Li + ) nor oxidized at high potential (5 V versus Li/Li + ) at room temperature. However, it has been reported that PVDF reacts with lithium metal and LiC 6 to form LiF 5 and –(–C=C–F)– species via an exothermic reaction that increases the risk for the onset of thermal runaway. Additionally, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), which is generally used as a solvent to dissolve PVDF, has the following shortcomings: (1) a high cost, (2) a high boiling point, and (3) it is not an environmentally friendly solvent. Therefore, research on aqueous binders has also been carried out. Aqueous binders have many advantages: they are low cost and environmentally friendly nature, and there is no requirement for strict control of the processing humidity. 6 Because of these advantages, water-soluble binders have already been studied for use in rechargeable Lithium batteries. 7 – 9

Pure CMC-H was obtained by filtering, washing with ethanol/water mixture (85:15 by volume) and drying (T = 105°C) of the products.

These materials have the advantages of being biodegradable, nontoxic, harmless and biocompatible. Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is a linear derivative of cellulose with carboxymethyl groups. The presence of these groups makes the CMC water-soluble.

These results were confirmed by Jernej Drofenik et al. 12 Chao et al. 13 reported that the electrochemical performance of negative electrodes for Lithium-ion batteries made with hollow spherical NiO particles improved depending on the CMC binder used. The authors obtained a discharge capacity of 547 mAh·g −1 , and only 157 mAh·g −1 was observed for electrodes made with a PVDF binder beyond 40 cycles. Furthermore, CMC had been successfully used as a binder with Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 14 and commercial SnO 2 nanoparticles. 15

After the reaction was complete, acetic acid was added to adjust pH of solution until pH = 7. Pure CMC-Li was obtained by filtering, washing with ethanol/water mixture (85:15 by volume) and drying (T = 105°C) the products.
from Soup: 5 Compared with other metal salts of CMC, the lithium salt of CMC (CMC-Li) does not introduce other metal ions, so an exchange reaction of lithium ions in an electrolysis solution will be suppressed during the charge and discharge processes. 16 Currently, only a few studies have tried to address the synthesis of CMC-Li and the issues that affect the mechanism. In this work, CMC-Lis of different degrees of substitution were prepared in two steps. We selected 9,10–anthraquinone (AQ) because of its excellent electrochemical reversibility 17 , 18 , as a cathode material and compared the effect of different binders (PVDF and CMC-Lis with different DS) on the electrochemical performance of the AQ electrodes. Finally, a preliminary study of the mechanism of CMC was proposed.

The slurries were uniformly spread on aluminum foil. The wet electrodes were heated at 100°C in a vacuum to remove the water or organic solvent. Lithium metal foil was used as the counter electrode. A solution of a 1.0 M LiPF6 in EC/DEC (1:1 by volume) was employed as the electrolyte and spread over a double layer of microporous propylene separators (Celgard 2400).

The morphology of CMC-Lis were characterized by SEM performed with a Japan FEI HITACHI 4800 microscope operated at 20 kV. Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed to evaluate the electrochemical capacity and cycle life of electrodes at room temperature using a China LAND-BTI-10 instrument. The cutoff potentials for charge and discharge were set at 3.5 and 1.5 V vs. Li+/Li, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) (scan rate: 0.5 mV.s−1) and impedance response (frequency range: 0.01∼20000 Hz) were measured using a Britain Solartron 1280Z electrochemical workstation.

Both the CMC-Li and the CMC-Na spectrum show the presence of similar group peaks, the CMC-Li and the CMC-Na spectrum show the presence of –OH stretching at 3423.49 cm−1. The peaks at 1602.37 cm−1 and 1424.22 cm−1 correspond to the extra-vibrational bond of the carboxylic functional group and the peak at 2922.34 cm−1 belongs to the C–H groups of cellulose. The FTIR analysis also shows the presence of C–H stretching of the methyl groups attached to the carboxylic group at 1328.96 cm−1. The band at 1058.96 cm−1 is attributed to the ether groups of cellulose.19 The CMC-H spectrum is significantly different from the CMC-Na and CMC-Li spectrums, which indicates that the molecular structure of CMC-H changed significantly. For the –COOH group of CMC-H, there is a absorption peak at 1700cm−1, when –COOH group of CMC-H transforms to –COONa (or –COOLi) group of CMC-Na (or CMC-Li), the absorption peak at 1750 cm−1 disappears, and the two absorption peaks appear at 1600 cm−1 and 1400 cm−1, respectively. So we can infer that –COONa or –COOLi group is generated by the position of peaks.

Fig. 4 shows the EDS images of CMC-H (a) and CMC-Li (b). The levels of carbon and oxygen are measured in Fig. 4a. Hydrogen, being the lightest of all elements, was undetectable. These results indicate that in the process of acidification, the sodium was completely replaced by hydrogen. There is no residual sodium in the CMC-H. It can be seen in Fig. 4b that the CMC-Li sample does not contain any sodium either.

from test: 15 Fig. 5 shows the scans of thermal stability of different binders measured by TGA. PVDF shows an onset temperature of approximately 450°C, a rapid decomposition associated with a weight loss of approximately 70 wt% at 500°C and another weight loss of approximately 30 wt% at 600°C. CMC-Li-1 and CMC-Li-2 show exactly the same decomposition pattern up to 300°C, with a weight loss of approximately 70 wt% and an additional 10 wt% loss at 400°C. At this temperature a naturally occurring decomposition residue was generated. Thus, the use of CMC-Li has the advantage of being easily decomposed at the end of its battery life. Once the electrode is extracted, the active electrode material can be easily recovered by pyrolysis of the binder. As mentioned by Chao et al.,13 it is not easy to dispose of PVDF at the end of battery life. TGA showed that the binders are stable in the temperature range used for the preparation and drying of the electrodes.

from test: 16 In order to compare the electric conductivity performance between different binder samples, the summary of the electrical resistivity for different binder samples was listed in Table I. It can be seen that the commercial PVDF binder shows significantly higher electrical resistivity compared to the CMC-Li binders. That is, the electronic conductivity of the CMC-Li binder is superior to that of the PVDF binder. Table I also shows that the electrical resistivity performance of the CMC-Li-1 binder is not as good as that of the CMC-Li-2 binder.

 ###### 
from test: 17 The CV curves of AQ electrodes prepared using the three different binders are illustrated in Fig. 6. As expected, the oxidation and reduction reaction peaks of different electrodes appear at different potentials. According to the CV curves of the first two cycles, the use of the CMC-Li binder shows a smaller distance between the oxidation reaction peak and the reduction reaction peak compared to the PVDF binder. In addition, the CV curves of AQ electrodes prepared using the CMC-Li binder are sharper than those prepared using the PVDF binder, which indicates a smaller degree of polarization. Because the AQ particles are coated with an organic layer made mostly of the binder, it is expected that the nature of the binder will enhance the electrode/electrolyte interface. The binder adds a physical barrier to lithium diffusion that makes the lithium-ion movement process more difficult than it would be with just a bare binder. Compared with PVDF, CMC-Li is more ionically conductive.10 The particles of an electrode using the CMC-Li binder are coated with an effective ionic-conductivity layer that does not hinder the electrical and mass transport of lithium-ion toward and away from active particles. However, compared to PVDF and CMC-Li with DS (0.62), it can be seen that the degree of polarization of CMC-Li with DS (1.0) increases with cycles, we think that the viscosity is smaller, the adhesive property between active materials and current collectors becomes worse, which results in increasing the resistance of electrode. In addition, after second cycles, the two pair redox peaks appeared in the CV, which are in line with the discharge and charge mechanism of AQ.17–22

from test: 18 Fig. 7 displays the discharge and charge curves of AQ electrodes prepared using the three different binders. At a current density of 0.2 mA.cm−2, the first discharge capacity of a PVDF/AQ electrode is 197 mAh·g−1, while the first discharge capacity of a CMC-Li-2/AQ electrode is 223 mAh·g−1 and that of a CMC-Li-1/AQ electrode is 214 mAh·g−1 (cal. according to the amount of AQ). These results indicate a higher utilization ratio of active materials for the composite. As can be seen in Fig. 7, the distance between the discharge and charge curves of CMC-Li/AQ is smaller than that of PVDF/AQ, which shows that the polarization of the former is weaker than the latter, the result is consistent with the CV tests (Fig. 6).
from Soup: 18 Fig. 5 shows the scans of thermal stability of different binders measured by TGA. PVDF shows an onset temperature of approximately 450°C, a rapid decomposition associated with a weight loss of approximately 70 wt% at 500°C and another weight loss of approximately 30 wt% at 600°C.

from test: 19 The cycle performance of AQ electrodes prepared using the three different binders is shown in Fig. 8. Zhao23 and Song24 have reported that PVDF/AQ electrode as a cathode of lithium battery had a bad cycling stability. Generally, the cycle performance of a CMC-Li/AQ electrode is much better than that of a PVDF/AQ electrode. Fig. 8 also shows that the capacity decay of both the CMC-Li and PVDF electrodes is severe for the first 10 cycles, while the capacity decay of the CMC-Li/AQ electrode is slow and less serious than the PVDF/AQ electrode after 10 cycles. After 50 cycles, the specific capacity of the CMC-Li-1/AQ electrode is maintained at 62 mAh·g−1, which is much higher than for the PVDF/AQ electrode (33 mAh·g−1). These results confirm that the binder has an important effect on the cycling stability.3,11, Before 15th cycles, the capacity fades in the following order: CMC-Li-2>PVDF>CMC-Li-1, when considering the cycle stability, after 15th cycles, the order of performance of the half-cells made using the different binders is CMC-Li-1>CMC-Li-2>PVDF. Although the initial discharge capacity of the CMC-Li-2/AQ electrode is higher than the CMC-Li-1/AQ electrode, the capacity decay of the CMC-Li-2/AQ electrode is more serious than for the CMC-Li-1/AQ electrode. After 50 cycles, a lower specific capacity is obtained for the CMC-Li-2/AQ electrode.

It can be seen that the commercial PVDF binder shows significantly higher electrical resistivity compared to the CMC-Li binders.

Table I also shows that the electrical resistivity performance of the CMC-Li-1 binder is not as good as that of the CMC-Li-2 binder.
 ###### 
from test: 20 Fig. 9 shows the impedance response of AQ electrodes prepared using the three different binders. Generally, the high frequency semicircle is attributed to the Li+ charge-transfer impedance at the electrode/electrolyte interface. As Fig. 9 clearly shows, the diameters of the semicircles in the high-frequency electrodes with CMC-Li binders are smaller than for the electrode with a PVDF binder, which indicates that the charge-transfer resistance of a cell with a CMC-Li/AQ electrode is much lower than for a cell made from a PVDF/AQ electrode. The results indicate that the interfacial properties between the AQ electrode and the electrolyte have been improved by the use of CMC-Li, specifically by increasing its electrochemical reaction dynamics under the existence of lithium ion for CMC-Li. In addition, the charge-transfer resistance of the cell with the CMC-Li-1/AQ electrode (with a higher DS) is much smaller than for the cell with the CMC-Li-2/AQ electrode. The reason may be that CMC-Li with high DS have more lithium ion than that of low DS, which indicates CMC-Li-1 a good lithium-ion conductive binder.
from Soup: 20 The CV curves of AQ electrodes prepared using the three different binders are illustrated in Fig. 6 . As expected, the oxidation and reduction reaction peaks of different electrodes appear at different potentials. According to the CV curves of the first two cycles, the use of the CMC-Li binder shows a smaller distance between the oxidation reaction peak and the reduction reaction peak compared to the PVDF binder. In addition, the CV curves of AQ electrodes prepared using the CMC-Li binder are sharper than those prepared using the PVDF binder, which indicates a smaller degree of polarization.

 ###### 
from test: 21 Considering the above results, CMC-Li as a binder for AQ-based electrodes will enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium batteries. As such, we initiated a preliminarily study into the mechanism of the CMC-Li binder and propose the following model (Fig. 10).
from Soup: 21 Fig. 7 displays the discharge and charge curves of AQ electrodes prepared using the three different binders. At a current density of 0.2 mA.cm −2 , the first discharge capacity of a PVDF/AQ electrode is 197 mAh·g −1 , while the first discharge capacity of a CMC-Li-2/AQ electrode is 223 mAh·g −1 and that of a CMC-Li-1/AQ electrode is 214 mAh·g −1 (cal. according to the amount of AQ). These results indicate a higher utilization ratio of active materials for the composite. As can be seen in Fig. 7 , the distance between the discharge and charge curves of CMC-Li/AQ is smaller than that of PVDF/AQ, which shows that the polarization of the former is weaker than the latter, the result is consistent with the CV tests (Fig. 6 ).

The performance of CMC-Li could be ascribed to strong hydrogen bonds resulting from the action of the –OH groups, which facilitate the formation of an efficient network.3,12, Furthermore, the hydrophilic CMC-Li binder is not soluble in organic electrolytes and has a satisfactory stability in cells; that is, there is a strong adhesion to the electrode structure that maintains the stability.
from Soup: 22 The cycle performance of AQ electrodes prepared using the three different binders is shown in Fig. 8 . Zhao 23 and Song 24 have reported that PVDF/AQ electrode as a cathode of lithium battery had a bad cycling stability. Generally, the cycle performance of a CMC-Li/AQ electrode is much better than that of a PVDF/AQ electrode. Fig. 8 also shows that the capacity decay of both the CMC-Li and PVDF electrodes is severe for the first 10 cycles, while the capacity decay of the CMC-Li/AQ electrode is slow and less serious than the PVDF/AQ electrode after 10 cycles. After 50 cycles, the specific capacity of the CMC-Li-1/AQ electrode is maintained at 62 mAh·g −1 , which is much higher than for the PVDF/AQ electrode (33 mAh·g −1 ). These results confirm that the binder has an important effect on the cycling stability. 3 , 11 , Before 15 th cycles, the capacity fades in the following order: CMC-Li-2>PVDF>CMC-Li-1, when considering the cycle stability, after 15 th cycles, the order of performance of the half-cells made using the different binders is CMC-Li-1>CMC-Li-2>PVDF. Although the initial discharge capacity of the CMC-Li-2/AQ electrode is higher than the CMC-Li-1/AQ electrode, the capacity decay of the CMC-Li-2/AQ electrode is more serious than for the CMC-Li-1/AQ electrode. After 50 cycles, a lower specific capacity is obtained for the CMC-Li-2/AQ electrode.

from test: 23 In addition, CMC-Li is a good lithium-ion conductive binder.10,25, There are many functional groups on the macromolecular chain of CMC-Li (Fig. 10b). During the discharge process, the active substances react with lithium-ions, which come from two possible routes:
from Soup: 23 Fig. 9 shows the impedance response of AQ electrodes prepared using the three different binders. Generally, the high frequency semicircle is attributed to the Li + charge-transfer impedance at the electrode/electrolyte interface. As Fig. 9 clearly shows, the diameters of the semicircles in the high-frequency electrodes with CMC-Li binders are smaller than for the electrode with a PVDF binder, which indicates that the charge-transfer resistance of a cell with a CMC-Li/AQ electrode is much lower than for a cell made from a PVDF/AQ electrode. The results indicate that the interfacial properties between the AQ electrode and the electrolyte have been improved by the use of CMC-Li, specifically by increasing its electrochemical reaction dynamics under the existence of lithium ion for CMC-Li. In addition, the charge-transfer resistance of the cell with the CMC-Li-1/AQ electrode (with a higher DS) is much smaller than for the cell with the CMC-Li-2/AQ electrode. The reason may be that CMC-Li with high DS have more lithium ion than that of low DS, which indicates CMC-Li-1 a good lithium-ion conductive binder.

from Soup: 24 Considering the above results, CMC-Li as a binder for AQ-based electrodes will enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium batteries. As such, we initiated a preliminarily study into the mechanism of the CMC-Li binder and propose the following model (Fig. 10 ).
 ###### 
from test: 25 Lithium-ions on the molecular chain of CMC-Li itself adjacent to the active center of active substances. The reactions between the carboxymethyl and hydroxyl groups from the CMC-Li binder and the lithium-ions will form coordination bonds. Under an electric-field force, lithium-ions can be transmitted along the same molecular chain or adjacent molecular chains, which indicate that the structure of molecular chain will not be destroyed. Eventually, lithium-ions will combine with the AQ particles. That is to say, the use of the CMC-Li binder raises the transport efficiency of lithium-ions and the utilization rate of AQ. In addition, the more –CH2COOLi and –OLi groups the molecular chains have, the more likely lithium-ions will be to transfer. As shown in Fig. 9, the impedance resistance of CMC-Li is smaller than for the PVDF binder, which indicates that the CMC-Li binder plays an active role in the transport of lithium-ions. As shown in Fig. 10, Channel (2) might be a new pathway for lithium-ions transmission.

from test: 27 Fig. 11 shows the CV curves of the CMC-Li-1 binder. We used CMC-Li-1 as the active material for the electrode. As shown in Fig. 11, for the first cycle, the irreversible reduction reaction peaks that appear between 1.5 v and 1.7 v correspond to the reaction between lithium -ions and –CH2COOH and –OH groups from CMC-Li, yielding –CH2COOLi and –OLi groups, respectively. With an increase in the number of –CH2COOLi and –OLi groups, the DS of CMC-Li increases, which means that the organic layers made mostly of the binder on the surface of AQ particles are more stable and therefore more likely to transfer lithium-ions.

Through electronic conductivity tests of the binder films, the electronic conductivity of CMC-Li films was shown to be far superior to those of PVDF films. Hence, the outstanding cycling performance and cycle life of the CMC-Li electrodes can be explained by the electronic and ionic conduction of the CMC-Li binder. Therefore, CMC-Li can serve as a good binder, disperser and stabilizer.

from test: 29 The CMC-Li binder was prepared in two steps. The first step is an acidification reaction, which is followed by a neutralization reaction. Compared with PVDF, the results indicated that the specific capacity and cycle life of the AQ electrodes with CMC-Li increased. The CMC-Li-1/AQ cathode achieved a high initial capacity of 214 mAh.g−1 and remained at a reversible capacity of 62 mAh·g−1 after 50 cycles, all of which were better than for a PVDF/AQ cathode under the same conditions. In addition, the electrochemical performance of CMC-Li-1 with higher DS (DS = 1.00) is superior to CMC-Li-2 with a lower DS (DS = 0.62). The reason for the improved electrochemical performance is that the ionic conductivity of CMC-Li makes the lithium-ion transmission process easier, which provides a new pathway for lithium-ions toward and away from active particles during the charge and discharge process. The good electrical conductivity of CMC-Li also plays a key role in improving the capacity and cycling stability of the CMC-Li/AQ electrode.

from test: 32 Recently, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has been extensively used in commercial lithium batteries due to its excellent properties. It does not get reduced at low potential (5 mV versus Li/Li+) nor oxidized at high potential (5 V versus Li/Li+) at room temperature. However, it has been reported that PVDF reacts with lithium metal and LiC6 to form LiF5 and –(–C=C–F)– species via an exothermic reaction that increases the risk for the onset of thermal runaway. Additionally, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), which is generally used as a solvent to dissolve PVDF, has the following shortcomings: (1) a high cost, (2) a high boiling point, and (3) it is not an environmentally friendly solvent. Therefore, research on aqueous binders has also been carried out. Aqueous binders have many advantages: they are low cost and environmentally friendly nature, and there is no requirement for strict control of the processing humidity.6 Because of these advantages, water-soluble binders have already been studied for use in rechargeable Lithium batteries.7–9

from test: 33 Cellulose is known to be a renewable natural polymer, and a variety of water-soluble and oil-soluble cellulose derivatives can be obtained by etherification and esterification reactions. These materials have the advantages of being biodegradable, nontoxic, harmless and biocompatible. Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is a linear derivative of cellulose with carboxymethyl groups. The presence of these groups makes the CMC water-soluble.

from test: 34 Li et al.10,11, showed that Si electrodes made using a CMC binder had an improved cycling performance and a better capacity retention compared to those made with a PVDF binder. These results were confirmed by Jernej Drofenik et al.12 Chao et al.13 reported that the electrochemical performance of negative electrodes for Lithium-ion batteries made with hollow spherical NiO particles improved depending on the CMC binder used. The authors obtained a discharge capacity of 547 mAh·g−1, and only 157 mAh·g−1 was observed for electrodes made with a PVDF binder beyond 40 cycles. Furthermore, CMC had been successfully used as a binder with Li4Ti5O1214 and commercial SnO2 nanoparticles.15
from test: 35 Compared with other metal salts of CMC, the lithium salt of CMC (CMC-Li) does not introduce other metal ions, so an exchange reaction of lithium ions in an electrolysis solution will be suppressed during the charge and discharge processes.16 Currently, only a few studies have tried to address the synthesis of CMC-Li and the issues that affect the mechanism. In this work, CMC-Lis of different degrees of substitution were prepared in two steps. We selected 9,10–anthraquinone (AQ) because of its excellent electrochemical reversibility17,18, as a cathode material and compared the effect of different binders (PVDF and CMC-Lis with different DS) on the electrochemical performance of the AQ electrodes. Finally, a preliminary study of the mechanism of CMC was proposed.
