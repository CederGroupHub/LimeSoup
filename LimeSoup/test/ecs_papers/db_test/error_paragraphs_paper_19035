from test: 0 In this work we present a systematic study on post-implantation phosphorous diffusion control in Ge by co-implanted nitrogen in combination with various surface capping layers (Al2O3, SiO2 and Si3N4). Phosphorous has been implanted at low energy (11 keV) and high dose (1015 cm−2) in p-Ge (100) already implanted or not with low energy (10 keV−5 × 1014 cm−2) N2+. Flash Lamp Annealing (FLA) at 800–850°C for 20 ms in inert ambient has been used as post-implantation annealing scheme. In the absence of nitrogen, significant substrate damage and capping layer deterioration prevents a reliable comparison among the three capping materials. The presence of nitrogen in the Ge substrate, effectively suppresses the damage observed after the FLA. In this case, P diffusion is additionally retarded in the presence of Al2O3 as compared to SiO2 and Si3N4. The experimental results constitute a direct evidence of the action of the three capping layers as sinks for Ge vacancies with different interface recombination velocities. On the contrary, the nitrogen diffusion data suggest that interface recombination velocities of Ge interstitials are almost independent of the capping layer choice.

from test: 1 The formation of shallow and highly activated n+/p junctions in Germanium remains still a challenging issue for advanced n-channel Ge MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors) and Ge-based optoelectronic devices fabrication.1,2 The main reason is the fast n-type dopant (P, As, Sb) diffusion in Ge, which takes place via a vacancy-mediated mechanism.3 The parallel significant out-diffusion trend of P, As or Sb in Ge leads to enhanced dopant dose loss, which, together with clustering phenomena, constitute additional problems for achieving high activation levels.

SiO2 is the typical CL used in the majority of the above-mentioned works, deposited either by PECVD or sputtering. However, P diffusion in Ge shows a significant dependence on the CL. It has been shown that during furnace annealing, Si3N4 prevents significant P out-diffusion thus enhancing diffusion to the bulk (P diffusion is concentration–dependent) as compared to SiO2.13 CL engineering could be an important issue for the control of P diffusion in Ge. However, comparison databases of P diffusion on CLs are rather absent in the literature. In parallel, there are no data available on the deterioration of the Ge-CL system under the extreme thermal budgets of non-conventional annealing schemes, such as Flash Lamp Annealing (FLA) in the millisecond (ms) regime. A damaged CL during annealing could result in Ge substrate loss effect enhancing enormously P dose loss.

In silicon technology, the influence of specific interfaces, such as SiO2/Si and Si3N4/Si, on point defect kinetics and, consequently, on dopant diffusion has been extensively studied and modeled. The main reasons for that were the different point defect recombination velocities at CL/Si interfaces14,15 and the stress induced by surface films.16,17 In the case of Ge, such a systematic study is still missing and the rare experimental data, regarding the action either of the free Ge surface or the SiO2/Ge interface as point defect sinks, are controversial.18–20 It should be also mentioned that the majority of approaches on P diffusion suppression have been demonstrated for medium energy implants, i.e. the proximity range of the implantation profiles is sufficiently far away from CL/Ge interfaces. Consequently, their effectiveness in the case of low/very low implantation energies should be also tested.

from test: 7 Based mainly on the fact that nitrogen suppresses oxidation-enhanced diffusion of implanted boron in silicon,21 we began a systematic study of the influence of implanted nitrogen on P diffusion in Ge. The starting point was the study of nitrogen diffusion in Ge, which has been proved non-Fickian (anomalous) toward the surface, independent on the CL (Al2O3, SiO2, Si3N4), suggesting an interstitial-mediated mechanism as in the case of silicon.22 The second step was the study of P/N co-diffusion in low energy-high dose N2+/P+ co-implanted Ge substrates.8 Al2O3 has been used as CL and RTA at 550–650°C has been selected as the annealing scheme. A strong P diffusion suppression, attributed to the formation of PnNm clusters, has been observed, leading to junction depths ∼40 nm. This was accompanied by significant reduction of P dose loss (∼20% only). The results were encouraging, taking especially into account the proximity of the as-implanted profiles to the Al2O3/Ge interface.

The preheating is considered to be beneficial avoiding thus extreme temperature excursions during FLA, which may damage the substrates.23 The annealing processes were performed at IonServices Dresden, Germany.

from test: 13 Figure 1a shows a cross-section TEM image of the 1 × 1015 cm−2 P+ as-implanted Ge substrate. The amorphization depth extends to ∼27 nm from the free surface. After the deposition of the Al2O3 CL at 300°C (30 nm on the top and 10 on the back side of the sample), the substrate has been recrystallized to a great extent. Figure 1b indicates that the amorphous-crystalline interface is not parallel to the Ge/Al2O3 interface, and the remaining amorphous layer has a maximum depth of 6 nm. This finding is in agreement with literature reports, which indicate that Ge recrystallization initiates at 300°C. Considering that the total time of the Al2O3 deposition is about 45 min, the thickness of recrystallized Ge layer is estimated to be at high end of the reported values.24 Since the sputtering of SiO2 and Si3N3 was performed at 250°C, no significant recrystallization of the substrate is expected during their deposition. In any case, these initial differences of the amorphous layers after the CL depositions are eliminated after the preheating step at 450°C for 4 min (recrystallization rate ∼20 nm/sec according to the data of Ref. 24) prior to the main flash lamp annealing. Consequently, it is not expected to have any significant impact on P diffusion at 800–850°C.

from test: 15 SEM surface images of the Al2O3 CL case are shown in Fig. 2a. The surface of the CL shows a dense pattern of almost circular pits with diameter in the range of 0.13 to 1 μm. In addition, the surface exhibits a high density of small nano-pores. The same pattern was observed on the surface of the Ge substrate after the removal of the CL as can be seen in Fig. 2b. AFM imaging of the circular pits (inset of Fig. 2a), before the removal of the CL, shows that the Al2O3 forms a protrusion at the central area of each pit. Tapping mode AFM phase imaging indicated that Al2O3 covers the whole area of the circular pit. These circular pits are attributed to Ge thermal etching due to argon penetration of the CL, possibly through Al2O3 pinholes and/or grains, and subsequent Ge surface oxidation. Such type of damage has also been observed by Gatos and Lavine25 in the case of uncapped (111) Ge conventional annealing in argon at 700°C for 24 hrs. The etched Ge becomes volatile GeO, thus lifting the CL at the central region of the pit. ALD as-deposited alumina is amorphous and it is transformed to polycrystalline after conventional annealing at temperatures T ≥ 850°C.26 However, one could not exclude a partial transformation at lower temperature under ms-FLA conditions leading to the formation of small grains and pinholes.

In the case of low temperature conventional annealing (e.g. 576°C for 30 min in nitrogen), the uncapped Ge substrate damage appears in the form of deep almost circular etch pits.13 Gatos and Lavine,25 studied the damage on non-protected (111), (110) and (100) Ge substrates after long duration (order of days) conventional annealing in argon, hydrogen or vacuum at 700–925°C. A variety of damage configurations (from “pocking”, triangles and circular holes to spiral and wormlike structures) has been detected. More recently, Boldrini et al.,27 studying P doping of Ge using the spin-on-doping technique and spike annealing at 600–750°C, observed small rectangular etch pits (with depth of ∼30–50 nm) on Ge surface. The authors attributed the formation of these pits to environmental moisture. Nothing reminds (either as precursor or as evolution) the rectangles with protrusions presented here.

from test: 24 However, the formation of similar rectangles with protrusions has been reported by Smith et al.28 during the 3C-SiC growth on Si substrates using CVD deposition of SiC and FLA at temperatures close to the Silicon melting point. Their formation has been attributed to the nucleation and particular evolution of molten superficial Silicon seeds. They reported also coalescence of rectangles. In addition, they managed to suppress their formation and subsequent surface roughness by carbon implantation, demonstrating that implanted carbon acts as melting blocker of the silicon substrate. The similarities between the two works (compare e.g. Fig. 2a of Ref. 28 and Fig. 3a of the present work) are obvious. Figure 4 represents schematically the evolution of this particular kind of damage in the case of (100) Ge, based on the results of the above mentioned work.

The similarities between the two works (compare e.g. Fig. 2a of Ref. 28 and Fig. 3a of the present work) are obvious. Figure 4 represents schematically the evolution of this particular kind of damage in the case of (100) Ge, based on the results of the above mentioned work. The procedure is described in the corresponding figure caption.

from test: 25 As the above process takes place in the case of Al2O3 capped sample, the Ge protrusions penetrate the CL, as shown in Figs. 3a–3b, and, exposed to argon, become more flat and porous due to thermal etching. This penetration is possibly assisted by the formed grain boundaries, due to the transformation of the initially amorphous Al2O3 to polycrystalline, at this elevated temperature. On the contrary, the protrusion formation does not result to a rupture of the SiO2 CL. As shown in Figure 3c, the underlying damage topography is reflected as a “stamp” in the SiO2 film. Finally, the extended Si3N4 exfoliation and the increased temperature lead to significant thermal etching of the protrusions and of the entire Ge substrate shown in Figure 3f.

from test: 26 Taking into account the morphology of the Ge substrate after FLA, it is expected that P diffusion study by dynamic SIMS will not be a trivial issue, and the results, especially at 850°C, will be questionable. Both the quantification in atomic concentration and the SIMS depth resolution are affected by the extended damage and the rough Ge surface. The corresponding P diffusion profiles, together with the estimated P dose loss, at 800–850°C are presented in Figure 5. The Al2O3 CL appears to result in a faster P in-diffusion, followed by the SiO2 and Si3N4 CLs. However, the overall picture is misleading, due to the surface roughness and substrate loss, especially in the samples covered with Al2O3 and Si3N3.

from test: 27 A characteristic example is the comparison between the SiO2 and the Si3N4 – capped samples. Apparently, the present results are in contradiction to the results of Ref. 13, where it was demonstrated that P diffuses faster in the presence of Si3N4 in comparison to SiO2 during conventional furnace annealing at 500°C (where no deterioration of CLs has been observed). In fact, the reduced P dose loss in the presence of Si3N4 at 800°C, we report herein, is compatible to the results of Ref. 13. However, this reduced dose loss is counterbalanced by the simultaneous thermal etching of the substrate due to partial exfoliation of the film. As the temperature increases to 850°C, Ge substrate loss dominates, and consequent P dose loss exceeds the corresponding of the SiO2–capped sample. At both temperatures P diffusion appears reduced in the presence of Si3N4 due to Ge substrate loss and not due to CL influence. Since Ge substrate loss depends on the annealing ambient and flux,13,29 it is, unfortunately, not possible to estimate the amount of Ge lost from the Si3N4–capped samples, due to the lack of literature data regarding the specific experimental conditions.

from test: 30 Figure 6a is a cross-section TEM image of the N2+/ P+ as-implanted Ge substrate. We observe that the amorphization depth extends to ∼29 nm from the free surface. A comparison to the result of P single implant (Fig. 1a) shows that phosphorous implantation control the thickness of the Ge amorphous layer in both cases. Furthermore, after the deposition of the Al2O3 CL at 300°C, no significant recrystallization of the substrate has been observed (image not shown). The amorphization depth is reduced slightly to ∼25nm, similar to the case of Ref. 8 (i.e. 40 nm Al2O3 CL deposited at 300°C on the top of Ge substrate). This result demonstrates that the presence of nitrogen in the substrate affects the recrystallization rate of amorphous Ge layer. It is expected that after deposition of SiO2 and Si3N4 at the lower temperature of 250°C, the amorphous layer will vary between 25 and 29 nm. Since these differences are almost negligible, in the rest of the study a common amorphous layer of ∼25 nm is assumed as the starting point before annealing for all different CLs.

from test: 32 Figure 7a is a plan-view SEM image of the sample capped with Al2O3 and annealed at 800°C for 20 ms. The image has been taken before removing the CL. We clearly observe the absence of any significant damage on the film (the circular pits and pores shown in Fig. 2a), indicating also absence of damage on Ge substrate. Indeed, after removing the CL, a similar picture has been revealed (not shown). This is confirmed also by AFM measurements (Fig. 7b), performed at nine different and randomly chosen 5 × 5 μm2 areas of the sample. The measured average rms roughness on the Ge substrate is ∼0.7 ± 0.3 nm, very similar to the rms roughness of the initial Ge wafers (0.60 ± 0.02 nm). This could be attributed to the incorporation of nitrogen within the alumina film during FLA, which prevents crystallization and thus the formation of grain boundaries/pinholes and the consequent Ge substrate etching due to the penetration of Ar atoms. Indeed, recent studies30 demonstrated that the presence of nitrogen within ALD deposited Al2O3 films retards its transformation to polycrystalline during annealing at high temperatures. Alternatively, the remaining nitrogen in the substrate prevents Ge oxidation even in the case that Ar could penetrate the alumina film. The same overall picture has been also revealed for the SiO2 and Si3N4-capped samples. The incorporation of nitrogen within the Si3N4 film prevents its exfoliation and the subsequent thermal etching of the substrate, as shown in Figures 7c–7d. The experimental values of the average rms roughness of Ge substrates for the three samples are summarized in Table I.

from test: 33 The results are more impressive when FLA takes place at 850°C, where the presence of nitrogen in the Ge substrate completely suppressed the formation of the rectangles with protrusions observed in the case of P single-doping implant at the same temperature. This is clearly shown in Figs. 8a–8b for the Al2O3 and SiO2-capped samples. Since the formation of protrusions at this temperature is a result of Ge surface melting seeds evolution, then it is obvious that implanted nitrogen acts as a Ge substrate melting blocker, like the implanted carbon in silicon.28 The incorporation of nitrogen didn't completely prevent Si3N4 exfoliation at this elevated temperature. In this case the Ge substrate has been once again exposed to Ar atmosphere. Hence, substrate loss and consequent increased P and N dose loss is expected in comparison to Al2O3 and SiO2-capped samples. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 8c, we observe once again the formation of (now etched) rectangles with protrusions in the substrate, attributed in this case to the increased nitrogen dose loss. Furthermore, the influence of the remaining nitrogen is reflected in the suppression of the overall substrate thermal etching as compared to the P single-doping case at the same temperature of Fig. 3f.

from test: 39 P bulk diffusion beyond the a/c interface depends strongly on the CL. The use of Si3N3 leads now to the faster and the use of Al2O3 to the slower bulk diffusion, as shown in Fig. 9. This is an extremely important result, taking into account that the remaining P dose is the same in the presence of the three different capping layers at 800°C. Up to now, it has been demonstrated13 that using Si3N4, P single-doping diffusion is enhanced (due to lower out-diffusion) as compared to the use of SiO2. In the present experiment, P out diffusion is the same in all the three cases examined, due to similar clustering with nitrogen at the CL/Ge interfacial region. As the temperature increases to 850°C, the same is observed for the Al2O3 and SiO2-capped samples, although P out-diffusion is slightly higher (∼7%) in the case of SiO2.

from Soup: 42 In the case of single P implant, FLA leads to significant Ge substrate damage. At 800°C, the Ge damage is a typical result of thermal etching due to CLs (Al 2 O 3 and Si 3 N 4 ) deterioration and the exposure of Ge to the annealing ambient. Only SiO 2 proved a reliable capping layer at this temperature. At 850°C, Ge substrate damage (in the form of rectangles with protrusions) is independent on the CL, being a result of Ge surface melting. At both temperatures, Si 3 N 4 proved the most unreliable capping layer due to its partial or extended exfoliation leading to significant Ge substrate loss. In the case of P single-doping implant, it is not possible to conclude on CL influence on phosphorous diffusion in Ge, since, in addition, Al 2 O 3 and Si 3 N 4 cannot assumed as being attached to the Ge substrate during FLA.

from Soup: 43 Nitrogen co-implant proved extremely beneficial in suppressing or completely eliminating Ge substrate damage during FLA. At 800°C, diffusion of nitrogen atoms within the capping layers completely blocked penetration of Ar atoms and subsequent substrate thermal etching. At 850°C, nitrogen suppressed the formation of rectangles with protrusions acting as an effective Ge melting blocker. The results of Figures 8 and 11 , demonstrate that a remaining nitrogen dose ≥6 × 10 14 cm −2 is enough for efficient Ge surface melting blocking.

from Soup: 44 Moreover, in the case of N and P co-implant, P diffusion dependence on the CL is demonstrated for the first time under experimental conditions that maintain almost the same remaining phosphorous dose during annealing. Consequently, the presence of nitrogen in the substrate enabled P diffusion control by “capping layer engineering” during FLA. In the absence of extended EOR defects in the substrate, the results could be explained only if we accept that the CLs affect either the equilibrium concentrations or the recombination rate of the Ge point defects (vacancies and interstitials) at the near CL/Ge interface region. The rest of this section is dedicated to this issue.

from Soup: 45 The effect of SiO 2 and Si 3 N 4 capping layers on Si (equilibrium) point defects concentrations has been modelled and experimentally studied by Park et al. 16 and Chaudhry and Law. 17 These works demonstrated that compressive stress induced in the silicon substrate (e.g by Si 3 N 4 deposition at 900°C) decreases the equilibrium concentration of Si interstitials and increases the equilibrium concentration of Si vacancies. On the other hand, tensile stress induced in the silicon substrate (e.g. by SiO 2 growth) has the opposite effects on the equilibrium Si point defects concentrations. In the case of low temperature deposited films, as in the present work, no significant substrate strain is expected. This has been verified by Raman spectroscopy measurements (see Appendix) performed after the deposition of the CL, either in non-implanted samples or in samples implanted with P and N and annealed at 450°C for 4 min (the initial preheating step before FLA). Consequently, stress induced by the capping layers deposition could be safely excluded as the origin of P diffusion control in the present experiment.

from test: 47 In the rest, we examine how the assumption of different recombination rates of Ge vacancies and interstitials at the CL/Ge interfaces could explain the present results within the frames of the phenomenological analysis on P diffusion suppression by N co-implantation presented in Ref. 8.
from Soup: 47 One of the scenarios developed to explain the retardation of P diffusion in the presence of co-implanted nitrogen is based only on the assumption of P n N m clusters formation. Similar argument has been more recently presented to explain P diffusion suppression by N 2 co-implantation during ms laser annealing. 33 The results of Ref. 8 , obtained at the same implantation conditions but using (instead of FLA) RTA at 550–650°C for 30 sec, suggest that clustering between P and N may extend in the entire distributions of both species up to 600°C. At 650°C, P n N m clusters dissolve initially only at the tail region of the profiles beyond the a/c interface. This presumes the existence of different P n N m cluster configurations and of different stability between the peak (more stable clusters) and tail regions (less stable clusters) of the distributions. In the present experiment, P and N clustering could take place even during the preheating step at 450°C. Under the thermal shock of the FLA, P is completely released from N beyond the a/c interface due to less stable P n N m clusters dissolution. In parallel, an interstitial supersaturation is created at the EOR region due to ion implantation. During the early stage of the preheating step at 450°C, the excess interstitials surviving recombination with vacancies and/or absorption by the CL/Ge interface, agglomerate to form the so called extrinsic (interstitial-composed) EOR defects. EOR defects in Ge are not so stable (especially when formed close to Ge surface), 19 , 32 and dissolve during the main FLA step at 800–850°C releasing interstitials. Consequently, an interstitial gradient is created during FLA between the EOR region and the CL/Ge interface, which acts as a Ge interstitials sink. 22 Nitrogen diffuses toward the CL/Ge interface due to the existence of this gradient. Part of the excess EOR interstitials contributes to nitrogen anomalous diffusion, while the rest recombine with vacancies thus suppressing P bulk diffusion. However, the present experimental results (N anomalous diffusion independent on the CL), confirm once again 22 that Ge interstitials recombination velocity at the CL/interface is almost independent on the CL. This, consequently, is also valid for the EOR interstitial supersaturation. On the contrary, P bulk diffusion shows significant dependence on the CL used. This suggest that Ge vacancies concentration near the CL/Ge interface is strongly affected by the CLs, and that Al 2 O 3 , SiO 2 and Si 3 N 4 act also as vacancy sinks with different absorption rates. Alumina shows the highest Ge vacancy recombination velocity and Si 3 N 4 the lowest. This additional vacancy annihilation mechanism dominates and, finally, controls P bulk diffusion beyond the a/c interface.

Similar argument has been more recently presented to explain P diffusion suppression by N2 co-implantation during ms laser annealing.33 The results of Ref. 8, obtained at the same implantation conditions but using (instead of FLA) RTA at 550–650°C for 30 sec, suggest that clustering between P and N may extend in the entire distributions of both species up to 600°C. At 650°C, PnNm clusters dissolve initially only at the tail region of the profiles beyond the a/c interface. This presumes the existence of different PnNm cluster configurations and of different stability between the peak (more stable clusters) and tail regions (less stable clusters) of the distributions. In the present experiment, P and N clustering could take place even during the preheating step at 450°C. Under the thermal shock of the FLA, P is completely released from N beyond the a/c interface due to less stable PnNm clusters dissolution. In parallel, an interstitial supersaturation is created at the EOR region due to ion implantation. During the early stage of the preheating step at 450°C, the excess interstitials surviving recombination with vacancies and/or absorption by the CL/Ge interface, agglomerate to form the so called extrinsic (interstitial-composed) EOR defects. EOR defects in Ge are not so stable (especially when formed close to Ge surface),19,32 and dissolve during the main FLA step at 800–850°C releasing interstitials. Consequently, an interstitial gradient is created during FLA between the EOR region and the CL/Ge interface, which acts as a Ge interstitials sink.22 Nitrogen diffuses toward the CL/Ge interface due to the existence of this gradient. Part of the excess EOR interstitials contributes to nitrogen anomalous diffusion, while the rest recombine with vacancies thus suppressing P bulk diffusion. However, the present experimental results (N anomalous diffusion independent on the CL), confirm once again22 that Ge interstitials recombination velocity at the CL/interface is almost independent on the CL. This, consequently, is also valid for the EOR interstitial supersaturation. On the contrary, P bulk diffusion shows significant dependence on the CL used. This suggest that Ge vacancies concentration near the CL/Ge interface is strongly affected by the CLs, and that Al2O3, SiO2 and Si3N4 act also as vacancy sinks with different absorption rates. Alumina shows the highest Ge vacancy recombination velocity and Si3N4 the lowest. This additional vacancy annihilation mechanism dominates and, finally, controls P bulk diffusion beyond the a/c interface.
from Soup: 48 According to this scenario, P and N clustering is taking place only at the peak concentration region of the distributions within the former amorphous region. The formed P n N m clusters are very stable, and “surviving” the subsequent FLA annealing, immobilize P and N within this region. Within this approach, the EOR interstitial supersaturation is maintained via a different mechanism during annealing. Beyond the former a/c interface, and even during the preheating step at 450°C, nitrogen could form clusters (N n I m ) with part of the excess Ge interstitials at the EOR region. This trend has been already experimentally verified in the case of N single-doping diffusion study of Ref. 22 . This specific clustering prevents the absorption of the majority of EOR excess Ge interstitials by the CL/interface or the recombination with vacancies during the preheating step at 450°C, as also the formation of EOR defects. Nitrogen-Ge interstitials clusters are stable up to 650°C 2.2 Consequently, during FLA at 800–850°C, these clusters dissolve releasing excess Ge interstitials at the EOR region. Regardless of the creation of EOR interstitial supersaturation, it appears again independent on the CL (this is reflected to N diffusion results) and can't alone explain the corresponding P bulk diffusion dependence. In order to explain the presented results, we should again accept the action of the capping layers as simultaneous Ge vacancies sinks with different absorption rates.

from Soup: 49 The main idea of both scenarios is represented graphically in Figure 12a . Regardless of the scenarios presented, the experiment demonstrated the action of the three capping layers as Ge point defects sinks. Ge interstitials recombination velocity appears almost independent on the nature of CL/interface, while vacancies recombination rate is reduced as we change the capping layer from Al 2 O 3 to SiO 2 and, finally, to Si 3 N 4 . It should be emphasized that these results could not be obtained at the specific experimental conditions without the presence of nitrogen in the substrate.

from Soup: 50 Additional work is required to correctly model the Ge point defect recombination rates at various CL/Ge interfaces. In the case of Si technology, a variety of models supported by a series of experiments dedicated to this issue have been tested, the most representative being point defect recombination at interface kinks and jogs (see Figure 12b ) and segregation at the interface and diffusion of point defects within the capping layer (see Figure 12c ). In addition, point defects recombination velocities could be either constant (low temperatures / long annealing times) 14 or time - dependent (high temperatures/short annealing times). 15 Such experiments and models in the case of Ge are still missing, but are emerging toward the control of n-type dopant diffusion by “capping layer engineering”.

from Soup: 51 For example, one could, based on silicon experience, 34 argue that the presence of nitrogen at the CL/Ge interfaces could affect the corresponding vacancy recombination rates (by filling available recombination sites or by blocking segregation). Since interfacial nitrogen concentration is almost independent on the capping layer, ( Figures 9 and 10 ) how could the P diffusion dependence be explained ? In this case we should, possibly, exclude the recombination at interfacial kinks / jogs as the vacancy annihilation mechanism, and suggest a segregation / diffusion mechanism, which depends also on the composition of the capping layer. Otherwise, we should accept that P diffusion control is a pure electrostatic effect, dependent on the charges present within the capping layers. However, it is questionable how fixed charges within the dielectrics could attract or repel a P concentration of the order of 10 19 /cm 3 .

from Soup: 52 In conclusion, nitrogen co-implantation proved extremely beneficial for the employment of high temperature FLA in Ge MOS technology. N co-implantation and the use of Al 2 O 3 as capping layer constitute a promising combination for shallow junctions formation in Ge using FLA as annealing scheme. A comparison between the results of Figures 9 and 10 suggests that the presence of nitrogen and the increased vacancy recombination velocity at the Al 2 O 3 /Ge interface, leads to shallower P profiles at 850°C as compared to 800°C, and, most important, in a damage-free Ge substrate. Although P diffusion suppression and dose loss is not so effective under the present experimental conditions as compared to the Al 2 O 3 /RTA combination of Ref. 8 , the process is multi-parametric and enables a variety of modifications/improvements, which are under investigation.

from Soup: 54 Raman spectroscopy has been widely used to detect the mechanical strain distribution in semiconductor substrates by analyzing mainly the corresponding shift in the peak position of certain Raman modes. 35 – 37 Figure A1 shows Raman spectra of the samples implanted with N 2 + and P + and capped with Al 2 O 3 , SiO 2 and Si 3 N 4 after the preheating step at 450°C for 4min. The spectra of the annealed samples are compared to the corresponding of the uncapped and non-annealed Ge substrate. Raman spectra were collected in the backscattering geometry using a Renishaw InVia 2000 Raman spectrometer, equipped with a 2400 grooves/mm grating, providing a spectral resolution of nearly 2 cm −1 and a spectral accuracy close to 0.1 cm −1 . For excitation the 514.5 nm line of an Ar + laser was focused on the sample by means of a 100x objective (NA = 0.85) yielding a spot-size less than 1 μm. In order to avoid damage of the samples the excitation power was kept below 0.25 mW. In total, 120 spectra were collected for each studied sample. The triply degenerate optical phonon mode of Ge appeared as a single peak at 300 cm −1 . The phonon frequencies were determined by fitting a single Lorentzian function to the experimental data after background subtraction.

from Soup: 55 The overlayers (SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 Si 3 N 4 ) do not contribute to the attenuation of the incident beam due to their nanometer size thickness and their insulating nature. For strongly absorbing materials such as Ge, the Raman signal comes from a scattering volume defined by the light penetration depth. For the 514.5 nm (2.41 eV) excitation, the penetration depth in Ge is about 20 nm. 38 This allow us to assess the magnitude of mechanical strain imparted on Ge in the interface region. The mean peak position of the first-order Raman mode of Ge is identical in all the studied samples including the reference sample, located at 300.0 cm −1 and exhibiting a quite small standard deviation of less than 0.1 cm −1 . It should be mentioned that under hydrostatic pressure the Ge pressure slope is about 4 cm −1 /GPa. 38 Therefore, the buildup of strain under the specific deposition and annealing conditions is negligible.
