from test: 0 We present an open circuit voltage (OCV) model for lithium ion (Li-ion) cells, which can be parameterized by measurements of the OCV of positive and negative electrode half-cells and a full cell. No prior knowledge of physical parameters related to particular cell chemistries is required. The OCV of the full cell is calculated from two electrode sub-models, which are comprised of additive terms that represent the phase transitions of the active electrode materials. The model structure is flexible and can be applied to any Li-ion cell chemistry. The model can account for temperature dependence and voltage hysteresis of the OCV. Fitting the model to OCV data recorded from a Li-ion cell at 0°C, 10°C, 20°C, 30°C and 40°C yielded high accuracies with errors (RMS) of less than 5 mV. The model can be used to maintain the accuracy of dynamic Li-ion cell models in battery management systems by accounting for the effects of capacity fade on the OCV. Moreover, the model provides a means to separate the cell's OCV into its constituent electrode potentials, which allows the electrodes’ capacities to be tracked separately over time, providing an insight into prevalent degradation mechanisms acting on the individual electrodes.

from test: 1 The open circuit voltage (OCV) of lithium ion (Li-ion) cells plays a central role in battery models used in battery management systems (BMS) for a wide range of applications from consumer electronics to automotive systems. The OCV of a battery cell is the potential difference between the positive electrode (PE) and the negative electrode (NE) when no current flows and the electrode potentials are at equilibrium. A battery undergoing charge or discharge does not exhibit this potential since it is modified by kinetic effects such as mass transport. However, the OCV of a battery over the full range of states of charge can be obtained by charging or discharging the battery utilizing a galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and measuring the potential at the end of each relaxation period (assuming the period is long enough to reach equilibrium). All dynamic battery models rely on the knowledge of the relationship between OCV and cell capacity in order to produce accurate estimates of internal battery states such as the state of charge (SOC) and the state of health (SOH). The SOC of a cell is a measure of how much charge remains within the cell relative to its maximal capacity. The SOC is generally expressed as a percentage; SOC = 100% indicates a fully charged cell and SOC = 0% a fully discharged cell. The SOH describes the performance deterioration of a cell at any point in time compared to the cell's initial performance. Two important metrics for the SOH are capacity fade and the increase in internal resistance, which relates to power fade. Capacity fade affects the OCV of a cell, which must be accounted for in dynamic cell models in a BMS, to ensure continued accuracy.

However, since capacity fade affects the relationship between OCV and cell capacity as the cell degrades, dynamic cell models become increasingly inaccurate if their underlying OCV expression does not account for capacity fade. Although capacity fade can theoretically be estimated in on-line systems,7 the subtle changes in the shape of the OCV curve that occur as a result of degradation are usually not considered.

from test: 6 The term half-cells used in this work describes electrochemical cells consisting of active electrode materials (graphite in case of the NE and NMC in case of the PE) as working electrodes and lithium foil as counter electrodes, fabricated in coin cell format. Electrode material was extracted from Kokam pouch cells in an argon atmosphere inside a glove box. The pouch cell was cut open with a scalpel and samples of the PE and NE (active material on current collectors) were removed from the stack. The electrodes were cut into disks of 15 mm diameter using a hole punch, giving 1.77 cm2 of active electrode areas for both the PE and the NE half-cells. In Kokam pouch cells, both sides of the PE and NE current collectors are coated with active electrode material. In order to improve the electronic conductivity between the electrode sample and the coin cell base, and to prevent a disparity in ionic transport between the side of active material that faces the separator and the side that would face away from it and be pressed up against the coin cell base, the active material was removed from one side of the current collector. This was achieved using N-Methyl-2-Pyrrolidone to dissolve the binder of the active material. Dimethyl carbonate was subsequently used to rinse the electrode before assembling the half-cell. The active mass of each electrode was measured by cutting a 15 mm disk of the current collector material (copper for the NE and aluminium for the PE) and removing the active material from both sides of the sample, as described for the half-cell electrodes above. The current collector samples were weighed and their mass was subtracted from the total mass of each half-cell electrode in order to determine the active mass of the half-cell electrodes (see Table I). The half-cell electrodes were placed in a coin cell base, followed by a glass microfiber separator wetted with LP30 (LiPF6 solution in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC); 1.0 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC = 50/50 (wt/wt)) electrolyte, lithium foil as the counter electrode, a spacer, a spring for improved contact and the coin cell lid (see Figure 1).

from test: 7 In this work, we apply the term OCV to the full cell and the electrodes alike. We define the OCV of an electrode as its equilibrium potential, whereby the electrons of both phases of the redox couple, in our case Li/Li+, are in equilibrium.15 The OCV of unmodified commercial Kokam pouch cells, PE and NE half-cells were measured at 0°C, 10°C, 20°C, 30°C and 40°C. All experiments were carried out using BioLogic SP-150 potentiostats inside a Vötsch thermal chamber to control the environmental temperature. Measurements at each temperature were recorded on fresh (uncycled) commercial Kokam cells or newly fabricated electrode half-cells. In order to obtain true OCV measurements over the entire capacity range of the full cells and half-cells, the SOC of the full cells and half-cells was changed incrementally, in steps of 1/50 of the nominal capacity (△Q = Qnom/50), by applying small currents (C/10) and subsequently allowing the cell voltage to relax for one hour. The nominal electrode half-cell capacities, Qnom, were calculated based on their active masses and their known specific capacities (PE: 180 ± 5 mAh/g, NE: 270 ± 5 mAh/g). The OCV measurements were recorded at the end of each relaxation period. This method of OCV measurement is commonly referred to as galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT).16 In order to account for the voltage hysteresis commonly observed in Li-ion cells,17–19 GITT measurements were recorded during incremental charge and discharge. Figure 2 illustrates a GITT measurement on a commercial Kokam cell recorded during incremental discharge. The recording of each GITT data set was preceded by a thermal equilibration period of >3 h at the respective test temperature and a subsequent constant current constant voltage (CCCV) charge. The exact experimental procedures for the GITT tests and preceding charge steps on full cell and half-cells are given in Table II.

from test: 9 We start by formulating the chemical potential μ of intercalated ions. The chemical potential determines the change in internal energy resulting from a change in the concentration of the ionic species.20 The chemical potential at equilibrium can be calculated using the Nernst equation:11 where E0 is the standard redox potential, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and x is the ratio of intercalated sites to available sites in the host structure. In intercalation reactions, E0 reflects the energy of an intercalated ion on a specific site in the lattice of the host material. Not all lattice sites have the same energies in insertion compounds and each type of lattice site hosts a limited number of ions.21 Equation 1 therefore needs to be extended to account for N different site energies E0, i, (where i = {1, 2, …, N}) and the respective fraction of occupied sites x. McKinnon and Haering11 reformulated Equation 1 so that it can be expressed for multiple E0, i according to which is also referred to as Fermi-Dirac distribution.22 Equation 2 can be used to calculate the fraction of occupied sites in a system of N different site energies as a function of the chemical potential μ according to where Δxi is the fraction of occupied sites of energy E0, i. Equations 1 to 3 have been applied by McKinnon and Haering in Ref. 11 in their discussion of lattice gas models for intercalation systems. However, this approach is limited to the particular case where intercalated ions do not interact with each other. In real systems, interactions between intercalated ions cannot be neglected. Such interactions are associated with an interaction energy Ui. In order to account for the short-range interactions between γ neighboring ions in a host lattice, Ohzuku and Ueda12 extended Equation 1 to which gives the chemical potential as a function of occupied lattice sites of energy E0, i. Rearranging Equation 4 to give x(μ) for multiple energy levels E0, i of a typical intercalation material yields impractically complex solutions. We therefore introduce a dimensionless parameter ai in order to approximate the effects of interaction energies and substitute the term γUi(1 − 2xi) in Equation 4 by extending Equation 3 to The chemical potential μ is related to the open circuit voltage EOC by where z is the number of electrons exchanged in the redox reaction (z = 1 for Li-ion systems) and e is the elementary charge. Combining Equations 5 and 6 gives where EOC and E0, i are in Volts. We evaluate Equation 7 with N = 1 by comparing its results to those computed using Equation 4 for a range of interaction energies − 0.4 V < γUie− 1 < 0.07 V (multiplying by the elementary charge e to convert from Joules to Volts). Optimal values for parameter ai are obtained by fitting Equation 7 to the results of Equation 4 computed for each interaction energy by minimizing the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) on EOC(x) using nonlinear least squares fitting in Matlab. Figure 4a shows the comparison of EOC(x) − E0 calculated with Equations 4 and 7, respectively, for different interaction energies. The RMSE on EOC(x) is plotted against a range of γUie− 1 in Figure 4b, alongside the relationship between ai and γUie− 1. The approximation of the term γUie− 1(1 − 2xi) by parameter ai is obviously best close to γUie− 1 = 0, where Equations 4 and 7 are identical. The discrepancy between EOC(γUie− 1, x) and EOC(ai, x) increases for increasingly smaller or larger values of γUie− 1. Figure 4a shows that for large positive values of γUie− 1, the voltage can rise with xLi according to Equation 4, which is considered unphysical.11 This behavior cannot be modeled with Equation 7, which is limited by a constant voltage profile for large absolute values of parameter ai (see Figure 4a: EOC(|a|max, x)).

from test: 11 It should be emphasized at this stage that the objective of this work is not to derive a model for intercalation electrodes from first principles but to build upon established principles (outlined in Equations 1 to 4) in order to create an OCV model for commercial Li-ion cells, which can be identified without prior knowledge of physical parameters of the active electrode materials, and used in a BMS. The first step in the model identification process is to estimate the number of phase transitions that each electrode material undergoes during charge and discharge. Phase transitions can be identified by plateaus in the voltage curves of the half-cells. Since it can be difficult to identify these plateaus in curves of voltage versus capacity, we first differentiate half-cell capacity Q with respect to voltage V (dQ/dV) in order to obtain more clearly visible peaks.23 This is illustrated in Figure 5, where the voltages of the PE and NE half-cells, recorded at 20°C, are shown in the top row (Figure 5a and 5b) and the respective dQ/dVcurves are in the bottom row (Figure 5c and 5d). This analysis indicates that there are four identifiable phases transitions (N = 4) in both positive and negative electrode material, which leads to the PE and NE OCV model equations It should be noted that these equations are intended to capture the observable phase transitions in the active electrode materials, which may not be equivalent to the actual total number of phase transitions that the materials undergo, but is nonetheless still useful for diagnostic and fitting purposes.

from Soup: 24 A small voltage gap or hysteresis between charging and discharging OCV curves is present even when using a technique such as GITT where measurements are taken when no current flows and the cell has returned to its equilibrium potential. This phenomenon has been described in the literature for many common electrode materials used in Li-ion cells, such as graphite, 24 LiMnO 2 17 and LiCoO 2 25 and was also observed with the NMC cells used in this work (see Figure 7 ). Moreover, the magnitude and shape of the voltage hysteresis is temperature dependent in the case of the analyzed cell type and chemistry. Figure 7 illustrates the voltage hysteresis observed between OCV measurements recorded during incremental charge (solid line) and discharge (broken line) in PE (a, b), NE (c, d) and full cell (e, f). OCV measurements displayed in the left column in Figures 7a , 7c , and 7e ) were recorded at T = 0°C and those in the right column (Figures 7b , 7d and 7f ) at T = 40°C. Voltage hysteresis is clearly observable in the full cell (Figures 7e and 7f ) and appears to be largely due to the NE (Figures 7c and 7d ). The maximum hysteresis observed in the full cell is on the order of 46 mV at 0°C and 33 mV at 40°C. The effects of hysteresis in Li-ion NMC cells can therefore not be ignored in an OCV model if accuracies greater than 46 mV are to be achieved. Due to the dependency of the measured OCV of the cell and half-cells on temperature and hysteresis, the parameters of the presented OCV model are estimated for both OCV measurements obtained during incremental charge and discharge at 0°C, 10°C, 20°C, 30°C and 40°C.

Moreover, the magnitude and shape of the voltage hysteresis is temperature dependent in the case of the analyzed cell type and chemistry. Figure 7 illustrates the voltage hysteresis observed between OCV measurements recorded during incremental charge (solid line) and discharge (broken line) in PE (a, b), NE (c, d) and full cell (e, f). OCV measurements displayed in the left column in Figures 7a, 7c, and 7e) were recorded at T = 0°C and those in the right column (Figures 7b, 7d and 7f) at T = 40°C.

The OCV data displayed in Figure 9 is the mean of incremental charge and discharge data recorded on PE and NE half-cells at 20°C. The estimation procedure was carried out for OCV data recorded at 0°C, 10°C, 20°C, 30°C and 40°C. RMSE between ÊPEOC and E OC PE , and ÊNEOC and E OC NE did not exceed 15 mV.

Figure 10 also shows the estimated OCV of the PE, ÊPEOC , and NE, ÊNEOC , comprising ÊCellOC , as well as the measured OCV of the PE and NE half-cells E OC PE (diamond markers) and E OC NE (triangular markers). The estimation procedure was carried out for OCV data recorded at 0°C, 10°C, 20°C, 30°C and 40°C. RMSE and maximal errors for ÊPEOC , ÊNEOC , and ÊCellOC are given in Table IV . RMSE values did not exceed 5 mV and maximal errors did not exceed 22 mV for all fits, which indicates that the model is well suited for a temperature range between 0°C and 40°C and for both charging and discharging OCV. Figure 11 shows the residuals of the OCV fits for the full cells, the PE half-cells and the NE half-cells as a function of SOC, which demonstrates that the fitting errors do not exceed 10 mV for a cell SOC greater than 10%. The high fitting accuracies for the OCV of both the full cell and the electrode half-cells, achieved in the combined fitting procedure, shows that the integrity of the electrode sub-models is maintained in the full cell model. This is an important feature when using the presented OCV model to track changes in the OCV of the electrodes, as cells degrade.

Most of the estimated parameters show little dependence on temperature and hysteresis, which indicates scope for simplification of the temperature and hysteresis dependence of the individual parameters.

from Soup: 29 The temperature dependence of PE parameters is mostly reflected by a slight increase in parameter Δ x PE , 4 , while all other parameters Δ x PE decrease for the PE. Parameter Δ x PE , 4 represents high levels of lithiation in the PE. A relative increase in this parameter compared to the remaining parameters Δ x PE , i indicates that more lithium is inserted into the PE during discharge of the cell at higher temperatures, which is expected. 26 The temperature dependence of the NE parameters is mostly captured by the increase of parameter E 0, NE , 1 and γ U NE , 1 e − 1 . Moreover, it is worth noting that parameter Δ x NE , 2 increases with temperature, while parameter Δ x NE , 3 decreases. This indicates a shift in the utilization of the capacity ranges associated with parameters Δ x NE , 2 and Δ x NE , 3 .

Solid lines indicate parameters estimated for the OCV during charge and broken lines during discharge. γUie− 1 was calculated by interpolating the numerically derived correlation between parameter ai and γUie− 1, as demonstrated in Figure 4b. Most of the estimated parameters show little dependence on temperature and hysteresis, which indicates scope for simplification of the temperature and hysteresis dependence of the individual parameters.
from Soup: 30 Hysteresis effects are very limited for the PE, as already observed from the raw OCV data. Most of the hysteresis is attributed to low levels of lithiation in the PE, as indicated by parameter Δ x PE , 1 , which is larger for OCV recorded during incremental charge, than discharge (see Figure 12 ). More pronounced effects can be observed for the NE, most notably reflected by higher values of parameter E 0, NE , 1 during incremental discharge compared to charge. 24 , 27 Further slight hysteresis dependence can be observed for parameter γ U NE , 1 e − 1 and for parameters Δ x NE , 2 and Δ x NE , 3 . The latter show a shift in capacity utilization between parameters Δ x NE , 2 andΔ x NE , 3 , with parameter Δ x NE , 2 being notably smaller during charge than during discharge, while the opposite is the case for parameter Δ x NE , 3 .
