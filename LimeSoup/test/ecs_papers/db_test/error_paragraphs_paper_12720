from test: 1 Technologically important metals and alloys such as aluminum (Al), stainless steels, and nickel-based alloys exhibit corrosion resistance in a wide range of environments due to the presence of protective, passive oxides.1–90 The passive oxides behave as kinetic barriers, which inhibit further oxidation of the underlying thermodynamically reactive metals. However, in environments that contain aggressive anions such as chloride, Cl−, the passive film becomes unstable and degrades locally causing film breakdown and localized corrosion,1–95 which in turn decreases the service life of the materials. The consequence of discrete oxide failure is localized corrosion, which occurs in the forms of crevice corrosion in occluded sites and metastable or stable pitting corrosion on open surfaces. It is generally agreed that localized corrosion occurs in two distinct steps: initiation and propagation.

from test: 3 The first step in the initiation of metastable or stable pitting corrosion of Al, as described in the prevailing mechanisms, is the adsorption of Cl− on the surface of the passive oxide on Al. Chloride adsorption by the oxide film has been primarily discussed in terms of surface attractive forces.3,14,25,29,41,53,74,99 The surface composition at the oxide solution/interface is usually an oxyhydroxide type material, e.g. AlOOH.101,102 The isoelectric point (IEP) or pH of zero charge (pHpzc)14,25,29,41,74 of an oxide defines the surface charge character as a function of pH. The pHpzc of Al is ∼ 9 in aqueous solutions.14,25,29,41,74 Thus, at pH values less than 9, which is the case for most natural water systems, the surface charge of aluminum is positive and this leads to the attraction of negative ions such as Cl−. pHpzc values are generally determined from powder samples. However, McCafferty and Wightman,64 using contact angle measurements, demonstrated that the pHpzc of the air-formed oxide film on aluminum metal is 9.5. Thus, for Al metal, the surface will have a net positive charge and anions will be attracted to the surface in aqueous solutions with a pH less than 9.5. The presence of this attractive force allows Cl− to readily move to the oxide/solution interface, thereby providing ample opportunity for interaction with the passive film surface.

from test: 12 The earliest XPS studies showing Cl− uptake by oxide-covered Al were those of Augustynski and Painot.27,69 The test solutions were slightly different in the studies. In reference 69, the test solution was deaerated, 0.1 M NaCl. This is a Cl− concentration used in many of the other references discussed in this review. In their work, samples were held for 18 hours at selected potentials below the Epit prior to analysis. It was reported that Cl− was contained in the oxide film and that there was a single binding energy value (198.0 eV) for the 2p3/2 peak. The amount of Cl− increased from 3% to 12% (ratio of Cl− to Al3+ expressed as a percentage) as the potential increased from –1.2 Vsce (Eoc) to just below Epit (Epit −0.07 V). They argued that the values for Cl− were too high to be assigned to just surface adsorption and, therefore, Cl− must also be contained within the oxide film.

Samples were held for 24 hours at Eoc before being polarized for 1 hour at a selected potential in the passive region prior to the XPS analysis. The XPS analysis was performed using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. Figure 3 shows a series of XPS 2p spectra for Cl− on aluminum samples polarized at selected potentials below Epit. One criterion for peak fitting was the use of the minimum number of peaks that could be used to reasonably fit the data. Figure 3a shows the Cl− spectrum for Eoc conditions, –1.028 Vsce for 24 hrs. Curve fitting showed two peaks corresponding to a single 2p3/2 – 2p1/2 doublet. The binding energy of the 2p3/2 peak was 198.0 eV in agreement with the value cited by Augustynski.27 Figure 3b shows the Cl− spectrum for a sample that was polarized at –0.800 Vsce and was best fit with two sets of doublets. The first doublet, peaks 1 and 2, have binding energies that correspond to the doublet observed for Eoc conditions. Peaks 3 and 4 correspond to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks for a second doublet that arise from Cl− in a different chemical environment. Figure 3c shows the Cl− spectrum for a sample polarized at –0.750 Vsce. A very definitive shoulder can be seen on the low binding energy side of the main peak. This shoulder confirms both the presence of Cl− in two different chemical environments and the validity of fitting the raw data with two sets of doublets. Figure 3d shows the Cl− spectrum for a sample polarized at –0.700 Vsce. In this spectrum, there are two distinct peaks with a shoulder on the lower binding energy side of the most prominent peak. This spectrum clearly shows the presence of Cl− in two different chemical environments. Thus, two distinct sets of doublets for Cl− were observed for potentials above Eoc43 with the average binding energy values for the 2p3/2 peaks being 197.9 eV and 199.8 eV.

Samples were held in solution for 45 minutes at Eoc before analysis. The amount of Cl− detected on the surface at Eoc was shown to be a function of pH. The authors also note that the minimum Cl− concentration correlated well with the pHpzc of 9.5 determined by McCafferty and Wigthman.64 A more in depth analysis was performed for samples that were in a pH 4 solution. For this condition, deconvolution of the Cl− 2p peak showed two sets of doublets and therefore the presence of two chloride species. Kolics et al.76 also observe that the Cl− concentration significantly exceeds that of a monolayer. In order to verify this conclusion these authors utilize angle resolved XPS to show that different amounts of Cl− existed at different depths in the oxide film for samples that were in a pH 4 solution, Figure 6. The angle resolved data demonstrated that the Cl− distribution was not uniform in the oxide film. The Cl− was concentrated in the near surface region with 80% of the original signal coming from the lower binding energy species or near surface.

In order to verify this conclusion these authors utilize angle resolved XPS to show that different amounts of Cl − existed at different depths in the oxide film for samples that were in a pH 4 solution, Figure 6 . The angle resolved data demonstrated that the Cl − distribution was not uniform in the oxide film. The Cl − was concentrated in the near surface region with 80% of the original signal coming from the lower binding energy species or near surface.

from test: 17 Yu et al.67 examined Cl− uptake by oxide covered Al in deaerated 0.1 M NaCl at potentials below Epit using XPS and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). In the XANES experiments, a Lytle detector was utilized, which provides the simultaneous recording of electron yield and fluorescence data. Electron yield data provided information on the surface Cl− much like XPS. The samples were prepared by allowing each sample to reach a steady state Eoc value over a 12-hour period prior to their polarization to the specific testing potential where they were held for 1 hour.

from test: 18 In the XPS analysis, Yu et al.67 also identified two Cl− species and followed the effects of the potential on the concentration of the two species. The XANES analysis showed a discrete peak at ∼ 2832 eV which correlated well with surface/near surface Cl− species identified in the XPS analysis as the lower binding energy peak. These results corresponded with those of Natishan et al.43 A further electron yield peak observed at 2836 eV corresponded to the higher binding energy XPS peak predicted for Cl− within the Al oxide film. The intensity and structure of the two peaks change with potential as shown in Figure 7.

from test: 19 Plots of the XANES normalized electron yield intensities, at 2832 eV and XPS results for surface/near surface Cl− as a function of potential are shown in Figure 8.67 The surface Cl− increased between –0.950 and –0.850 Vsce followed by a sharp decrease at –0.800 Vsce for both the XPS and XANES data. This was followed by a steady increase as potentials increased to –0.700 Vsce. Figure 9 presents data for Cl− that was incorporated in the oxide film. XPS and XANES data showed a level or slightly decreasing Cl− concentration between –0.950 and –0.850 Vsce followed by a steady increase between –0.850 and –0.750 Vsce. The use of two distinctly separate techniques that show similar profiles is compelling evidence that Cl− is incorporated into the entirety of the oxide film and that the concentration changes with potential.

from test: 22 Abd Rabbo et al.47 examined Cl− interactions with anodized aluminum, 72.0 nm thick oxide films, using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The anodized Al (99.99% purity) samples were either at Eoc for 480 minutes in 1.0 M KCl, pH 7.0 or polarized at –0.240 Vsce in 1.0 M KCl, pH 6.0 for 2 minutes. In the latter case no information was provided as to time at Eoc. For samples immersed at Eoc for 8 hours, Cl− was found only at the oxide/solution interface as shown in Figure 11. The data for samples polarized above Epit at –0.240 Vsce for 1 to 2 minutes are shown in Figure 12. The authors suggested the data showed just two locations for the Cl−; one at the oxide/solution interface and the other at the oxide/metal interface and that no Cl− appeared in the oxide. However a close examination of the data in Figure 12 clearly shows a significant Cl− signal in the region between the peak signals, which can be attributed to Cl− between the two interfacial regions. The sensitivity of SIMS demonstrated in the data shown in Figure 11 unmistakably shows the ability to observe Cl− at a very low concentration, much lower than the 0.45 × 10−14 amp signal observed in Figure 12. Since the signal in Figure 12 between the two peaks is 2/3rds of the magnitude of the signal at the oxide solution interface and SIMS measures the number of ions directly, the number of ions is 2/3rds of those measured at the oxide/solution interface and that therefore there is a significant Cl− concentration inside the oxide film.

from test: 23 Wood and coworkers47,66 interpreted the data from SIMS analysis to suggest that Cl− was present only at the oxide/metal and oxide/solution interfaces after polarization above Epit proving the existence of preexisting flaws. However, as discussed above, it is clear that Cl− was contained in the oxide film. It could also be argued that if the mechanism for Cl− to reach the oxide/metal interface was by pores or preexisting flaws, then the data presented in Figure 11, which shows Cl− only at the oxide/solution interface, would also show Cl− in the oxide as well as at the oxide/metal interface. This would result because Cl− would be trapped in the preexisting flaws or pores during the 8-hour emersion at Eoc in the 1.0 M KCl solution and would be detected as being associated with the bulk. Thus, the assertion that the results showed the presence of preexisting flaws was not consistent with the data.

Since the late 1980's a theoretical code FEFF, an ab initio, self-consistent, real-space multiple scattering code for calculating XANES, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and local l-projected density of states (LDOS) for clusters of atoms, has been available for calculating theoretical spectra and this has greatly enhanced the analysis of XAS data.107–112 With the release of newer versions of the FEFF code, it has become possible to carry out reliable calculations of the entire XAS spectra including the XANES, EXAFS, and the LDOS for clusters of atoms. The LDOS provides a direct interpretation of the experimental XANES spectra and an interpretation of the electronic structures that can give rise to the structural details observed in the experimental data. This approach provides information on the nature of the interactions and reactions occurring in previously inaccessible situations like the surface interactions of aluminum oxide with Cl− ions under reaction conditions.

from test: 26 The FEFF 8.0 code was recently used to generate the XANES and LDOS for the Cl K-edge for different oxide models to simulate chloride ions in different oxygen positions of the passive aluminum oxide films.79 The LDOS spectrum was obtained from the theoretical quantum mechanical calculations carried out for each model. After the proper energy range was chosen, the spectrum for each model was compared with the experimental XANES data. This approach was applied to the data originally published by Yu et al.67 From this work, a set of four potentials –0.850, –0.800, –0.750, and –0.700 Vsce were selected for the quantum mechanical simulation studies of the XANES data. The XANES spectra for these four voltages are shown in Figure 7. These spectra show significant changes in the magnitudes of the chloride signals and each of these spectra indicate a very different interaction of Cl− with the surface oxide.

from test: 27 In order to simulate the Cl− attack and breakdown of the passive oxide film, models were constructed where chloride was substituted for oxygen in either an OH− or an O2− position. Details on the development of the model can be found in Reference 79. There are four basic positions of oxygen on the oxide surface that could potentially be attacked by a chloride ion. The positions for the two kinds of OH− surface sites are shown in Figure 13, where the elevated site is in the highest position while the recessed surface is in the next lower octahedron but would still be directly exposed to the chloride solution. The two O2− positions are the normal bridging position and the terminal position at the end of an octahedron that is not connected to another octahedron.

from test: 28 The XANES data recorded at –0.850 Vsce were compared to the theoretically calculated LDOS spectrum for four possible oxygen positions.79 The theoretical LDOS for Cl− in the recessed site was compared with the XANES data shown in Figure 14. Of the 4 possibilities, this simulation yielded the best fit of the calculated spectrum with the actual data. Thus, the OH− recessed surface site is the most likely point of the initial attack by the chloride ion based on the theoretically calculated LDOS spectrum. In addition to the good agreement between the experimental and model spectra, electron density studies by Hill113 indicate that the charge on the oxygen in the OH− position is only half the charge of the oxygen in the O2− position and this makes it more susceptible to Cl− attack. Also, these finding were consistent with recent findings by Bennour et al.56 that show chloride-containing Al hydroxide species.

from test: 29 When the potential was raised to –0.800 Vsce, there was only one adequate model that could provide a good fit and physical insight as well. In this model, there were two Cl− ions in close proximity to each other in the general vicinity of an OH− site. This calculation works for the OH− site in either the elevated surface site position or in the recessed surface site position. The Cl− ions are at a distance of ∼2.0 Å from the aluminum atom which is comparable to the shortest Al-Cl bond distance, 2.06 Å, in Al2Cl6.114 The Cl− ions are separated by ∼2.0 Å as shown in Figure 15. This same model was used in the theoretical calculations for both the recessed site and the elevated site. Since XAS is an averaging technique, the XANES spectrum is an average of the absorption behavior of all of the Cl− ions in the system; both recessed and elevated OH− sites can come under attack by the Cl− ions.

from test: 30 At a potential of –0.750 Vsce, a completely different type of spectrum was observed indicating that the chemistry occurring on the surface now was vastly different. The model developed for the simulation that best matched this experimental data showed a Cl− that has reached the metal surface, Figure 16. In this model a Cl− was placed in the position of an aluminum atom in a111 surface plane. The calculation resulted in a spectrum with a slightly broader peak but this could be due to the finite cluster size used to calculate the LDOS.115 Another contributing factor is the averaging of all the contributions of the Cl− ions in the vicinity. The magnitude of this peak also requires some comment. Because we are dealing with a metal surface in this case, the scattering of electrons in a metal is much stronger than in a molecular oxide structure and therefore a peak with a much larger magnitude would be expected. Calculations were also carried out for a Cl− ion at various heights above the aluminum lattice to simulate an absorbed chloride ion as well as slightly below the surface to simulate a chloride ion that had penetrated the metal surface. The best fit was achieved when a Cl− was substituted for a single aluminum atom in the lattice surface as shown in Figure 16. This is important as the model shows that Cl− reaches the oxide metal interface and interacts with the metal.

from test: 31 At the last potential, –0.700 Vsce, active metastable pitting of the aluminum surface has begun and the modeling of this situation did not result in any satisfying results because there are multiple locations and a larger number of Cl− ions in addition to a number of different corrosion products. However, when the results obtained from the models of –0.800 and –0.850 Vsce were summed together, a rather good fit was obtained and this is shown in Figure 17.

Wall et al.94 etched the ion-implanted Al for fixed times to change the concentration of Cl−. The influence of the etch time, which in turn affects the Cl− concentration, is shown in Figure 18. Each data point in the figure represents the average of 10 Epit values and the solution was 50 mM NaCl. Initially, Epit decreased with etch time and after 400 seconds begins to increase until Epit reaches the Epit of unimplanted Al. This latter result indicated that the implanted Cl− had been completely removed from the surface. Assuming a linear etch rate, the minimum Epit corresponded to the maximum in the Cl− concentration. The data showed that the higher the concentration of the implanted Cl−, the lower the value of Epit.

The electrolyte in this set of experiments was 50 mM K2SO4 instead of NaCl to avoid any influence of solution Cl− on the polarization behavior. Two significant effects from the implanted Cl− were observed. The first was an increase in the propensity for pit nucleation with fluence (concentration), and the second was a decrease in the passive current density as the Cl− concentration increased. Pitting was not observed in the control cases (unimplanted and Ar-implanted) or in the low fluence implants (1 × 1016 and 2 × 1016 ions cm−2).

from test: 36 Serna et al.92 examined the effect of the ion implantation dose on Epit. Samples were ion implanted at a number of fluences and energies. This work showed that Cl− was contained in the oxide film and that the concentration within the oxide film increased with increasing implantation dose for a given implant energy. The test solution was 50 mM K2SO4. The value of Epit decreased as the Cl− fluence increased. Serna et al.92 noted a logarithmic dependence of Epit on the Cl− fluence at a given energy and postulated that this relationship suggested a critical concentration effect. Wall et al.94 and Serna et al.92 demonstrated that Cl− introduced and residing in the oxide film prior to polarization impacted the value of Epit. This work was important in that it demonstrated that Cl− in the oxide caused oxide film breakdown. If the latter was not the case then Epit values would not be affected by the presence of Cl− or be dependent on the Cl− concentration in the oxide.

Wall et al. 94 and Serna et al. 92 demonstrated that Cl − introduced and residing in the oxide film prior to polarization impacted the value of E pit . This work was important in that it demonstrated that Cl − in the oxide caused oxide film breakdown. If the latter was not the case then E pit values would not be affected by the presence of Cl − or be dependent on the Cl − concentration in the oxide.

from test: 37 Section IV presents a convincing body of results that show that Cl− enters into the oxide film. The next question is how does it get into the oxide film? In addition to the prevailing mechanism of migration/transport from the oxide/metal interface to the oxide/solution; two other possibilities exist. They are: i) entrainment during oxide growth and ii) entrainment after a metastable pitting event. The next section examines these two mechanisms for Cl− incorporation into the oxide film.

from test: 38 The oxide thickness values determined by Yu et al.67 in deaerated 0.1 M NaCl (pH 5.8) as a function of potentials below Epit are shown in Figure 2. The oxide thickness values were 5.0 to 5.5 nm at potentials between –0.950 and –0.800 Vsce, indicating that the oxide film has grown an additional 1.0 to 1.5 nm in these experiments compared to the air formed oxide films, see Section II. The XANES and XPS results, Figure 9, show that the quantity of Cl− incorporated within the oxide remains unchanged between –0.950 and –0.850 Vsce. Yu et al.67 did not examine samples at Eoc. However, XPS work by Natishan et al.43 showed that there was no detectable amount of Cl− incorporated in the oxide film for samples exposed to deaerated 0.1 M NaCl solution at Eoc for 24 hours while surface Cl− was detected.43 It should be noted that Cl− concentrations were low at Eoc and it was not possible to distinguish between the incorporated vs. surface Cl− using the analysis parameters, i.e. minimum number of curves to provide a good fit, Figure 3a. The oxide thickness of 5.4 nm was determined for Eoc conditions while an Al sample polarized at –0.800 Vsce had an oxide thickness of 5.0 nm in agreement with Yu et al.67 While there was little or no change in oxide thickness from Eoc to –0.800 Vsce, there was Cl− incorporation into the oxide during the polarization.43 The Cl− concentration in the oxide film further increased in the sample polarized at –0.750 Vsce in comparison to the sample polarized at –0.800 Vsce, while the oxide thickness decreased to 3.9 nm at –0.750 Vsce. These results agree with the work of Yu et al.67 where both the XPS and XANES results, Figure 9, showed increased Cl− concentration within the oxide film even though the oxide film thickness was essentially constant or thinning, Figure 2.

from test: 42 As shown in Figure 9, the Cl− concentration within the oxide remained constant between –0.950 and –0.850 Vsce and increased between –0.800 Vsce and –0.750 Vsce, and then decreased at –0.700 Vsce. If the dominant mechanism for Cl− incorporation was due to Cl− entrainment during oxide repassivation following a metastable pitting event, then the Cl− concentration within the oxide would continually increase tracking the increase of metastable pitting events as the potential increased toward Epit. However, this is not observed. A complete rupture of a metastable pit cap would result in the loss of the Cl− contained in the pit cap. As such, the increase in metastable pitting activity with potential, in which a significant number of events results in the total rupture of pit caps, would lead to a loss of Cl−. The decrease in Cl− content seen at –0.700 Vsce in Figure 9 is not consistent with the idea that the increase in Cl− content within the oxide is the result of metastable pitting followed by Cl− incorporation during repassivation.

from test: 43 If the oxide that was formed after a metastable event was deficient in Cl− in comparison to the nascent oxide, then the decreased Cl− concentration observed at –0.700 Vsce would be related to loss of the Cl−-containing pit cap and pit solution during metastable pitting. Therefore, a mechanism whereby Cl− is entrained/incorporated into the film by metastable pitting is not consistent with the overall experimental results.

from test: 44 Brown and Mackintosh116 and Skeldon et al.96 ion implanted various halogen species of Cl, Br, and I as tracer species to study the movement of halide ions in Al oxide. The halides were implanted into the metal or into thin preformed anodic aluminum oxide films. The implanted samples were then anodized to form significantly thicker oxides than would be expected from a simple exposure to an aqueous electrolyte. Using Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, the positions of implanted species were determined in preformed oxide films and in oxide films formed after implantation. These comparisons showed that the implanted halide ions, Cl−, Br−, and I−, migrated inward, toward the oxide/metal interface, and it was further noted that the rate of halide migration was slower than those of O2−. The relative rate of migration of the halides decreased as the ionic size increased. Figure 19 illustrates the distribution of Cl− in an anodic film formed during polarization of samples that were ion implanted after pre-anodization of the aluminum substrate.96 The relative changes in distance are referenced to a xenon marker layer that is immobile during polarization. These experiments clearly demonstrated the migration of ionic species, the direction of which depends on their charge. Another consideration in these two studies was the possibility of the influence of radiation damage on the behavior of migrating ions.

from test: 45 A unique preparation technique was developed that utilized electropolishing of Al samples in a perchloric acid-ethanol bath.117 This process resulted in the formation of a “polishing film” containing Cl− confined to a well-defined region. This was followed by anodization in a pentaborate bath forming an immobile boron doped reference layer. Using SIMS, Shimizu et al.117 demonstrated that Cl− migrated toward the oxide/metal interface under an applied potential. The relative rates of migration of Cl− and O−2 in Shimizu et al.117 were similar to those obtained by Brown and Mackintosh116 and Skeldon et al.96 for ion implanted samples. Thus, it is concluded that radiation damage from ion implantation is a minor influence on the transport processes.

These are very dynamic conditions and far from the current densities seen in the passive region, which would typically be less than 1 × 10−6 A/cm2. Given that the oxide growth is static or quasi-static/very slow (see Figure 2), then a mobile species such as Cl− should, with time, reach the oxide/metal interface.

After an hour, a sufficiently concentrated NaCl solution was added to the deionized solution to obtain a 50 mM Cl− solution. In a matter of seconds, ipass decreased by an order of magnitude.

from test: 49 Martin et al.73 used impedance spectroscopy to study the characteristics of aluminum in deaerated 0.1 M NaCl solution at potentials below the pitting potential (–1.50 Vsce to –0.70 Vsce). Multiple capacitive (or pseudocapacitive) impedance features were identified and analyzed over this range of potentials. Higher frequency resistances were compared with surface analytical data and established a correlation between higher frequency impedances and the concentration of Cl− in the passive film. Equivalent circuit-derived capacitance values were also used to produce a Mott-Schottky plot, shown in Figure 21.73 The Mott-Schottkey plot suggests the passive film on Al behaves as an n-type semiconductor in the passive potential region (positive slope) with a flatband potential of –1.40 Vsce. It should also be noted that the flatband potential predicted by extrapolating the linear region on the Mott-Schottky plot coincides with the capacitance maximum determined in this work. The n-type semiconductor behavior suggests that the primary charge carriers in the passive film are oxygen vacancies.

from test: 50 The effect of Cl− incorporation into the passive film on the impedance data was determined by Martin et al.73 by referring to the X-ray fluorescence XANES data of Yu et al.67 The penetration depth of the 2.3 keV X-rays used in the XANES experiments permited determination of the Cl− present for the total thickness of the oxide. In order to obtain the Cl− concentration in the passive film, the total Cl− content must be divided by the oxide film thickness, also reproduced from the work of Yu et al.67 and shown in Figure 2. Normalizing the data to provide Cl− concentration in the passive film produced the relationship shown in Figure 22.73 These results showed an increasing amount of Cl− in the passive film with increasing potential. This leads to a decreasing conductivity of the passive film at potentials prior to Epit. Since the passive film on Al is an n-type semiconductor, Figure 21, the charge transport in the passive film can be attributed to oxygen vacancies. Incorporation of Cl− into oxygen vacancy sites in the film39 impedes the motion of these vacancies. This restricted oxygen vacancy motion results in a more resistive film, resulting in lower conductivity in the space charge layer. Hence, the resistivity of the film increased with increasing Cl− content up to –0.750 Vsce. Above –0.750 Vsce, the Cl− concentration decreased, the resistivity decreased, and metastable pitting increased significantly. The reader is reminded that Epit is –0.670 Vsce ± 20 mV. Pyun et al.119 also show that the passive current density and Epit decrease with increasing Cl− concentration. Thus, a major effect of Cl− in the passive oxide film is to increase the film resistance and decrease the passive current density.
