from test: 0 Electrochemical and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) methods have been used to study the combined influence of H2O2 and H2 on the oxidation of SIMFUEL (UO2) electrodes in 0.1 mol·dm−3 KCl (pH = 9.5) at 60°C. The SIMFUEL electrodes contain REIII (rare earth) ions at UIV lattice sites within the UO2 matrix. In both Ar-purged and H2/Ar-purged solutions the final corrosion potential values were dependent on [H2O2]; however, the XPS analyses showed no differences in the degree of oxidation of uranium, indicating no enduring effect of H2 on the oxidation of UO2 in H2O2– containing solutions. However, in H2/Ar-purged solutions the corrosion potential achieves considerably more positive transient values than in Ar-purged solutions before relaxing to the final value. A possible reason is that the UIV ⇄ UVI redox cycle induced by hydrogen peroxide oxidation and hydrogen reduction activates the UO2 surface, leading to a temporary enhancement of UO2 dissolution (as UO22+).

from test: 1 Experiments were conducted on SIMFUEL electrodes fabricated by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (Chalk River, Ontario). These electrodes are doped to simulate some of the effects of in–reactor burn-up.44,45 In the present experiments the degree of simulated burnup was 3 at% and the electrodes were fabricated without the noble metal (ɛ) particles commonly present in these materials.44,45 The microstructure of the SIMFUEL was typical of a CANDU fuel pellet with polygonal, equiaxed grains, 8–15 μm in size, a density ∼97% of theoretical, and a resistivity of 174 Ω·cm. The details of electrode preparation have been described elsewhere.46
from Soup: 1 The selected approach for the long-term management of used nuclear fuel in Canada is Adaptive Phased Management. 1 This approach includes centralized containment and the eventual permanent isolation of used fuel in a deep geologic repository. The repository concept for the disposal of nuclear waste, based on a multiple barrier approach is universally accepted. 2 – 4 Within this multiple barrier approach, the only absolute barrier is a corrosion-resistant metallic container. In Canada and many other countries it is proposed that this container be fabricated from carbon steel, or copper mechanically supported by a carbon steel liner or a steel or iron insert. While these containers are expected to provide containment of the waste for very long times, 5 – 7 the consequences of container failure on the fuel corrosion and radionuclide release processes are being assessed in considerable detail. 2 , 7 – 10

from test: 2 All solutions were prepared with distilled deionized water purified using a Millipore milli–Q–plus unit to remove organic and inorganic impurities, and subsequently passed through milli–Q–plus exchange columns. All experiments were conducted in a 0.1 mol·dm−3 KCl (Aldrich) solution saturated with Ar or 5%H2/Ar gas (Praxair). Solutions were purged for a minimum of one hour prior to starting the experiment, to minimize the levels of dissolved O2 in the electrolyte and throughout the experiment. The pH was adjusted to 9.5 using a 0.1 mol·dm−3 KOH solution, and an Orion Model 250A + pH meter and Orion 91–07 Triode pH/ATC probe. The temperature of the experiment was maintained at 60°C using a water circulating thermostatic bath to control the temperature to ±1°C. Stock solutions of H2O2 were prepared by dilution of a 3% W/V solution (Fisher Scientific) and cell concentrations in the range 10−9 to 10−11 mol·dm−3 achieved by adding 0.25 ml of this solution to the 400 ml cell solution volume.
from Soup: 2 Once groundwater enters the container, two distinct corrosion fronts will be established: one on the fuel surface driven by radiolytic oxidants (primarily H 2 O 2 from the alpha radiolysis of water), and a second on the iron/carbon steel surface, sustained by reaction with water to produce dissolved Fe 2+ and H 2 . Both of these steel corrosion products can potentially establish reducing conditions at the surface of the fuel by scavenging the radiolytic oxidants (primarily H 2 O 2 ). This scavenging will suppress fuel corrosion (UO 2 • UO 2 2+ + 2e − ) and, since the solubility of uranium is many orders of magnitude lower as U IV , than U VI (as UO 2 2+ ), 11 , 12 significantly retard the release of the radionuclides contained within the fuel. These potential scavenging reactions have been extensively studied, 13 – 25 and there is now a substantial database to demonstrate that H 2 has a much larger effect on fuel dissolution than Fe 2+ . These studies show that even relatively small amounts of dissolved H 2 can have a very major influence on fuel corrosion; 26 , 27 in addition, hydrogen pressures up to 5 MPa are expected to develop quickly within a failed container, 28 , 29 since the loss of H 2 by transport will be limited by the presence of clays compacted around the containers.

from test: 3 Experiments were performed in a standard three electrode, three compartment cell. The reference electrode was a commercial saturated calomel electrode (SCE) (Fisher Scientific) placed in a compartment separated from the main body of the cell by a glass frit. All potentials were measured with a commercial SCE (+242 mV and 216 mV against the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) at 25°C and 60°C, respectively); regardless of acquisition temperature, they are quoted against the usual 25°C SCE scale. The counter electrode was a Pt foil (99.5% pure, Goodfellow), with a surface area of 13 cm2, spot–welded to a Pt wire. The cell was fitted with a glass jacket to allow temperature control. The cell was housed in a grounded Faraday cage to minimize external sources of noise. A Solartron Model 1287 potentiostat was used to control applied potentials and record current responses. Corrware software (Scribner Associates) was used to control instrumentation, and to record and analyze data.
from Soup: 3 Studies on the influence of H 2 on a range of used fuels, alpha-doped UO 2 , simulated spent fuels, and undoped UO 2 specimens have been recently reviewed. 10 , 26 The primary reductant leading to the protection of fuel against corrosion is the H • radical, which can be produced by a number of activation reactions, depending on the composition of the fuel and the presence and nature of the radiation fields. Potential activation mechanisms include the following:
 ###### 
from test: 4 An SSX Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA) spectrometer was used to record all XPS spectra. Spectra were excited using Al Kα monochromatic radiation to bombard the surface with high energy monochromatic X–rays (hν = 1486.6 eV). The instrument work function was set to give a value of 84.00 ± 0.05 eV for the binding energy of the Au(4f7/2) line of metallic Au. The spectrometer was calibrated to give an energy difference between the Cu (2p3/2) and Cu (3p) lines of 875.5 ± 0.1 eV. The position of the C (1s) line at 285.0 eV was recorded and used to correct for minor variations in surface charging between samples. Spectra were collected using 150 eV analyzer pass energy and a 600 μm X−ray spot size for the broad scans. For the narrow (high resolution) scans, an analyzer pass energy of 50 eV and a 600 μm X-ray spot size were used. All binding energies reported have an error of ±0.2 eV.
from Soup: 4 (i) A combination of γ-radiation and H 2 can produce H • radicals. This may involve the adsorption of gamma energy in the UO 2 surface to produce high energy excitons which can decompose water into OH • and H • surface radical species. 30 Scavenging of highly reactive OH • by H 2 can then produce an additional H • radical: which would then further scavenge radiolytic oxidants (to reform H 2 O) and suppress fuel corrosion. This mechanism requires that the oxide band gap be sufficiently large (>5 eV) that these excitons possess sufficient energy to break H–O–H bonds (5.1 eV). In the reduced state, when the U5f level is fully occupied, UO 2 possesses the required 5 eV band gap. 31
 ###### 
from test: 5 The U4f(7/2) and O(1s) peaks and associated satellites, and the valence band region of the UO2 spectra, were recorded. The U4f(7/2) peak was resolved into contributions from UIV, UV, and UVI, and the positions of the satellites and the behavior in the valence band region used to check the validity of the fit.47,48 A detailed description of our analytical and spectral fitting procedure has been published elsewhere.46
from Soup: 5 (ii) Similar inhibition and scavenging processes are possible when only α–radiation fields are present, as would be the case for spent fuel after a few hundred to a thousand years when γ/β radiation fields will have decayed to insignificant levels. 10 A possible mechanism is via α-particle emission which will produce surface defects by the preferential ejection of O atoms leading to the creation of reduced U III surface states. A subsequent reoxidation of the surface by H 2 O, leading to the reincorporation of O 2− would yield a proton and a H • radical able to scavenge radiolytic oxidants,
 ###### 
from test: 6 Figure 1 shows a series of corrosion potential (ECORR) measurements performed in solutions purged with either Ar (Figure 1a) or 5%H2/95% Ar (H2/Ar) (Figure 1b) and followed by either cathodic stripping voltammetry (CSV, a, b) or XPS analyses (c, d). In these experiments, ECORR was allowed to achieve a steady–state value at which point H2O2 was added. The time of addition of H2O2 in any individual experiments is indicated by a vertical arrow. As may be expected, ECORR values achieved prior to H2O2 addition were the same, within the range of experimental reproducibility, in both purge gases, since H2 has previously been shown to have no influence on ECORR measured on these electrodes.34
from Soup: 6 (iii) In the absence of radiation fields, experiments on SIMFUELS containing noble metal (ɛ) particles, which would be formed via in–reactor fission in fuel, 32 , 33 show that H 2 activation occurs rapidly on these particles. 34 Since these particles are galvanically coupled to the rare earth–doped (and, hence, conducting) UO 2 matrix (RE x III U x V O 2 ), they act as anodes, which force the matrix to adopt a low potential. For either a sufficiently high number density of particles at low [H 2 ] or a sufficiently high [H 2 ] at a low number density of particles, this galvanic coupling could render the UO 2 unreactive.
 ###### 
from test: 7 Irrespective of the composition of the purge gas, the addition of H2O2 lead to a rapid increase of ECORR; in general, the magnitude of this response increased with increasing amounts of H2O2, although there is considerable experimental uncertainty in the absolute values. The observed change in ECORR was consistent with the rapid response of ECORR to H2O2 additions that have been previously observed on both non-rare-earth–doped UO2 electrodes39 and on SIMFUEL electrodes containing ɛ particles.36 When Ar was used as the purge gas in our experiments, ECORR eventually achieved a new, more positive steady-state value. The steady-state values prior to, and after, H2O2 addition are shown in Figure 2. The influence of [H2O2] on ECORR was clear, especially at the higher added concentrations, which showed the greatest response. In H2/Ar–purged solutions, the final steady-state ECORR values were very similar to those recorded in the absence of H2; however, the transient response (i.e., maximum ECORR observed) was considerably larger. With the exception of one experiment ([H2O2] = 10−10 mol· dm−3, Figure 1), ECORR in Ar–purged solutions rose steadily to the final steady-state value. By contrast, in H2/Ar–purged solutions, ECORR achieved considerably more positive values before relaxing to the final values (In some cases, steady-state has not been achieved at the conclusion of the experiment).
from Soup: 7 Recently, it was demonstrated that in the presence of these noble metal particles, H 2 could prevent, or reverse, the oxidation of UO 2 by H 2 O 2 . 35 , 36 These particles have been shown to accelerate UO 2 oxidation by catalyzing H 2 O 2 reduction, 37 , 38
 ###### 
from test: 8 The CSVs recorded after open circuit exposure to each purge gas are shown in Figure 3 for a [H2O2] of 10−10 mol·dm−3. At this concentration, no significant current for H2O2 reduction was observed. The observed currents, prior to the steep H2O reduction currents at E < −1.1 V, can be attributed to the reduction of either the natural UV content of the SIMFUEL (present as a consequence of the REIII dopants), or of this content plus the oxidized surface layers formed by reaction with the added H2O2. Figure 3 shows no significant difference between the CSVs recorded after exposure to the two purge gases, indicating no discernible difference in the extent of oxidation of the UO2 surface. Quantitatively, by integrating the cathodic current between the potential limits of −0.4 V and −0.9 V, the amount of charge required to reduce the surface was estimated. This charge will be equal to the amount required to reduce the layers oxidized by H2O2, plus that due to reduction of UV in the rare earth-doped unperturbed matrix. Since the latter charge will be the same in all cases no attempt to correct for it has been made when calculating these charges.
from Soup: 8 In the absence of H 2 , the OH • radical could then oxidize a second U IV surface atom or further oxidize the U V surface species to the more soluble U VI state (as UO 2+ 1 ). 11 , 12 The production of OH • radicals in this oxidation process then offers a possible route by which H 2 could prevent/reverse the oxidation process by scavenging these radicals on the noble metal particles to release an electron which then reduces the U V surface states,
 ###### 
from test: 9 Figure 4a and f4b plots values of this charge calculation (QH2O2) as a function of the concentration of added H2O2 (Figure 4a) and as a function of the final ECORR value achieved (Figure 4b). As can be observed in these figures, as [H2O2] (and the corresponding ECORR values) increased, the calculated charge from the reduction process increased. However, given the limited accuracy of the integration and the small values of total charge involved (<1.5 mC in all cases for the combined reduction processes), these plots show no significant differences between Ar and H2/Ar-purged solutions. This would either suggest that the extent of oxidation of the UO2 surface was uninfluenced by the presence of H2, or that if this technique is not sensitive enough to measure a difference between these two conditions, the difference was insignificant enough to ignore.
from Soup: 9 There is also published evidence that UO 2 corrosion is rapidly driven by H 2 O 2 reduction directly on the UO 2 surface. 39 – 42 While H 2 O 2 reduction on UO 2 is likely to be kinetically slower than on noble metal particles, the low number density and small size of these particles, makes the direct pathway on UO 2 kinetically important. It has also been claimed that reaction ( 3 ) can also occur directly on the UO 2 surface to suppress UO 2 oxidation and corrosion. 43 In this paper, the feasibility of this last reaction using rare-earth doped UO 2 specimens which do not contain noble metal particles was investigated.
 ###### 
from test: 10 Figure 5 shows the fractions of UIV, UV, and UVI as a function of [H2O2] after the ECORR measurements in Ar- (Figure 5a) and H2/Ar-purged (Figure 5b) solutions. The horizontal dotted lines show the amounts of these three U oxidation states measured on the electrode surfaces after open circuit exposure to the two purge gases in the absence of H2O2.35,39 The slight differences in these calibration lines are reflective of the minor differences in ECORR measured; hence, the extents of surface oxidation between the two purge gases slightly differed. However, in comparison to the differences observed when measurements were made on SIMFUEL electrodes containing ɛ—particles,35,39 these differences were negligible.

 ###### 
from test: 11 The influence of increasing the [H2O2] on the extent of oxidation of the surface was clear; in both cases, the UIV surface content decreased as the UV and UVI contents increased. Comparison of the two plots shows no significant differences in surface composition as an effect of purge gas for Ar- and H2/Ar- containing systems. At the lowest [H2O2] employed (10−11 mol dm−3) the UIV content was higher (and the UV and UVI contents correspondingly lower) on the electrode surface exposed to the H2/Ar–purged solution, but the difference was well within the margin of error in the measurements. This was in contrast to the behavior observed on SIMFUEL electrodes containing ɛ—particles, when the surfaces exposed to H2/Ar—purged solutions were significantly less oxidized than those exposed to Ar—purged solutions.

from test: 12 Figure 6 summarizes the oxidation state data obtained from XPS as a function of the final steady-state ECORR value and compares them to the surface compositions that would be expected based solely on electrochemical oxidation of the surface at the potentials within the range plotted.49 Previously, it was demonstrated that the compositions obtained under corrosion conditions in the presence of Ar-, H2/Ar-, or O2-purged gases followed the electrochemical calibration curves closely.49 Figure 8 shows this was the case in the present experiments, the differences in behavior being too small to claim any significant influence of H2.

 ###### 
from test: 13 Based on these results there was no evidence to indicate any enduring influence of H2 on the oxidation state of UO2 when it was concurrently exposed to H2O2. However, when H2 was present, considerably more positive potentials were observed prior to the relaxation to the final steady-state, with ECORR in some cases rising to >100 mV. At these potentials, our previous electrochemical results indicate that substantial oxidation of the surface to the UVI state, leading to UO22+ dissolution, should occur.39 These very positive ECORR values combined with the observed eventual relaxation in ECORR suggested that the redox cycle observed on noble metal particles (reactions 3 to 6) did occur on the UO2 surface. In this system, any reduced UIV states produced by reaction 6 may be considerably more reactive than they were in the original matrix. Whether or not this sequence of reactions was accompanied by further oxidation to the UVI state has not been confirmed by the present study.

 ###### 
from test: 15 In both Ar- and H2/Ar-purged solutions the final ECORR values were dependent on the [H2O2] and the XPS analyses showed no differences in the degree of oxidation as a function of purge gas, indicating no enduring effect of H2 on the oxidation of UO2 by H2O2.
from Soup: 15 Figure 1 shows a series of corrosion potential (E CORR ) measurements performed in solutions purged with either Ar (Figure 1a ) or 5%H 2 /95% Ar (H 2 /Ar) (Figure 1b ) and followed by either cathodic stripping voltammetry (CSV, a, b) or XPS analyses (c, d).

 ###### 
from test: 16 Different transitory behavior in ECORR was observed depending on the composition of the purge gas. In Ar-purged solutions ECORR increased monotonically to a new steady-state value. In H2/Ar-purged solutions, ECORR rose to much more positive values than in the Ar-only condition, prior to relaxing to a final value that was similar to the Ar-only condition.
from Soup: 16 Irrespective of the composition of the purge gas, the addition of H 2 O 2 lead to a rapid increase of E CORR ; in general, the magnitude of this response increased with increasing amounts of H 2 O 2 , although there is considerable experimental uncertainty in the absolute values. The observed change in E CORR was consistent with the rapid response of E CORR to H 2 O 2 additions that have been previously observed on both non-rare-earth–doped UO 2 electrodes 39 and on SIMFUEL electrodes containing ɛ particles. 36 When Ar was used as the purge gas in our experiments, E CORR eventually achieved a new, more positive steady-state value. The steady-state values prior to, and after, H 2 O 2 addition are shown in Figure 2 . The influence of [H 2 O 2 ] on E CORR was clear, especially at the higher added concentrations, which showed the greatest response. In H 2 /Ar–purged solutions, the final steady-state E CORR values were very similar to those recorded in the absence of H 2 ; however, the transient response (i.e., maximum E CORR observed) was considerably larger. With the exception of one experiment ([H 2 O 2 ] = 10 −10 mol· dm −3 , Figure 1 ), E CORR in Ar–purged solutions rose steadily to the final steady-state value. By contrast, in H 2 /Ar–purged solutions, E CORR achieved considerably more positive values before relaxing to the final values (In some cases, steady-state has not been achieved at the conclusion of the experiment).
 ###### 
from test: 17 The above results suggest that the UO2 surface is activated by the UIV → UV redox cycle induced by peroxide oxidation and hydrogen reduction.
from Soup: 17 The CSVs recorded after open circuit exposure to each purge gas are shown in Figure 3 for a [H 2 O 2 ] of 10 −10 mol·dm −3 . At this concentration, no significant current for H 2 O 2 reduction was observed. The observed currents, prior to the steep H 2 O reduction currents at E < −1.1 V, can be attributed to the reduction of either the natural U V content of the SIMFUEL (present as a consequence of the RE III dopants), or of this content plus the oxidized surface layers formed by reaction with the added H 2 O 2 . Figure 3 shows no significant difference between the CSVs recorded after exposure to the two purge gases, indicating no discernible difference in the extent of oxidation of the UO 2 surface. Quantitatively, by integrating the cathodic current between the potential limits of −0.4 V and −0.9 V, the amount of charge required to reduce the surface was estimated. This charge will be equal to the amount required to reduce the layers oxidized by H 2 O 2 , plus that due to reduction of U V in the rare earth-doped unperturbed matrix. Since the latter charge will be the same in all cases no attempt to correct for it has been made when calculating these charges.
 ###### 
from test: 18 The transitory values of ECORR are sufficiently positive that significant dissolution (as UO22+) could have occurred, but this has not been confirmed.
from Soup: 18 Figure 4a and f4b plots values of this charge calculation (Q H 2 O 2 ) as a function of the concentration of added H 2 O 2 (Figure 4a ) and as a function of the final E CORR value achieved (Figure 4b ). As can be observed in these figures, as [H 2 O 2 ] (and the corresponding E CORR values) increased, the calculated charge from the reduction process increased. However, given the limited accuracy of the integration and the small values of total charge involved (<1.5 mC in all cases for the combined reduction processes), these plots show no significant differences between Ar and H 2 /Ar-purged solutions. This would either suggest that the extent of oxidation of the UO 2 surface was uninfluenced by the presence of H 2 , or that if this technique is not sensitive enough to measure a difference between these two conditions, the difference was insignificant enough to ignore.

In Canada and many other countries it is proposed that this container be fabricated from carbon steel, or copper mechanically supported by a carbon steel liner or a steel or iron insert.

from Soup: 20 The influence of increasing the [H 2 O 2 ] on the extent of oxidation of the surface was clear; in both cases, the U IV surface content decreased as the U V and U VI contents increased. Comparison of the two plots shows no significant differences in surface composition as an effect of purge gas for Ar- and H 2 /Ar- containing systems. At the lowest [H 2 O 2 ] employed (10 −11 mol dm −3 ) the U IV content was higher (and the U V and U VI contents correspondingly lower) on the electrode surface exposed to the H 2 /Ar–purged solution, but the difference was well within the margin of error in the measurements. This was in contrast to the behavior observed on SIMFUEL electrodes containing ɛ—particles, when the surfaces exposed to H 2 /Ar—purged solutions were significantly less oxidized than those exposed to Ar—purged solutions.
 ###### 
from test: 21 Once groundwater enters the container, two distinct corrosion fronts will be established: one on the fuel surface driven by radiolytic oxidants (primarily H2O2 from the alpha radiolysis of water), and a second on the iron/carbon steel surface, sustained by reaction with water to produce dissolved Fe2+ and H2. Both of these steel corrosion products can potentially establish reducing conditions at the surface of the fuel by scavenging the radiolytic oxidants (primarily H2O2). This scavenging will suppress fuel corrosion (UO2 • UO22+ + 2e−) and, since the solubility of uranium is many orders of magnitude lower as UIV, than UVI (as UO22+),11,12 significantly retard the release of the radionuclides contained within the fuel. These potential scavenging reactions have been extensively studied,13–25 and there is now a substantial database to demonstrate that H2 has a much larger effect on fuel dissolution than Fe2+. These studies show that even relatively small amounts of dissolved H2 can have a very major influence on fuel corrosion;26,27 in addition, hydrogen pressures up to 5 MPa are expected to develop quickly within a failed container,28,29 since the loss of H2 by transport will be limited by the presence of clays compacted around the containers.
from Soup: 21 Figure 6 summarizes the oxidation state data obtained from XPS as a function of the final steady-state E CORR value and compares them to the surface compositions that would be expected based solely on electrochemical oxidation of the surface at the potentials within the range plotted. 49 Previously, it was demonstrated that the compositions obtained under corrosion conditions in the presence of Ar-, H 2 /Ar-, or O 2 -purged gases followed the electrochemical calibration curves closely. 49 Figure 8 shows this was the case in the present experiments, the differences in behavior being too small to claim any significant influence of H 2 .

from test: 22 Studies on the influence of H2 on a range of used fuels, alpha-doped UO2, simulated spent fuels, and undoped UO2 specimens have been recently reviewed.10,26 The primary reductant leading to the protection of fuel against corrosion is the H• radical, which can be produced by a number of activation reactions, depending on the composition of the fuel and the presence and nature of the radiation fields. Potential activation mechanisms include the following:
from Soup: 22 Based on these results there was no evidence to indicate any enduring influence of H 2 on the oxidation state of UO 2 when it was concurrently exposed to H 2 O 2 . However, when H 2 was present, considerably more positive potentials were observed prior to the relaxation to the final steady-state, with E CORR in some cases rising to >100 mV. At these potentials, our previous electrochemical results indicate that substantial oxidation of the surface to the U VI state, leading to UO 2 2+ dissolution, should occur. 39 These very positive E CORR values combined with the observed eventual relaxation in E CORR suggested that the redox cycle observed on noble metal particles (reactions 3 to 6 ) did occur on the UO 2 surface. In this system, any reduced U IV states produced by reaction 6 may be considerably more reactive than they were in the original matrix. Whether or not this sequence of reactions was accompanied by further oxidation to the U VI state has not been confirmed by the present study.

from test: 23 (i) A combination of γ-radiation and H2 can produce H• radicals. This may involve the adsorption of gamma energy in the UO2 surface to produce high energy excitons which can decompose water into OH• and H• surface radical species.30 Scavenging of highly reactive OH• by H2 can then produce an additional H• radical:
from Soup: 23 The combined influence of H 2 O 2 and dissolved H 2 on the oxidation of UO 2 has been studied using SIMFUEL electrodes. These electrodes were rare-earth doped, and hence conductive, but did not contain any noble metal particles.

from test: 24 which would then further scavenge radiolytic oxidants (to reform H2O) and suppress fuel corrosion. This mechanism requires that the oxide band gap be sufficiently large (>5 eV) that these excitons possess sufficient energy to break H–O–H bonds (5.1 eV). In the reduced state, when the U5f level is fully occupied, UO2 possesses the required 5 eV band gap.31
from Soup: 24 In both Ar- and H 2 /Ar-purged solutions the final E CORR values were dependent on the [H 2 O 2 ] and the XPS analyses showed no differences in the degree of oxidation as a function of purge gas, indicating no enduring effect of H 2 on the oxidation of UO 2 by H 2 O 2 .
 ###### 
from test: 25 (ii) Similar inhibition and scavenging processes are possible when only α–radiation fields are present, as would be the case for spent fuel after a few hundred to a thousand years when γ/β radiation fields will have decayed to insignificant levels.10 A possible mechanism is via α-particle emission which will produce surface defects by the preferential ejection of O atoms leading to the creation of reduced UIII surface states. A subsequent reoxidation of the surface by H2O, leading to the reincorporation of O2− would yield a proton and a H• radical able to scavenge radiolytic oxidants,
from Soup: 25 Different transitory behavior in E CORR was observed depending on the composition of the purge gas. In Ar-purged solutions E CORR increased monotonically to a new steady-state value. In H 2 /Ar-purged solutions, E CORR rose to much more positive values than in the Ar-only condition, prior to relaxing to a final value that was similar to the Ar-only condition.
 ###### 
from test: 26 (iii) In the absence of radiation fields, experiments on SIMFUELS containing noble metal (ɛ) particles, which would be formed via in–reactor fission in fuel,32,33 show that H2 activation occurs rapidly on these particles.34 Since these particles are galvanically coupled to the rare earth–doped (and, hence, conducting) UO2 matrix (RExIIIUxVO2), they act as anodes, which force the matrix to adopt a low potential. For either a sufficiently high number density of particles at low [H2] or a sufficiently high [H2] at a low number density of particles, this galvanic coupling could render the UO2 unreactive.
from Soup: 26 The above results suggest that the UO 2 surface is activated by the U IV → U V redox cycle induced by peroxide oxidation and hydrogen reduction.
 ###### 
from test: 27 Recently, it was demonstrated that in the presence of these noble metal particles, H2 could prevent, or reverse, the oxidation of UO2 by H2O2.35,36 These particles have been shown to accelerate UO2 oxidation by catalyzing H2O2 reduction,37,38
from Soup: 27 The transitory values of E CORR are sufficiently positive that significant dissolution (as UO 2 2+ ) could have occurred, but this has not been confirmed.
 ###### 
from test: 28 In the absence of H2, the OH• radical could then oxidize a second UIV surface atom or further oxidize the UV surface species to the more soluble UVI state (as UO2+1).11,12 The production of OH• radicals in this oxidation process then offers a possible route by which H2 could prevent/reverse the oxidation process by scavenging these radicals on the noble metal particles to release an electron which then reduces the UV surface states,

from test: 29 There is also published evidence that UO2 corrosion is rapidly driven by H2O2 reduction directly on the UO2 surface.39–42 While H2O2 reduction on UO2 is likely to be kinetically slower than on noble metal particles, the low number density and small size of these particles, makes the direct pathway on UO2 kinetically important. It has also been claimed that reaction (3) can also occur directly on the UO2 surface to suppress UO2 oxidation and corrosion.43 In this paper, the feasibility of this last reaction using rare-earth doped UO2 specimens which do not contain noble metal particles was investigated.
