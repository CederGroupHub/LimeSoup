0 Cathodic processes during the electrodeoxidation of solid Nb2O5 in thermally dried and pre-electrolyzed molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic were studied at temperatures 850-950°C using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry, respectively. In cyclic voltammograms at 850-950°C, several reduction peaks were clearly observed at the potentials at least 0.8 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) less cathodic than those of the metals deposition from the eutectic melt, confirming the concept of cathodic oxygen ionization. The chronoamperometric studies showed that the cathodic processes at the potentials of 0.7-0.2 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) always started with the oxygen ionization of the CaNb2O6 film on the surface of the Nb2O5 electrode in the molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic electrolyte, which was governed by the oxygen diffusion within the film toward the CaNb2O6 -electrolyte interface. The subsequent oxygen ionization of the oxides at the surface took place consecutively and/or simultaneously. Surface characterizations of the Nb2O5 electrodes before and after the chronoamperometric measurements revealed that there existed a marked dependence of the morphologies, compositions, and phases on the imposed potential steps and that the calcium cations were intercalated electrochemically into the Nb2O5 structure at the surface at relatively less cathodic potentials than that of the sodium deposition from the molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic.

2 A three-electrode electrochemical cell was used for all the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) experiments in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic in this work. For the electrochemical study of a CaCl2-NaCl eutectic melt, a molybdenum wire (0.5-mm diameter and about 10-mm immersed depth) was used as the working electrode because it was chemically inert in the molten salts and also not attacked by either molten sodium or calcium at elevated temperatures. A glassy carbon rod (5-mm diameter and 20-mm depth) was employed as the counterelectrode, and a molybdenum wire (1-mm diameter) or a stainless steel crucible (60-mm i.d.) functioned as the pseudoreference electrode. In the case of the electrochemical studies of electrodeoxidation of solid Nb2O5 in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic, the pellets of Nb2O5 were compacted from the as-received Nb2O5 powder under a compaction load of 2.55×107kg∕m2 and were then sintered at 1400°C for 4 h. The dimension of the sintered pellets was typically 5-mm length, 5-mm width, and 1.5-mm thickness, with an external surface area of approximately 0.8cm2 . Each pellet of Nb2O5 was wound equally about two times by the molybdenum wire, 0.5-mm diameter, and was used as the working electrode. The high-density graphite rods were used as the counterelectrodes. The stainless steel crucible was used for holding the electrolyte (typically 450 g) and also acted as the pseudoreference electrode, the potential of which was frequently checked against the potentials (open circuit potentials) of a newly dipped molybdenum wire (1-mm diameter) and of the cathodic deposition of the Na-Ca alloy on the molybdenum wire at a given temperature. The nickel wire was used as the electrical lead for the stainless steel crucible. The Kanthal wire was the electrical lead for the high-density graphite rod or glassy carbon rod. The electrolyte temperature was measured using a type K thermocouple in an alumina sheath by dipping it into the molten salt electrolyte and the thermocouple was removed from the cell prior to the electrochemical measurements. The cell was placed in a vertical Inconel reactor tube closed at one end.

3 The cells were gastight so that the electrochemical measurements could be made under dry high-purity argon at a slightly positive pressure. Each cell was then flushed with the argon while it was heated to the required temperatures. When the cell reached the temperature of 900°C, the pre-electrolysis was performed at a constant voltage of 2.8-3.0 V for about 12 h. The pre-electrolysis was used to remove the moisture and metallic impurities from the electrolyte and to decompose traces of oxides and other compounds such as CaOHCl, which are thermodynamically less stable than the eutectic melt of NaCl and CaCl2 . The working electrode, either a molybdenum wire or a molybdenum-wire-wound Nb2O5 pellet, was placed a few millimeters away from the reference electrode (molybdenum wire or stainless steel crucible). All resistances between the working electrode and the reference electrode were measured by the ac impedance method using a Solartron 1260 frequency response analyzer, which include the total circuit resistance (i.e., contact resistance and long electrode lead resistance) and the electrolyte resistance. The electrochemical measurements were made in the temperature range of 685-950°C by means of the Solartron 1287 electrochemical interface powerstat.

4 A eutectic melt of CaCl2-NaCl was selected as the electrolyte in this work. CaCl2 was chosen due to its several desirable properties: very high solubility for O2− (e.g., 20 mol % CaO in CaCl2 at 900°C), 34 extremely high solubility of CaCl2 in water ( 1.59g∕mL of H2O ), low cost, very low toxicity, and ready availability. The solubility of niobium oxides in a pure CaCl2 melt is negligible at temperatures between 600 and 950°C. It is, however, increased substantially in the presence of CaO. An addition of NaCl to the CaCl2 melt can lower the liquidus temperature and increase the electrical conductivities of the electrolyte; importantly, it can reduce the CaO solubility and prevent niobium oxides from dissolving chemically into the melt in the case of the CaO-dissolved CaCl2 melts. 14 , 35

5 The variations of theoretical decomposition potentials of the pure salts, niobium oxides, and calcium niobate present in the system with temperature are illustrated in Fig. 1 , with those for CaO also included in the figure for comparison. 36 Figure 1 shows that the decomposition potentials for the pure NaCl and CaCl2 are at least 1.38 V greater than those of the pure Nb2O5,NbO2 , NbO, and CaNb2O6 , implying that these oxides may be ionized at less cathodic potentials than those for decomposing either pure NaCl or CaCl2 . The decomposition potentials for the CaO are higher than those for any of the niobium oxides. This ensures that, thermodynamically, there is no chance for the partially reduced niobium oxides to be reoxidized by the CaO dissolved in the melt in contact with the niobium oxides. Furthermore, it can be found from Fig. 1 that the electrochemical reduction of solid Nb2O5 should be stepwise, i.e., Nb2O5→NbO2→NbO→Nb , because of the multivalent property of niobium. For the CaCl2-NaCl melt, the effect of the solution must be taken into account. The activities of NaCl in the CaCl2-NaCl system were reported to show negative deviations from Raoult’s law over the entire compositional range at 825 and 850°C, respectively, and the temperature had little influence on the values of the NaCl activities near the eutectic composition. 37 , 38 The theoretical decomposition potentials of NaCl in the eutectic melt are, therefore, higher than those of pure NaCl at 850-950°C. Furthermore, cathodic deposition of sodium or calcium from pure NaCl or CaCl2 and their electrode potentials (E) calculated from thermodynamic data (ECa2+∕Ca=0) at 850, 900, and 950°C are given, respectively, in Table I . 36 This table demonstrates that sodium can be deposited from pure NaCl at the potentials at least 38 mV more positive than that for calcium deposition from pure CaCl2 at temperatures between 850 and 950°C. The results in Table I also predict that sodium should be cathodically deposited from molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic prior to codeposition of Na-Ca alloys and that the deposition potentials of the Na-Ca alloys should be less cathodic than those of pure calcium as the activities of calcium in the alloys are less than unity.

6 The electrochemistry of molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic was also studied experimentally by means of cyclic voltammetry. A series of the CV measurements were conducted on a molybdenum wire electrode (0.5-mm diameter) in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic over the potential range from 0.00 to −1.87V vs Mo at the scan rates of 5, 10, 30, and 40mV∕s , respectively, and at 685°C. In this work, the current was taken as positive for a cathodic current while an anodic current was taken as negative. The electrolyte resistance between the working electrode and reference electrode surfaces was estimated from the measured value of the total circuit and electrolyte resistances across the two electrodes. The estimated value of the electrolyte resistance was about 0.2Ω over the temperature range 680-950°C. The Feedback IR compensation was employed in the present work to correct for the current-dependent error. The total circuit resistance (contact resistance and electrode lead resistances) varied from 0.7 to 1Ω .

Furthermore, cathodic deposition of sodium or calcium from pure NaCl or CaCl2 and their electrode potentials (E) calculated from thermodynamic data (ECa2+∕Ca=0) at 850, 900, and 950°C are given, respectively, in Table I.36 This table demonstrates that sodium can be deposited from pure NaCl at the potentials at least 38 mV more positive than that for calcium deposition from pure CaCl2 at temperatures between 850 and 950°C. The results in Table I also predict that sodium should be cathodically deposited from molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic prior to codeposition of Na-Ca alloys and that the deposition potentials of the Na-Ca alloys should be less cathodic than those of pure calcium as the activities of calcium in the alloys are less than unity.
7 Figure 2 a shows the CVs of a molybdenum wire in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic. It was found that the background current densities were less than 0.1A∕cm2 until the sodium deposition followed by the codeposition of the Na-Ca alloys from the electrolyte at the sufficiently negative potentials. The residual currents observed at the potentials less negative than those for the sodium deposition were probably due to a small amount of residual electronic conductivity in the thermally dried and pre-electrolyzed CaCl2-NaCl eutectic melt dissolved with a trace amount of calcium. 39 Nevertheless, the above observations indicated that the electrolyte purification through the procedures employed should be adequate for the present electrochemical studies at elevated temperatures. A further extension of the cathodic potential limit led to an almost linear increase in the cathodic currents at each scan rate used (marked by c1, c2, c3, and c4, respectively), suggesting that the cathodic deposition of the Na-Ca alloys was not limited by diffusion of the cations ( Na+ and Ca2+ ) in the melt. Given the facts that Na+ and Ca2+ were the only cations present in the CaCl2-NaCl eutectic melt and ENa+∕Na is positive with respect to ECa2+∕Ca (see Table I ), the reduction currents on the forward sweep should correspond only to the sodium deposition followed by the codeposition of the Na-Ca alloys from the eutectic melt. This deposition sequence was strongly supported by the two counterpart anodic current waves ( a10 and a11 ) scanned at the rate of 5mV∕s and ( a20 and a21 ) at the rate of 10mV∕s , respectively, which corresponded to anodic dissolutions of the Na-Ca alloys followed by the sodium into the melt. The two anodic current waves were gradually overlapped as the scan rates increased, especially from 10 to 40mV∕s (marked, respectively, by a2, a3, and a4 in Fig. 2 a). It was also noted that the cathodic currents corresponding to the depositions of sodium or Na-Ca alloys increased with scan rates under a given cathodic potential, indicative of the higher degrees of current shifting from the steady-state responses as a result of the shorter time scales of the experiment. 40 It should be mentioned that a small quantity of the deposited Na-Ca alloys could dissolve chemically into the electrolyte and diffuse into the bulk electrolyte because Na-Ca alloys have the appreciable solubilities in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic. 39 , 41 The sodium and calcium dissolved in the electrolyte were unlikely to be reoxidized electrochemically.

8 Figure 2 b illustrates the enlarged portion of the CVs in the negative potential range in Fig. 2 a, from which it can be seen that the cathodic reverse current traces crossed over the forward sweep. Such a type of CVs is commonly encountered in studies of the deposition of metals where metallic phases are deposited onto a foreign substrate. 21 , 40 The cause of the observed crossover was that a prerequisite for initial deposition of a metal such as sodium on a foreign substrate (like molybdenum wire) was the formation of thermodynamically stable nuclei on the surface. The formation of such nuclei usually required a potential more negative than that required to reduce metal cations (e.g., Na+ and Ca2+ ), in other words, it must overcome a nucleation overpotential (relatively high kinetic barrier) before the metal deposition commences. On the reverse sweep, however, the dissolution occurred on the surface of the deposited metal phases and thus this kinetic barrier disappeared. As a result, a higher reduction current flowed at the anodic scan potential compared to that at the cathodic scan potential.

9 Castrillejo et al. have carried out extensively the experimental investigations into the electrochemical properties of molten CaCl2-NaCl mixtures. 42 – 44 They recorded the CVs on tungsten and molybdenum wires in the molten equimolar CaCl2-NaCl mixture at 550°C, respectively, and found that each electrochemical window was limited on the cathodic side by the reduction of sodium ions to sodium. In addition, the crossover phenomenon was also observed on the CVs recorded. The present CVs recorded were in good agreement with those of the previous studies. 42 – 44

One sintered pellet of Nb2O5 was submerged in the molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic under dry high-purity argon at 850°C, without the application of any voltages. After 5-min immersion, the pellet was removed from the melt and was held in the cold zone of the reactor (about 300°C). The pellet sticking with the solidified electrolyte was then taken quickly out of the reactor and quenched in distilled water. After cleaning treatments, the pellet surface was characterized by XRD.

11 Figure 3a and 3b shows the XRD patterns measured on the surfaces of the sintered Nb2O5 pellet before and after immersion, respectively. It was found that Nb2O5 was the only phase present on the surface of the sintered Nb2O5 pellet before immersion (Fig. 3a ), whereas the major phase on the pellet surface after immersion was CaNb2O6 , with a trace-to-minor amount of Nb2O5 (Fig. 3b ). The cross section of the Nb2O5 pellet after immersion was further examined using SEM-EDXA. It was observed that a film of the oxide, corresponding closely to the composition of the CaNb2O6 , formed on the external surface of the immersed Nb2O5 pellet. These findings suggested that the solid Nb2O5 should have reacted chemically with the molten eutectic of CaCl2-NaCl under the experimental conditions used.

The pellet sticking with the solidified electrolyte was then taken quickly out of the reactor and quenched in distilled water. After cleaning treatments, the pellet surface was characterized by XRD.
12 It was believed that, upon immersion of the sintered pellet of Nb2O5 into the melt, the following reaction took place (Ref. 36 ) where (CaO) is the CaO dissolved in thermally dried and pre-electrolyzed CaCl2-NaCl eutectic melt. As the as-purchased CaCl22H2O was dehydrated by thermally drying the salt in air instead of bubbling chlorine or HCl gas into the molten salt, the hydrolysis which converted a small amount of CaCl2 to CaO inevitably occurred as CaCl2 is highly hygroscopic. The residual CaO present in the CaCl2-NaCl electrolyte subsequently reacted with the Nb2O5 , forming a film of CaNb2O6 at the external surface of the Nb2O5 pellet according to Reaction 5 . The variation of the theoretical decomposition potentials of CaNb2O6 with temperature is included in Fig. 1 , from which it can be seen that CaNb2O6 is thermodynamically more stable than any niobium oxides over the temperature range studied. Included in Table I are the thermodynamic oxygen ionization potentials of CaNb2O6 vs Ca2+∕Ca at 850, 900, and 950°C, respectively.

It was observed that a film of the oxide, corresponding closely to the composition of the CaNb2O6 , formed on the external surface of the immersed Nb2O5 pellet. These findings suggested that the solid Nb2O5 should have reacted chemically with the molten eutectic of CaCl2-NaCl under the experimental conditions used.
13 In the following CV and CA experiments, the sintered pellets of Nb2O5 fabricated under the conditions described previously were used as the working electrode material, the high-density graphite rod was utilized as the counterelectrode, and the stainless steel crucible functioned as the pseudoreference electrode. All the cathodic potentials (E) given below are expressed with respect to the dynamic deposition potentials of Na-Ca alloys measured in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic, i.e., E vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) . These were done by offsetting the values of the measured deposition potentials of the Na-Ca alloys vs the pseudoreference electrode to make them equal to 0 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) .

14 It was believed that, upon immersion of the sintered pellet of Nb2O5 into the melt, the following reaction took place(Ref. 36) where (CaO) is the CaO dissolved in thermally dried and pre-electrolyzed CaCl2-NaCl eutectic melt. As the as-purchased CaCl22H2O was dehydrated by thermally drying the salt in air instead of bubbling chlorine or HCl gas into the molten salt, the hydrolysis which converted a small amount of CaCl2 to CaO inevitably occurred as CaCl2 is highly hygroscopic. The residual CaO present in the CaCl2-NaCl electrolyte subsequently reacted with the Nb2O5 , forming a film of CaNb2O6 at the external surface of the Nb2O5 pellet according to Reaction 5. The variation of the theoretical decomposition potentials of CaNb2O6 with temperature is included in Fig. 1, from which it can be seen that CaNb2O6 is thermodynamically more stable than any niobium oxides over the temperature range studied. Included in Table I are the thermodynamic oxygen ionization potentials of CaNb2O6 vs Ca2+∕Ca at 850, 900, and 950°C, respectively.
14 Upon immersion of the Nb2O5 pellet into the thermally dried and pre-electrolyzed CaCl2-NaCl eutectic melt at 850-950°C, a thin film of the CaNb2O6 immediately formed on the external surface of the Nb2O5 pellet due to Reaction 5 . CV measurements were carried out on the CaNb2O6 film-covered Nb2O5 electrodes in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic at the scan rate of 30mV∕s over the potentials from 0.85 to −0.85V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) . The preliminary CV measurements showed that the further anodic scans beyond 0.85 V led to anodic dissolution of the molybdenum wire into the melt at the less positive potentials than that of chlorine evolution. A similar behavior had been observed in an equimolar CaCl2-NaCl melt. 44 The current inference stemming from the anodic dissolution of the molybdenum into the electrolyte made it difficult to interpret the recorded CVs for studying oxygen ionization reactions. As a consequence, the anodic scans were set only up to 0.85 V to avoid the dissolution of the molybdenum into the electrolyte during the measurements.

15 In the following CV and CA experiments, the sintered pellets of Nb2O5 fabricated under the conditions described previously were used as the working electrode material, the high-density graphite rod was utilized as the counterelectrode, and the stainless steel crucible functioned as the pseudoreference electrode. All the cathodic potentials (E) given below are expressed with respect to the dynamic deposition potentials of Na-Ca alloys measured in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic, i.e., E vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) . These were done by offsetting the values of the measured deposition potentials of the Na-Ca alloys vs the pseudoreference electrode to make them equal to 0 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) .
15 The CVs of a Nb2O5 electrode in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic recorded at 900 and 950°C are illustrated in Fig. 4 , respectively, from which several reduction current peaks marked by 1, 2, 3, and 4 at 900°C and 1′ , 2′ , 3′ , 4′ , and 5′ at 950°C, were clearly observed. It was evident that the cathodic currents appeared at the potentials about 0.8 V more positive than those of the Na-Ca alloy deposition from the molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic. The latter was characterized by almost linear increases in the cathodic currents with increasingly negative potentials. Possible cathodic reactions and their electrode potentials vs Ca2+∕Ca , calculated from the thermodynamic data at 850, 900, and 950°C, respectively, are given in Table I . Table I predicts that the cathodic oxygen ionization of CaNb2O6 can occur at the potentials 1.047 V vs Ca2+∕Ca less cathodic than the deposition potentials of sodium from molten NaCl at temperatures 850-950°C. As discussed previously, the deposition potentials of Na-Ca alloys from molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic lie between those of pure sodium and pure calcium. Therefore, the reduction current peaks observed at potentials much more positive than those of the sodium and Na-Ca alloy depositions, as shown in Fig. 4 , could only be the oxygen ionization of CaNb2O6 or niobium oxides, or a combination of both. Overall, the cyclic voltammograms in Fig. 4 exhibited two distinct regions, depending on the cathodic reactions occurring: ( i ) region 0.85 to 0 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) approximately, in which the oxygen ionization of the oxides at the electrode surface took place; ( ii ) region about 0 to −0.85V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) , where the predominant cathodic reaction was the deposition of the liquid Na-Ca alloys.

16 Upon immersion of the Nb2O5 pellet into the thermally dried and pre-electrolyzed CaCl2-NaCl eutectic melt at 850-950°C, a thin film of the CaNb2O6 immediately formed on the external surface of the Nb2O5 pellet due to Reaction 5. CV measurements were carried out on the CaNb2O6 film-covered Nb2O5 electrodes in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic at the scan rate of 30mV∕s over the potentials from 0.85 to −0.85V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) .

16 The effect of temperature on the CVs of a Nb2O5 electrode in thermally dried and pre-electrolyzed molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic is clearly evident from Fig. 4 . It can be seen that the reduction currents increased with increasing temperature, suggestive of the faster charge transfer and the enhanced mass transfer of the oxygen in the oxides at higher temperatures during the electrodeoxidation of solid Nb2O5 in the CaCl2-NaCl eutectic melt.

17 The CVs of a Nb2O5 electrode in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic recorded at 900 and 950°C are illustrated in Fig. 4, respectively, from which several reduction current peaks marked by 1, 2, 3, and 4 at 900°C and 1′ , 2′ , 3′ , 4′ , and 5′ at 950°C, were clearly observed. It was evident that the cathodic currents appeared at the potentials about 0.8 V more positive than those of the Na-Ca alloy deposition from the molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic. The latter was characterized by almost linear increases in the cathodic currents with increasingly negative potentials. Possible cathodic reactions and their electrode potentials vs Ca2+∕Ca , calculated from the thermodynamic data at 850, 900, and 950°C, respectively, are given in Table I. Table I predicts that the cathodic oxygen ionization of CaNb2O6 can occur at the potentials 1.047 V vs Ca2+∕Ca less cathodic than the deposition potentials of sodium from molten NaCl at temperatures 850-950°C. As discussed previously, the deposition potentials of Na-Ca alloys from molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic lie between those of pure sodium and pure calcium. Therefore, the reduction current peaks observed at potentials much more positive than those of the sodium and Na-Ca alloy depositions, as shown in Fig. 4, could only be the oxygen ionization of CaNb2O6 or niobium oxides, or a combination of both. Overall, the cyclic voltammograms in Fig. 4 exhibited two distinct regions, depending on the cathodic reactions occurring: (i) region 0.85 to 0 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) approximately, in which the oxygen ionization of the oxides at the electrode surface took place; (ii) region about 0 to −0.85V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) , where the predominant cathodic reaction was the deposition of the liquid Na-Ca alloys.
17 In order to further verify the concept of electrodeoxidation, the CV experiments were designed in such a way that the potential cycles were repeated four times at the scan rate of 30 mV/s at 850°C, where each scan toward a cathodic potential end was controlled to be less negative than that of the sodium deposition to avoid completely the deposition of the metals from the electrolyte. One independent CV measurement was also conducted on a molybdenum wire alone in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic under the same conditions as for the Nb2O5 working electrode at 850°C.
 ###### 
18 The effect of temperature on the CVs of a Nb2O5 electrode in thermally dried and pre-electrolyzed molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic is clearly evident from Fig. 4. It can be seen that the reduction currents increased with increasing temperature, suggestive of the faster charge transfer and the enhanced mass transfer of the oxygen in the oxides at higher temperatures during the electrodeoxidation of solid Nb2O5 in the CaCl2-NaCl eutectic melt.
18 Figure 5 a and b compares the CVs of a molybdenum wire alone and one pellet of Nb2O5 in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic at 850°C. It can be seen from Fig. 5 a that, with the molybdenum working electrode (the geometric area: 0.16cm2 ), the current flows should correspond only to the deposition-dissolution of the Na-Ca alloys at the potentials more negative than 0 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) . It was noted that the observed anodic current wave as marked by a3 in Fig. 2 a disappeared completely in the CV recorded at 850°C in Fig. 5 a. This was entirely due to the higher solubility of Na-Ca alloys in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic and the faster rate of dissolution of the deposited alloys into the melt at higher temperatures. For the CaNb2O6 film-covered Nb2O5 working electrode, waves 1, 2, and 3 were clearly observed in Fig. 5 b on the first forward sweep from 0.98 to 0.2 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) , strongly support the concept that the cathodic oxygen ionization of the CaNb2O6 and other oxides at the surface was the only cause responsible for the current flows. Wave 1 peaked at 0.84 V was believed to stem from the oxygen ionization of the CaNb2O6 film to NbO and probably niobium, although the oxygen ionization potentials of various niobium oxides listed in Table I appeared to be thermodynamically more favorable than that of CaNb2O6 over the potential range scanned. This was primarily because the CaNb2O6 film on the Nb2O5 electrode surface was in direct contact with the electrolyte, forming an electrochemical reduction site at the CaNb2O6 film-electrolyte interface. Current waves 2 and 3 were partially overlapped, with wave 3 peaked at 0.49 V. They were considered to correspond mainly to the oxygen ionizations of the remaining CaNb2O6 film and of the various niobium oxides including Nb2O5 and niobium oxides of lower oxidation states, which took place consecutively and/or simultaneously depending on the oxides available at the electrode surface in contact with the electrolyte. As the potential scan was reversed from 0.2 to 0.98 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) , the corresponding reverse waves 3′ , 2′ , and 1′ were peaked at 0.55, 0.76, and 0.92 V, respectively.

19 In order to further verify the concept of electrodeoxidation, the CV experiments were designed in such a way that the potential cycles were repeated four times at the scan rate of 30 mV/s at 850°C, where each scan toward a cathodic potential end was controlled to be less negative than that of the sodium deposition to avoid completely the deposition of the metals from the electrolyte. One independent CV measurement was also conducted on a molybdenum wire alone in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic under the same conditions as for the Nb2O5 working electrode at 850°C.
19 The scan cycle was repeated, following the first potential scan cycle. It can be seen from Fig. 5 b that the reduction currents decreased and the corresponding reverse currents increased as the scan cycling continued, suggesting that the concentration of the oxygen at the oxide electrode surface was lowered and the concentration of the O2− dissolved in the melt adjacent to the surface was raised. It was interesting to observe that, for the subsequent three scan cycles, waves a1, b1, and c1 on the forward scans had almost the identical onset potential of 0.94 V, while peak potentials for waves a2, b2, and c2 approached the more negative values as the scans were repeated. Several reverse waves on the reverse scans were observed, including a1′ , a2′ , and a2″ for the second cycle, b1′ and b2′ for the third cycle, and c1′ and c2′ for the fourth cycle. Similarly, they peaked at the increasingly negative potentials with increasing numbers of the scan cycles. These findings further revealed that the oxygen contents at the electrode surface had decreased and the concentrations of O2− in the melt near the surface had increased as a result of the repeated scan cycles, confirming the occurrence of Reaction 2 at the electrode surface over the potential region scanned. The CVs recorded on the second, third, and fourth scans exhibited similar general features but differed from that of the first scan, characteristic of the formation of new oxides other than CaNb2O6 at the electrode surface after the first scan cycle.

20 Figure 5a and b compares the CVs of a molybdenum wire alone and one pellet of Nb2O5 in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic at 850°C. It can be seen from Fig. 5a that, with the molybdenum working electrode (the geometric area: 0.16cm2 ), the current flows should correspond only to the deposition-dissolution of the Na-Ca alloys at the potentials more negative than 0 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) . It was noted that the observed anodic current wave as marked by a3 in Fig. 2a disappeared completely in the CV recorded at 850°C in Fig. 5a. This was entirely due to the higher solubility of Na-Ca alloys in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic and the faster rate of dissolution of the deposited alloys into the melt at higher temperatures. For the CaNb2O6 film-covered Nb2O5 working electrode, waves 1, 2, and 3 were clearly observed in Fig. 5b on the first forward sweep from 0.98 to 0.2 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) , strongly support the concept that the cathodic oxygen ionization of the CaNb2O6 and other oxides at the surface was the only cause responsible for the current flows. Wave 1 peaked at 0.84 V was believed to stem from the oxygen ionization of the CaNb2O6 film to NbO and probably niobium, although the oxygen ionization potentials of various niobium oxides listed in Table I appeared to be thermodynamically more favorable than that of CaNb2O6 over the potential range scanned. This was primarily because the CaNb2O6 film on the Nb2O5 electrode surface was in direct contact with the electrolyte, forming an electrochemical reduction site at the CaNb2O6 film-electrolyte interface. Current waves 2 and 3 were partially overlapped, with wave 3 peaked at 0.49 V. They were considered to correspond mainly to the oxygen ionizations of the remaining CaNb2O6 film and of the various niobium oxides including Nb2O5 and niobium oxides of lower oxidation states, which took place consecutively and/or simultaneously depending on the oxides available at the electrode surface in contact with the electrolyte. As the potential scan was reversed from 0.2 to 0.98 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) , the corresponding reverse waves 3′ , 2′ , and 1′ were peaked at 0.55, 0.76, and 0.92 V, respectively.
20 The potential dependence of the resulting reaction products at the electrode surface was investigated experimentally using the CA technique. Each CA measurement lasted for 5 min. Figure 6 shows a family of the CAs of a Nb2O5 electrode in thermally dried and pre-electrolyzed molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic at 850°C in response to the potential steps of 0.7, 0.45, 0.2, and −1.05V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) , respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 5 b, no cathodic deposition of the sodium or Na-Ca alloys from the electrolyte would be anticipated at the applied steps of 0.7, 0.45, and 0.2 V (Fig. 6a, 6b and 6c ), whereas both cathodic deposition of the Na-Ca alloys and oxygen ionization of the oxides at the working electrode surface must occur at the step of −1.05V (Fig. 6e ). The CA of a molybdenum wire alone in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic at 850°C at the step of 0.2 V was shown in Fig. 6d for comparison. Figure 6d shows that no currents flowed in response to the step of 0.2 V for the molybdenum wire alone, confirming the absence of any electrochemical reactions taking place at this step. However, when the same potential of 0.2 V was applied to the Nb2O5 working electrode in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic, an onset of the cathodic currents of 0.8 A followed by the current decay was clearly evident from Fig. 6c . The currents observed in Fig. 6c corresponded only to the oxygen ionization of the oxides occurring at the electrode surface because the cathodic deposition of the metals from the electrolyte was unlikely to occur at the step of 0.2 V, as evident from Fig. 6d . It was found from Fig. 6a and 6b that the cathodic currents were generated at even less cathodic potential steps of 0.7 and 0.45 V, respectively, demonstrating that the oxygen ionization of the oxides had happened at the surface under these conditions. The CAs in Fig. 6a, 6b, 6c and 6d provided reliable evidence to confirm that the cathodic oxygen ionization of the CaNb2O6 film-covered Nb2O5 electrode in the aforementioned CaCl2-NaCl eutectic melt occurred at the potentials more positive than the cathodic deposition of the sodium from the eutectic melt. The results were consistent with those from the CV measurements. Figure 6e shows that the resulting cathodic currents in response to the step of −1.05V were retained at the nearly steady values of 0.8-1 A, which were much higher than those in Fig. 6a, 6b and 6c over the entire time domain. The result in Fig. 6e indicated that the cathodic processes at the step of −1.05V involved both the cathodic deposition of the Na-Ca alloys from molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic onto the electrode surface and the oxygen ionization of the oxides at the surface.

21 The scan cycle was repeated, following the first potential scan cycle. It can be seen from Fig. 5b that the reduction currents decreased and the corresponding reverse currents increased as the scan cycling continued, suggesting that the concentration of the oxygen at the oxide electrode surface was lowered and the concentration of the O2− dissolved in the melt adjacent to the surface was raised. It was interesting to observe that, for the subsequent three scan cycles, waves a1, b1, and c1 on the forward scans had almost the identical onset potential of 0.94 V, while peak potentials for waves a2, b2, and c2 approached the more negative values as the scans were repeated. Several reverse waves on the reverse scans were observed, including a1′ , a2′ , and a2″ for the second cycle, b1′ and b2′ for the third cycle, and c1′ and c2′ for the fourth cycle. Similarly, they peaked at the increasingly negative potentials with increasing numbers of the scan cycles. These findings further revealed that the oxygen contents at the electrode surface had decreased and the concentrations of O2− in the melt near the surface had increased as a result of the repeated scan cycles, confirming the occurrence of Reaction 2 at the electrode surface over the potential region scanned. The CVs recorded on the second, third, and fourth scans exhibited similar general features but differed from that of the first scan, characteristic of the formation of new oxides other than CaNb2O6 at the electrode surface after the first scan cycle.
21 In the present electrochemical cell, the molten CaCl2-NaCl electrolyte was unstirred and the working electrode in the electrolyte was presumed to be a planar CaNb2O6 film-covered Nb2O5 electrode by neglecting the surface roughness of the oxide pellet. The current-time response of the CaNb2O6 film-covered Nb2O5 electrode in molten CaCl2-NaCl to the potential steps applied may be replotted from the data in Fig. 6a, 6b, 6c and 6e , as shown in Fig. 7 , according to the modified Cottrell equation below 45 , 46 where n is the stoichiometric number of electrons involved in a cathodic reaction, A is the apparent electrode area, DO is the diffusion coefficient of the oxygen in an outer oxide layer of the electrode in contact with the electrolyte, and CO* is the bulk concentration of the oxygen in an outer oxide layer of the electrode. Equation 6 predicts that a plot of I(t)t vs t1∕2 should be linear with a slope of nFADO1∕2CO*∕π1∕2 in a time domain, where the semi-infinite diffusion of the oxygen in the outer oxide layer of the electrode toward the electrode surface controls the rate of potentiostatic electrolysis.

22 The potential dependence of the resulting reaction products at the electrode surface was investigated experimentally using the CA technique. Each CA measurement lasted for 5 min. Figure 6 shows a family of the CAs of a Nb2O5 electrode in thermally dried and pre-electrolyzed molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic at 850°C in response to the potential steps of 0.7, 0.45, 0.2, and −1.05V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) , respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 5b, no cathodic deposition of the sodium or Na-Ca alloys from the electrolyte would be anticipated at the applied steps of 0.7, 0.45, and 0.2 V (Fig. 6a, 6b and 6c), whereas both cathodic deposition of the Na-Ca alloys and oxygen ionization of the oxides at the working electrode surface must occur at the step of −1.05V (Fig. 6e).

Figure 6d shows that no currents flowed in response to the step of 0.2 V for the molybdenum wire alone, confirming the absence of any electrochemical reactions taking place at this step.

22 Figure 7 a-c shows that I(t)t is linear with t1∕2 at each initial stage of potentiostatic electrolysis at the steps applied. The slopes calculated for each linear region of the plots had the magnitude of 1.08 over a time domain of 0-10 s at the step of 0.7 V, 1.092 over 0-30 s at the step of 0.45 V, and 1.087 over 0-22 s at the step of 0.2 V, respectively, with the correlation coefficients for linear regression better than 0.997. These implied that the current flows over each initial linear region could result from a unique and identical cathodic reaction. Otherwise, the reaction sequence [thus, the slop of each I(t)t vs t1∕2 plot] would be changed as the potentials varied from 0.7 to 0.2 V, as clearly evident from the CVs in Fig. 5 b. It was observed from Fig. 7 a-c that the plots of I(t)t vs t1∕2 curved beyond point a, implying that two or more cathodic reactions had taken place during these periods. Figure 7 d shows that I(t)t was not linear with t1∕2 over the entire time domain. Thereby, the modified Cottrell equation was not applicable to the regions beyond point a in Fig. 7 a-c and to the entire region in Fig. 7 d, over which the linearity of I(t)t vs t1∕2 plot did not exist.

23 After the CA measurements and cleaning treatment on the working electrodes, the electrode surfaces were characterized by means of SEM, EDXA, and XRD to clarify the interrelationship between the microstructures/surface compositions, the phases present on the surface, and the potential steps applied. The information about the surface characteristics of the electrodes is useful to ascertain at what potential the electrodeoxidation of particular oxides would occur.

24 Figure 7a-c shows that I(t)t is linear with t1∕2 at each initial stage of potentiostatic electrolysis at the steps applied. The slopes calculated for each linear region of the plots had the magnitude of 1.08 over a time domain of 0-10 s at the step of 0.7 V, 1.092 over 0-30 s at the step of 0.45 V, and 1.087 over 0-22 s at the step of 0.2 V, respectively, with the correlation coefficients for linear regression better than 0.997. These implied that the current flows over each initial linear region could result from a unique and identical cathodic reaction. Otherwise, the reaction sequence [thus, the slop of each I(t)t vs t1∕2 plot] would be changed as the potentials varied from 0.7 to 0.2 V, as clearly evident from the CVs in Fig. 5b. It was observed from Fig. 7a-c that the plots of I(t)t vs t1∕2 curved beyond point a, implying that two or more cathodic reactions had taken place during these periods. Figure 7d shows that I(t)t was not linear with t1∕2 over the entire time domain. Thereby, the modified Cottrell equation was not applicable to the regions beyond point a in Fig. 7a-c and to the entire region in Fig. 7d, over which the linearity of I(t)t vs t1∕2 plot did not exist.
24 Figure 8a, 8b, 8c, 8d and 8e is the SEM backscattered electron images showing the potential dependence of the microstructures of the working electrode surfaces after 5-min potentiostatic electrolysis, with that for the sintered Nb2O5 electrode before immersion into the electrolyte also included for comparison. Although there were a few voids and variations in the grain sizes on the surface of the sintered pellet of Nb2O5 (Fig. 8a ), it was still reasonable to assume the CaNb2O6 film-covered Nb2O5 working electrode to be the planar electrode when applying Eq. 6 for interpreting the ac behavior. As clearly evident from Fig. 8b, 8c, 8d and 8e , the microstructure of the electrode surfaces after the CA measurements varied with the potential steps applied over the range 0.7 to −1.05V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) , which supported the occurrence of the oxygen ionization of the oxides at the surfaces.

The information about the surface characteristics of the electrodes is useful to ascertain at what potential the electrodeoxidation of particular oxides would occur.
25 An EDXA analysis was made to analyze the overall elemental compositions on the electrode surfaces after each potentiostatic electrolysis. Presented in Table II are the EDXA data measured on the complete area of each image in Fig. 8b, 8c, 8d and 8e . It can be seen that the overall elemental compositions on the working electrodes varied with the potential steps and the significant degree of electrodeoxidation was achieved after 5-min potentiostatic electrolysis at the step of 0.2 V.

26 Figure 9a, 9b, 9c and 9d shows the XRD spectra of the electrode surfaces after the CA experiments. As evident from Fig. 9a, 9b, 9c and 9d , there were the changes in their relative amounts of the existing phases and the formation of the new phases on the working electrode surfaces over the potential range investigated. A comparison of the XRD pattern in Fig. 3b with those in Fig. 9a, 9b and 9c revealed that electrodeoxidation of the various oxides at the surfaces had taken place to some extent at the step range of 0.7-0.2 V over which the calcium was unlikely to be electrodeposited from the electrolyte.
 ###### 
27 An EDXA analysis was made to analyze the overall elemental compositions on the electrode surfaces after each potentiostatic electrolysis. Presented in Table II are the EDXA data measured on the complete area of each image in Fig. 8b, 8c, 8d and 8e. It can be seen that the overall elemental compositions on the working electrodes varied with the potential steps and the significant degree of electrodeoxidation was achieved after 5-min potentiostatic electrolysis at the step of 0.2 V.
27 The CA features were rationalized with the help of the surface characteristics of the electrodes obtained before and after the CA measurements. In this work, the overall surface composition of the CaNb2O6 film-covered Nb2O5 electrode in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic was taken as the stoichiometric composition of CaNb2O6 before the measurements.

28 Figure 9a, 9b, 9c and 9d shows the XRD spectra of the electrode surfaces after the CA experiments. As evident from Fig. 9a, 9b, 9c and 9d, there were the changes in their relative amounts of the existing phases and the formation of the new phases on the working electrode surfaces over the potential range investigated. A comparison of the XRD pattern in Fig. 3b with those in Fig. 9a, 9b and 9c revealed that electrodeoxidation of the various oxides at the surfaces had taken place to some extent at the step range of 0.7-0.2 V over which the calcium was unlikely to be electrodeposited from the electrolyte.
28 1. The CA features at a potential step of 0.7 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) . The EDXA results in Table II show that the niobium content on the surfaces rose slightly and the calcium content dropped off to some extent from the stoichiometric composition of CaNb2O6 in response to the 5-min potentiostatic electrolysis at the step of 0.7 V, whereas the oxygen content remained almost unchanged. A comparison between the two XRD patterns in Fig. 3b and 9a clearly revealed that the peaks for CaNb2O6 phase weaken substantially and the peaks for Nb2O5 phase became much stronger. Besides, the several new phases were detected, including NbO2 as the medium-to-major phase and CaNbO3 and Ca2Nb2O7 only as the trace phases. These results provided strong evidence that the oxygen ionization of the CaNb2O6 had occurred at the step of 0.7 V.

29 The CA features were rationalized with the help of the surface characteristics of the electrodes obtained before and after the CA measurements. In this work, the overall surface composition of the CaNb2O6 film-covered Nb2O5 electrode in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic was taken as the stoichiometric composition of CaNb2O6 before the measurements.
29 Given the facts that the CaNb2O6 film-electrolyte interface was initially established and that I(t)t is linear with t1∕2 over the very short time domain of 0-10 s (initial linear region in Fig. 7 a), the following cathodic reaction was proposed Although a solid phase of Nb2O5−δ formed after about 10-s potentiostatic electrolysis, the amount of the Nb2O5−δ was believed to be negligibly small compared to that of the remaining CaNb2O6 at the surface. Nb2O5 is an electrically insulating oxide. The electrical conductivity of Nb2O5−δ increases with increasing value of δ. 47 Intercalated compounds, such as CaNb2O6 , are generally very good electronic conductors. The electrical conductivity of the Nb2O5−δ formed over the initial linear region was believed to be much lower than that of CaNb2O6 at 850°C, which made it difficult for electrons to transfer from the conductive CaNb2O6 to the resistive Nb2O5−δ -electrolyte interface due to relatively high bulk resistances of the Nb2O5−δ and phase-boundary resistances between the CaNb2O6 and the Nb2O5−δ . Reaction 7 was predominately responsible for the cathodic currents as shown in Fig. 7 a, which was controlled by the oxygen diffusion within the CaNb2O6 film toward the film-electrolyte interface, lasting only for 10 s or so. The observed linearity of I(t)t vs t1∕2 plot over the domain of 0-10 s strongly supported that the oxygen had diffused only within the CaNb2O6 .

30 1. The CA features at a potential step of 0.7 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) . The EDXA results in Table II show that the niobium content on the surfaces rose slightly and the calcium content dropped off to some extent from the stoichiometric composition of CaNb2O6 in response to the 5-min potentiostatic electrolysis at the step of 0.7 V, whereas the oxygen content remained almost unchanged. A comparison between the two XRD patterns in Fig. 3b and 9a clearly revealed that the peaks for CaNb2O6 phase weaken substantially and the peaks for Nb2O5 phase became much stronger. Besides, the several new phases were detected, including NbO2 as the medium-to-major phase and CaNbO3 and Ca2Nb2O7 only as the trace phases. These results provided strong evidence that the oxygen ionization of the CaNb2O6 had occurred at the step of 0.7 V.
30 As Reaction 7 proceeded, the area ratio of the remaining CaNb2O6 to the Nb2O5−δ at the surface decreased and the magnitude of δ increased, the formed Nb2O5−δ could be also electrodeoxidized at the Nb2O5−δ -electrolyte interface beyond point a in Fig. 7 a. The oxygen thus diffused simultaneously within the CaNb2O6 and Nb2O5−δ toward the oxides-electrolyte interface, causing changes in the slop in the I(t)t vs t1∕2 plot, as evident from Fig. 7 a. Reaction 8a, 8b below, along with Reaction 7 , were considered to occur simultaneously over the a-b region in Fig. 7 a where the Nb2O5 could just appear as the CaNb2O6 film was electrodeoxidized, showing the Nb2O5 from the bulk pellet. Reaction 8b only occurred at three phase boundaries between the Nb2O5 , the molybdenum electrode lead, and the electrolyte due to the insulating property of Nb2O5 . Reaction 8a, 8b was believed to the main cathodic reaction in the b-c portion of the plot. Beyond point c, the following reactions were proposed to occur to a very low extent, together with Reaction 7, 8a, 8b
 ###### 
31 Given the facts that the CaNb2O6 film-electrolyte interface was initially established and that I(t)t is linear with t1∕2 over the very short time domain of 0-10 s (initial linear region in Fig. 7a), the following cathodic reaction was proposedAlthough a solid phase of Nb2O5−δ formed after about 10-s potentiostatic electrolysis, the amount of the Nb2O5−δ was believed to be negligibly small compared to that of the remaining CaNb2O6 at the surface. Nb2O5 is an electrically insulating oxide. The electrical conductivity of Nb2O5−δ increases with increasing value of δ.47 Intercalated compounds, such as CaNb2O6 , are generally very good electronic conductors. The electrical conductivity of the Nb2O5−δ formed over the initial linear region was believed to be much lower than that of CaNb2O6 at 850°C, which made it difficult for electrons to transfer from the conductive CaNb2O6 to the resistive Nb2O5−δ -electrolyte interface due to relatively high bulk resistances of the Nb2O5−δ and phase-boundary resistances between the CaNb2O6 and the Nb2O5−δ .

The observed linearity of I(t)t vs t1∕2 plot over the domain of 0-10 s strongly supported that the oxygen had diffused only within the CaNb2O6 .
31 2. The CA features at a potential step of 0.45 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) . It was found that the surface morphology of the electrode stepped to the potential of 0.45 V (Fig. 8c ) differed significantly from that of 0.7 V (Fig. 8b ), suggesting that the different cathodic reactions should have happened at the surfaces in response to the two different steps. The surface morphology, as shown in Fig. 8c , was characterized by many more dendritical crystals. The EDXA analysis revealed a slight increase in the calcium content and a decrease in the oxygen on the surface, with the niobium content almost unchanged after the electrode was stepped to 0.45 V. The XRD pattern measured for the electrode surface in Fig. 8c is shown in Fig. 9b , from which it was found that the peaks for both NbO2 and CaNb2O6 phases got stronger, whereas the peaks for Nb2O5 got weaker compared to those in Fig. 9a . A phase of CaNb2O6 (PDF number: 39-1392) possesses an orthorhombic structure. It was, hence, believed that the dendritic structure observed from Fig. 8c was the CaNb2O6 phase (PDF number: 39-1392), as evident from Fig. 9b , which grew from its origin of the orthorhombic structure. These findings, of course, implied the possibility of the reformation of the CaNb2O6 phase on the surface during the potentiostatic electrolysis at the step of 0.45 V.
 ###### 
32 As Reaction 7 proceeded, the area ratio of the remaining CaNb2O6 to the Nb2O5−δ at the surface decreased and the magnitude of δ increased, the formed Nb2O5−δ could be also electrodeoxidized at the Nb2O5−δ -electrolyte interface beyond point a in Fig. 7a. The oxygen thus diffused simultaneously within the CaNb2O6 and Nb2O5−δ toward the oxides-electrolyte interface, causing changes in the slop in the I(t)t vs t1∕2 plot, as evident from Fig. 7a. Reaction 8a, 8b below, along with Reaction 7, were considered to occur simultaneously over the a-b region in Fig. 7a where the Nb2O5 could just appear as the CaNb2O6 film was electrodeoxidized, showing the Nb2O5 from the bulk pellet. Reaction 8b only occurred at three phase boundaries between the Nb2O5 , the molybdenum electrode lead, and the electrolyte due to the insulating property of Nb2O5 . Reaction 8a, 8b was believed to the main cathodic reaction in the b-c portion of the plot. Beyond point c, the following reactions were proposed to occur to a very low extent, together with Reaction 7, 8a, 8b
32 As the slopes of linear regression lines for initial linear regions in Fig. 7 a and b are virtually identical, Reaction 7 was believed to occur initially at the step of 0.45 V, which lasted for approximately 30 s. Again, the cathodic process was controlled by the oxygen diffusion in the CaNb2O6 film toward the CaNb2O6 film-electrolyte interface. Reactions 7, 8a, 8b, 9, 10 taking place over the regimes of a-b, b-c, and c-d at the step of 0.7 V were also considered to occur over the same regions at the step of 0.45 V.
 ###### 
33 2. The CA features at a potential step of 0.45 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) . It was found that the surface morphology of the electrode stepped to the potential of 0.45 V (Fig. 8c) differed significantly from that of 0.7 V (Fig. 8b), suggesting that the different cathodic reactions should have happened at the surfaces in response to the two different steps. The surface morphology, as shown in Fig. 8c, was characterized by many more dendritical crystals. The EDXA analysis revealed a slight increase in the calcium content and a decrease in the oxygen on the surface, with the niobium content almost unchanged after the electrode was stepped to 0.45 V. The XRD pattern measured for the electrode surface in Fig. 8c is shown in Fig. 9b, from which it was found that the peaks for both NbO2 and CaNb2O6 phases got stronger, whereas the peaks for Nb2O5 got weaker compared to those in Fig. 9a. A phase of CaNb2O6 (PDF number: 39-1392) possesses an orthorhombic structure. It was, hence, believed that the dendritic structure observed from Fig. 8c was the CaNb2O6 phase (PDF number: 39-1392), as evident from Fig. 9b, which grew from its origin of the orthorhombic structure. These findings, of course, implied the possibility of the reformation of the CaNb2O6 phase on the surface during the potentiostatic electrolysis at the step of 0.45 V.
33 Based on the surface characteristics observed in Fig. 8c and the discussion given above, it was believed that the calcium intercalation reaction below was involved in the cathodic process over the b-d portion of I(t)t vs t1∕2 plot in Fig. 7 b where the calcium cations in the electrolyte were intercalated electrochemically into the Nb2O5 structure. The net effect of Reaction 11 was the rise in the calcium content on the electrode surface at the step of 0.45 V as opposed to that of 0.7 V, which was clearly evident from the EDXA data in Table II . In fact, intercalation of cations of alkali and alkaline earth metals into some solid phases of special structures is well known. 48 In the lithium ion battery, e.g., the intercalation of lithium occurs into either the graphite negative or metal oxide positive electrodes. The intercalation principle was also applied successfully by Fray et al. to intercalate lithium from the molten Al-Li alloys into lithium titanate for the molten aluminum purification. 23 , 48 More recently, the intercalation mechanism was proposed by Fray et al. in the cases of electrodeoxidation of Cr2O3 and TiO2 in CaCl2 -based chloride melts. 21 , 27 A similar mechanism was suggested by Gourishanker et al. during the reduction of UO2 in a LiCl melt. 49 When the insulating Nb2O5 was intercalated with calcium, it became electronically conductive. The formation of the calcium-intercalated Nb2O5 allowed the cathodic oxygen ionization to proceed at the oxide-electrolyte interface rather than at the three-phase boundaries as required for the oxygen ionization of pure Nb2O5 .
 ###### 
34 As the slopes of linear regression lines for initial linear regions in Fig. 7a and b are virtually identical, Reaction 7 was believed to occur initially at the step of 0.45 V, which lasted for approximately 30 s. Again, the cathodic process was controlled by the oxygen diffusion in the CaNb2O6 film toward the CaNb2O6 film-electrolyte interface. Reactions 7, 8a, 8b, 9, 10 taking place over the regimes of a-b, b-c, and c-d at the step of 0.7 V were also considered to occur over the same regions at the step of 0.45 V.
34 3. The CA features at a potential step of 0.2 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) . It was found that the dendritic CaNb2O6 phase as observed in Fig. 8c almost disappeared from the surface shown in Fig. 8d . The SEM/EDXA examinations showed that there were a few bright spots, about 5- to 10-μm in size, distributed on the electrode surface. The niobium content within the spots was found to be as high as 99.0 wt %, indicating that these bright spots corresponded to the metallic niobium phase. The EDXA analysis also revealed that the overall contents of calcium and oxygen were lowered drastically, whereas the overall niobium content was increased considerably after the measurement at the step of 0.2 V, indicating that the oxygen ionizations of the various oxides of niobium and calcium at the surface had taken place to a great extent. The XRD spectrum of the electrode surface shown in Fig. 8d is illustrated in Fig. 9c , from which it was found that the peaks for CaNb2O5 and NbO2 phases were weaker than those in Fig. 9b . In addition, a new phase of NbO was detected. Although the metallic niobium phase (as bright spots) was clearly observed under SEM in Fig. 8d , it was not detected by XRD because the sizes of the bright spots were too small to be detected using XRD on the unpolished electrode surface.
 ###### 
35 Based on the surface characteristics observed in Fig. 8c and the discussion given above, it was believed that the calcium intercalation reaction below was involved in the cathodic process over the b-d portion of I(t)t vs t1∕2 plot in Fig. 7bwhere the calcium cations in the electrolyte were intercalated electrochemically into the Nb2O5 structure. The net effect of Reaction 11 was the rise in the calcium content on the electrode surface at the step of 0.45 V as opposed to that of 0.7 V, which was clearly evident from the EDXA data in Table II. In fact, intercalation of cations of alkali and alkaline earth metals into some solid phases of special structures is well known.48 In the lithium ion battery, e.g., the intercalation of lithium occurs into either the graphite negative or metal oxide positive electrodes.

The formation of the calcium-intercalated Nb2O5 allowed the cathodic oxygen ionization to proceed at the oxide-electrolyte interface rather than at the three-phase boundaries as required for the oxygen ionization of pure Nb2O5 .
35 Figure 7 c shows that there existed the initial linear region over the time domain of 0-22 s on the I(t)t vs t1∕2 plot at the step of 0.2 V. The slope of the linear regression line over the region was almost equal to that of the initial linear region in Fig. 7 a or b, suggestive of the same cathodic reaction (i.e., Reaction 7 ) and reaction mechanism as those at the step of 0.7 or 0.45 V. The cathodic reactions over the region of point a to b at the step of 0.2 V were believed to be Reactions 7, 8a, 8b occurring simultaneously.
 ###### 
36 3. The CA features at a potential step of 0.2 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) . It was found that the dendritic CaNb2O6 phase as observed in Fig. 8c almost disappeared from the surface shown in Fig. 8d. The SEM/EDXA examinations showed that there were a few bright spots, about 5- to 10-μm in size, distributed on the electrode surface. The niobium content within the spots was found to be as high as 99.0 wt %, indicating that these bright spots corresponded to the metallic niobium phase. The EDXA analysis also revealed that the overall contents of calcium and oxygen were lowered drastically, whereas the overall niobium content was increased considerably after the measurement at the step of 0.2 V, indicating that the oxygen ionizations of the various oxides of niobium and calcium at the surface had taken place to a great extent. The XRD spectrum of the electrode surface shown in Fig. 8d is illustrated in Fig. 9c, from which it was found that the peaks for CaNb2O5 and NbO2 phases were weaker than those in Fig. 9b. In addition, a new phase of NbO was detected. Although the metallic niobium phase (as bright spots) was clearly observed under SEM in Fig. 8d, it was not detected by XRD because the sizes of the bright spots were too small to be detected using XRD on the unpolished electrode surface.
36 Reactions 12, 13 below, along with Reaction 9 , were likely to occur over the b-c portion of the plot, with Reactions 12, 13 leading to the formation of NbO Furthermore, the following postulated cathodic reactions could occur at the later stage of potentiostatic electrolysis, responsible for the formation of small amounts of the metallic niobium and the significant decrease in the calcium content on the electrode surface as confirmed by SEM/EDXA analyses
 ###### 
37 Figure 7c shows that there existed the initial linear region over the time domain of 0-22 s on the I(t)t vs t1∕2 plot at the step of 0.2 V. The slope of the linear regression line over the region was almost equal to that of the initial linear region in Fig. 7a or b, suggestive of the same cathodic reaction (i.e., Reaction 7) and reaction mechanism as those at the step of 0.7 or 0.45 V. The cathodic reactions over the region of point a to b at the step of 0.2 V were believed to be Reactions 7, 8a, 8b occurring simultaneously.
37 It was noted from Table II that, over the potential range of 0.7-0.2 V, the sodium cations present in the electrolyte had not been intercalated into any oxide structures at the electrode surface under these conditions used, although the ionic radio for Na+(0.95×10−8cm) is even smaller than that of Ca2+(0.99×10−8cm) . 50 This was probably because the calcium niobates formed were thermodynamically more stable than sodium niobates in the CaCl2-NaCl eutectic melt.

38 4. The CA features at a potential step of −1.05V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) . When the cathodic potential was stepped to −1.05V , the cathodic deposition of the Na-Ca alloys from the electrolyte and the oxygen ionization of the oxides at the surface would take place. The overall elemental composition on the electrode surface after the CA measurement at the step of −1.05V is included in Table II , from which it can be seen that the resulting surface composition was quite similar to that of 0.2 V. The XRD spectra of the electrode surfaces in Fig. 9c and 9d also showed the similarity in the phases present. The present results provided strong evidence that the involvement of the calciothermic reduction of the oxides at the surface did not enhance the overall kinetics of removal of the oxygen from the oxides on the time scale of the experiment.
 ###### 
39 It was noted from Table II that, over the potential range of 0.7-0.2 V, the sodium cations present in the electrolyte had not been intercalated into any oxide structures at the electrode surface under these conditions used, although the ionic radio for Na+(0.95×10−8cm) is even smaller than that of Ca2+(0.99×10−8cm) .50 This was probably because the calcium niobates formed were thermodynamically more stable than sodium niobates in the CaCl2-NaCl eutectic melt.
39 Figure 7 d shows that there was no linear relationship between I(t)t and t1∕2 on the plot, indicating that the modified Cottrell equation did not apply over the entire time domain. It was inevitable that, apart from the oxygen ionization of the various oxides as summarized by Reaction 2 , the following reactions would occur consecutively at the electrode surface The liquid Na-Ca alloys were electrodeposited onto the working electrode surface once the oxides became electronically conducting or onto the wound molybdenum wire through Reaction 18 . The various oxides in contact with the Na-Ca alloys at the surface were then reduced by the calcium in the alloys due to Reaction 19 , with the CaO dissolved subsequently into the CaCl2-NaCl melt. The dissolution of the CaO into the electrolyte melt would facilitate Reaction 19 . It should be mentioned that the reduction of the niobium oxides by the calcium was thermodynamically much more favorable than that by the sodium. One of the reasons was that there is no solubility of the Na2O in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic at 850°C.
 ###### 
40 4. The CA features at a potential step of −1.05V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) . When the cathodic potential was stepped to −1.05V , the cathodic deposition of the Na-Ca alloys from the electrolyte and the oxygen ionization of the oxides at the surface would take place. The overall elemental composition on the electrode surface after the CA measurement at the step of −1.05V is included in Table II, from which it can be seen that the resulting surface composition was quite similar to that of 0.2 V. The XRD spectra of the electrode surfaces in Fig. 9c and 9d also showed the similarity in the phases present. The present results provided strong evidence that the involvement of the calciothermic reduction of the oxides at the surface did not enhance the overall kinetics of removal of the oxygen from the oxides on the time scale of the experiment.
40 As can be seen from Table II , the extent of oxygen removal from the CaNb2O6 film-covered Nb2O5 electrode surfaces was very close after the potentiostatic electrolysis at the applied steps of 0.2 and −1.05V . This demonstrated that the presence of the molten Na-Ca alloys on the oxide electrode surface had little impact on enhancing the overall kinetics of reduction of solid Nb2O5 in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic. It was evident from Fig. 6c and 6e that the resulting current flows at the step of 0.2 V were much lower than those of −1.05V , implying that the electrodeoxidation process for niobium production can potentially offer significant energy savings compared to the calciothermic reduction process. Furthermore, in the electrodeoxidation process, the chloride anions in the electrolyte were unlikely to discharge at the graphite rod anode since the cell voltages, after considering the IR drop, were chosen to be less than those required to decompose the CaCl2-NaCl electrolyte. The chlorine gas released from the electrolytic cell will cause the environmental concerns. The ratio of open-to-closed porosity of the oxide electrode is directly related to the electrode area ( A in Eq. 6 ). The higher the ratio, the larger the electrode area will be; thus higher reduction currents (faster rate of electrolysis) will be anticipated. The previous studies showed that once the oxide pellets were immersed into the salt melt, they were quickly saturated with the salts by penetrating into the open pores. After the electrodeoxidation, the pellets were simply withdrawn from the melt and allowed to cool. The solidified salts had penetrated throughout the reduced pellets, as observed under SEM, indicating that the melt was within the pores. 23 , 29 The present studies suggest that the pellets of Nb2O5 should possess the structures with high levels of open porosity to ensure the high rate of electrodeoxidation.

41 Figure 7d shows that there was no linear relationship between I(t)t and t1∕2 on the plot, indicating that the modified Cottrell equation did not apply over the entire time domain. It was inevitable that, apart from the oxygen ionization of the various oxides as summarized by Reaction 2, the following reactions would occur consecutively at the electrode surface The liquid Na-Ca alloys were electrodeposited onto the working electrode surface once the oxides became electronically conducting or onto the wound molybdenum wire through Reaction 18.

The dissolution of the CaO into the electrolyte melt would facilitate Reaction 19. It should be mentioned that the reduction of the niobium oxides by the calcium was thermodynamically much more favorable than that by the sodium. One of the reasons was that there is no solubility of the Na2O in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic at 850°C.
41 The electrochemical properties of pure CaCl2 , NaCl , and a CaCl2-NaCl eutectic have been evaluated from the thermodynamic data at 685-950°C. The study showed that the deposition of the liquid sodium from molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic occurs at less cathodic potentials than those of the molten Na-Ca alloys over the temperature range investigated. The electrochemistry of thermally dried and pre-electrolyzed CaCl2-NaCl eutectic melt was studied experimentally using cyclic voltammetry. The cyclic voltammograms of a molybdenum electrode showed that the window was limited at cathodic potentials by the reduction of sodium cation to sodium, which agreed with those reported in the literature. The chemical dissolution of the deposited metals into the electrolyte was enhanced drastically with increasing melt temperature.
 ###### 
42 As can be seen from Table II, the extent of oxygen removal from the CaNb2O6 film-covered Nb2O5 electrode surfaces was very close after the potentiostatic electrolysis at the applied steps of 0.2 and −1.05V . This demonstrated that the presence of the molten Na-Ca alloys on the oxide electrode surface had little impact on enhancing the overall kinetics of reduction of solid Nb2O5 in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic. It was evident from Fig. 6c and 6e that the resulting current flows at the step of 0.2 V were much lower than those of −1.05V , implying that the electrodeoxidation process for niobium production can potentially offer significant energy savings compared to the calciothermic reduction process. Furthermore, in the electrodeoxidation process, the chloride anions in the electrolyte were unlikely to discharge at the graphite rod anode since the cell voltages, after considering the IR drop, were chosen to be less than those required to decompose the CaCl2-NaCl electrolyte. The chlorine gas released from the electrolytic cell will cause the environmental concerns.

After the electrodeoxidation, the pellets were simply withdrawn from the melt and allowed to cool. The solidified salts had penetrated throughout the reduced pellets, as observed under SEM, indicating that the melt was within the pores.23, 29 The present studies suggest that the pellets of Nb2O5 should possess the structures with high levels of open porosity to ensure the high rate of electrodeoxidation.
42 The experiments confirmed that a film of the CaNb2O6 formed on the external surfaces of the Nb2O5 pellets in thermally dried and pre-electrolyzed molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic under the conditions employed. This was caused by the chemical interaction between the Nb2O5 and the CaO dissolved in the melt. The oxygen ionization potentials of CaNb2O6 and the various niobium oxides were calculated from the thermodynamic data at 850, 900, and 950°C, respectively. The CV and CA experiments demonstrated that the oxygen ionization of the oxides at the working electrode surface would occur at the potentials at least 0.8 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) less cathodic than that of the Na-Ca alloy deposition from the electrolyte. These findings were consistent with those calculated from the thermodynamic data. An analysis of the CA data and characterizations of the electrode surfaces before and after the CA measurements showed that, at the potential steps of 0.7-0.2 V, the cathodic reaction always started with the oxygen ionization of the formed CaNb2O6 film lasting for up to 30 s, which was governed by the oxygen diffusion within the film toward the CaNb2O6 film-electrolyte interface. The surface characterizations of the electrodes after the CA experiments also revealed that there existed a marked dependence of the morphologies, compositions, and phases on the imposed potential steps, and that the calcium cations present in the electrolyte had been electrochemically intercalated into the Nb2O5 structure at the surface at relatively less cathodic potentials than that of the sodium deposition from the electrolyte. The present results indicated that the application of sufficiently cathodic potential steps that caused the molten Na-Ca alloys to deposit on the oxide electrode surface and the calciothermic reduction to occur had little improvement in the overall kinetics of reduction of solid Nb2O5 in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic. The main reaction remained the electrodeoxidation reaction.

43 The electrochemical properties of pure CaCl2 , NaCl , and a CaCl2-NaCl eutectic have been evaluated from the thermodynamic data at 685-950°C. The study showed that the deposition of the liquid sodium from molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic occurs at less cathodic potentials than those of the molten Na-Ca alloys over the temperature range investigated. The electrochemistry of thermally dried and pre-electrolyzed CaCl2-NaCl eutectic melt was studied experimentally using cyclic voltammetry. The cyclic voltammograms of a molybdenum electrode showed that the window was limited at cathodic potentials by the reduction of sodium cation to sodium, which agreed with those reported in the literature. The chemical dissolution of the deposited metals into the electrolyte was enhanced drastically with increasing melt temperature.

44 The experiments confirmed that a film of the CaNb2O6 formed on the external surfaces of the Nb2O5 pellets in thermally dried and pre-electrolyzed molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic under the conditions employed. This was caused by the chemical interaction between the Nb2O5 and the CaO dissolved in the melt. The oxygen ionization potentials of CaNb2O6 and the various niobium oxides were calculated from the thermodynamic data at 850, 900, and 950°C, respectively. The CV and CA experiments demonstrated that the oxygen ionization of the oxides at the working electrode surface would occur at the potentials at least 0.8 V vs (Na+,Ca2+)∕(Na-Ca) less cathodic than that of the Na-Ca alloy deposition from the electrolyte. These findings were consistent with those calculated from the thermodynamic data. An analysis of the CA data and characterizations of the electrode surfaces before and after the CA measurements showed that, at the potential steps of 0.7-0.2 V, the cathodic reaction always started with the oxygen ionization of the formed CaNb2O6 film lasting for up to 30 s, which was governed by the oxygen diffusion within the film toward the CaNb2O6 film-electrolyte interface.

45 Niobium has been used mainly as an addition agent to construction steels and as an alloying component of heat-resistant alloys and many high-strength low-alloy steels. It is also employed in the fields of applied superconductivity and structural materials production. 1 – 3 At present, the existing commercial processes for producing niobium metal include the aluminothermic reduction of Nb2O5 , the carbothermic reduction of Nb2O5 , and the sodium reduction of K2NbF7 . 4 – 10 In addition, a number of the processes based upon electrolytic reduction of Nb2O5 , NbCl5 , and K2NbF7 in molten salts have been also investigated extensively, although as yet none of these electrowinning processes has been commercialized for niobium production. 11 – 18 In the electrolytic processes, the compounds of niobium ( Nb2O5 , NbCl5 , and K2NbF7 ) dissolve as a source of niobium ions in either chlorides with and without additions of CaO or K2NbF7 -containing fluorides, or chloride-fluoride mixtures. The melts are used as the electrolytes in the electrowinning of niobium. Considerable efforts have also been made to study the mechanism of the electrochemical reduction of the niobium compounds. The common feature to the proposed mechanism involved in the electrowinning of niobium from the above electrolytes is the stepwise reduction, which may be summarized as follows The detailed sequences above depend mainly on which of the niobium compounds is used as well as on the electrolysis conditions. 12 , 13 , 17 , 18

46 A new concept termed electrodeoxidation at a solid cathode was recently proposed for the electrochemical removal of oxygen from solid metal oxides and metallic solutions by electrolysis in a fused salt. 19 , 20 The feasibility of the concept of electrodeoxidation was confirmed experimentally by the voltammetric studies of direct electrochemical reduction of solid TiO2 to titanium and of oxygen removal from the O-Ti binary system in molten CaCl2 . 20 , 21 The method of direct electrochemical reduction based on the oxygen ionization concept has been used to reduce many metal oxides or oxide mixtures to their metals or alloys. 22 – 27 More recently, the method was applied to prepare successfully niobium powders and sponges directly from solid Nb2O5 by constant voltage electrolysis in molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic over the temperature range 850-950°C in an argon atmosphere. 28 – 31 In these studies, the constant cell voltages (3.0-3.2 V) were chosen such that, by taking the infrared (IR) drop into account, the decomposition of molten CaCl2-NaCl eutectic was unlikely to occur but the reduction of various oxides at the cathode could take place. Under such conditions, no chlorine anions in the melt could be discharged at the anode. The preferred cathodic reaction was the oxygen ionization at the oxide cathode, which may be expressed by Reaction 2 was termed electrodeoxidation of Nb2O5 . 26 , 27 It is apparent that the cathodic processes occurring during the electrowinning of niobium (Reaction 1 ) and during the electrodeoxidation of the oxides (Reaction 2 ) are fundamentally different. It is worth mentioning that, in 1999, Okabe and co-workers explored an electronically mediated reaction (EMR) route for producing niobium powders in CaCl2 and CaCl2-NaCl melts using calcium and calcium alloys or magnesium and magnesium alloys as the reductants, respectively. 32 , 33 The metallothermic reduction of solid Nb2O5 by the reductants was carried out at 900°C, with the Nb2O5 separated from the reductants by the molten chlorides According to the concept of EMR, Reaction 3 was readily broken down into two electrochemical steps The electrons for Reaction 2 at the cathode were provided externally by a powder supply or potentiostat, whereas the electrons for Reaction 4b , which took the same form as Reaction 2 , were given by the calcium in a Ca-Al-Ni alloy or the magnesium in a Mg-Ni alloy due to Reaction 4a through a reactor or electronically conductive molten salts. Although the Nb2O5 was used as the starting material, the work reported in this paper did not employ metal reductants (Ca or Mg) for the reduction of solid Nb2O5 28 – 31 The use of the metal reductants would obviously increase the overall cost for niobium powder production in the EMR process. 32 , 33
