The probe-working electrode Volta potential difference was mapped in situ under load. It was found that the influence of elastic deformation on the potential was small. Plastic deformation decreased the potential of steel by 150–300 mV, whereas the relaxation of the load from the plastic domain increased the Volta potential. However, some locations, which can contain residual stress, remained at low potential. The pre-strained surfaces were characterized by X-ray Photo Electronic Spectroscopy and by Atomic Force Microscopy. Distribution of the capacitance across strained and strain-free surfaces was studied by LEIS in boric/borate electrolyte. The plastic stress increases the capacitance and decreases the ability of the steels to passivate the surface indicating that emerging of pile-ups of dislocations create defective oxide films.

from test: 1 Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) is a well-known complex corrosion process caused by the combination of stress and corrosion, which can lead to wear, cracking or fatigue failures. In many cases, the residual stress from plastic deformation or wear accelerates the corrosion rate.1 In the classic film rupture model, tensile stress breaks the passive film creating anodic locations at the bottom of the crack,2,3 which propagates through an activation/passivation process. This model was developed to the “slip dissolution-film rupture model” pointing out the importance of formation of dislocations and metal dissolution through dislocation slip lines.3,4 The slip dissolution-film rupture model of crack advance was discussed in details previously.5 This model can predict the crack growth rate for the stainless steels, nickel alloys, and low-alloy steels in high temperature water.6

from test: 2 The effect of the yielding on the rate of dissolution of many metals was found to be much pronounced in comparison with the influence of elastic deformation.7 The dissolution rate showed a marked rise at the beginning of the plastic region that is asymptotic with increasing strain. Similar effects of plastic deformation on the anodic current during dissolution were also found for stainless steels.8 To explain this mechanical- electrochemical effect, both the increase of dissolution rate at slip edges and dislocations, and the increase of surface roughness from plastic deformation were pointed out.8 On the other hand, the selective slip dissolution can be ascribed to the local excess of Gibbs potential,7,8 thus contradicting earlier works. Hoar9 has shown that both enthalpy and entropy of activation were not significantly altered by cold work, which meant that the free energy of activation for anodic reaction should remain almost constant. A calorimetric study10 showed that residual energy from cold work was less than 7 calories per gram without any significant impact on Gibbs potential during the deformation.

The dissolution rate in acidic electrolyte was found to be proportional to the dislocation density created by plastic strain. As a result, surface roughness associated with emergence of slip bands promoted the dissolution process in relation with the electronic state of the surface.13 The activation energy of the dissolution process can be influenced by long-range internal stresses due to the heterogeneous distribution of dislocations, evolution of kink density and emergence of the lines of the dislocations, whereas plasticity and formation of dislocations or kinks can modify the solid configurational entropy.13 Thus, the activation energy to transfer metallic ions in the electrolyte is decreased by dislocations.

from test: 6 Thus, the stress can decrease the activation energy of anodic dissolution, which was found during the active dissolution of steel. Moreover, in previous studies,19,20 the use of scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) showed that plastic tensile and compressive strain decreased the electrochemical (Volta) potential of stainless steel by 200–300 mV. The measurements were performed in air, thus minimizing the influence of adsorption of ions or the hydrogenation on the potential. The strain-induced drop of the electrochemical potential was explained by the formation of dislocations that broke the oxide film. However, plastic deformation transforms austenite to martensite phase that can also influence the potential.20 Thus, it was important to continue the study and to compare the effect of the stress on the potential of ferritic and austenitic steels. Determination of the potential in the locations containing the residual stress due to previous plastic deformation is also a point of interest. In this work, two complementary local probe techniques with similar level of spatial resolution were used for the characterization of carbon and austenitic steels. SKP was used to measure the electrochemical potential of the surfaces with stress, whereas local electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (LEIS) was used to characterize the passive films in stressed conditions and the ability of these areas to repassivation. The role of the applied stress on the stability of passive oxide film and the reactivity of the stainless steel surface in aqueous electrolyte was studied using local electrochemical techniques in a preliminary investigation.21

from test: 9 SKP is often used for measuring the Volta potential difference with respect to any reference electrode or the electron work function (ewf) with respect to the zero level in vacuum.22 The electrochemical potential of the electrons, α, is defined as the work to remove one mole of electrons from the infinity (i.e. in vacuum) to the Fermi level inside the metallic phase and is given by Eq. 1. where Φ is the ewf, μe is the Fermi level of the electrons in the metal, the Xw is potential drop across metal surface, NA and F are the Avogadro and the Faraday constants.23 Thus, the potential (Φ/e, e being the elementary charge) has bulk and surface contributions. For a metal covered by an oxide film, the potential drop can be expressed as: This equation shows that the contact potential difference between the metal and the oxide is proportional to the difference in Fermi levels of the electrons in the metal (μe) and in the oxide (μox). Fb is the potential drop in the oxide, and βox/air is a contribution accounting for the potential drop of adsorbed molecules on the oxide surface. For an iron oxide film, μox is governed by the ratio of activities [Fe3+] / [Fe2+] whereas for stainless film, both chromium and iron species have to be taken into account.24 In a corrosive environment, the SKP measures the potential corresponding to the corrosion potential.25 In dry air conditions, the measurement relates to the potential of steel in the passive state controlled by red-ox potential of the surface species.24,26 In addition, it was shown that the potential of stainless steel is influenced by the oxide film thickness,20 the potential being more positive for a thicker film. Thus, probe-working electrode Volta potential difference relates to electrochemical potential of the working electrode given relative to a reference electrode.

from test: 17 Figure 3a shows the distribution of the potential across a carbon steel sample under the load of 310 MPa. This is higher than the yield strength (285 MPa) and the measurement of elongation gives the plastic strain close to 10%. SKP showed the area of low potential of 200 mV in the notch relative to the surrounding surface. Another sample was strained to 15% (330 MPa) and the potential drop in the notch area compared with the surrounding was about 100–150 mV (Figure 3b). Logically, it can be expected that increase of the strain will proportionally decrease the potential. However, the experimental data (Figures 3a, 3b) showed that the dependence is more complex. The potential can be a function of the thickness of oxide layer and the rate of the loading that can influence on the dislocations pattern (e.g. formation of the cells with high plastic strain11,13). However, these parameters were not controlled in this study. The formation of slip bands in the strained area is shown by AFM topography in Figure 3c.

from test: 20 The potential distribution was measured 1 month after unloading. Long-time exposure in a dry air atmosphere led to an increase of the Volta potential to a level 50–80 mV more positive relative to the area surrounding the notch. A possible explanation is that the relaxation of the pre-stressed oxide film resulted in an increase of the oxide film thickness, which is in line with XPS measurements. On the other hand, healing of the defects in the freshly formed oxide by oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ may have also played a role and increased the potential of the gauge section during ageing.

On the other hand, healing of the defects in the freshly formed oxide by oxidation of Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ may have also played a role and increased the potential of the gauge section during ageing.

from test: 21 The effect of the stress was studied by local electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in boric/borate aqueous electrolyte. It is possible to compare the impedance for the strained and non-strained areas. The carbon steel sample was strained using the constant load cell and the stress was controlled by a load sensor. The local impedance was monitored by performing a measurement at a single location at the center of notch simultaneously with the global impedance, which corresponds to an averaged value over the whole exposed surface to the electrolyte. Figure 5 shows that the load (300 MPa) increased the local capacitance from 2 to 3.4 μF/cm2. In first approximation, this increase of capacitance can be seen as a thinning of the passive film when increasing the mechanical stress. A similar effect can be the result of increasing the real surface of the working electrode, for instance due to increasing of the surface roughness.

Conversely, to the local capacitance, the global measurement shows a constant value of the mean capacitance whatever the mechanical load. Thus, the local variation of the impedance due to the strength has only a light contribution on the global EIS response indicating that the local variation of the capacitance is localized above the notch area only, and can be monitored only with the help of a spatially resolved techniques.

from test: 23 The open circuit potential (OCP), which was monitored using an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, decreased due to straining from −0.12 to −0.38 V/SHE. This effect was observed only after reaching the yield stress. A negative shift of the OCP can be related to the formation of defects or to the decrease of the oxide film thickness due to local breakdown in the film. Interestingly, the OCP value, which is a global measurement, appears to be sensitive to local modifications of the oxide film.

After 12 h of exposure, the OCP increased by 40 mV to reach −0.34 V/SHE and the local capacitance decreased from 3.4 to 2.5 μF/cm2. Thus, defects in the oxide film repair and in absence of loading the surface can partially re-passivate. The LEIS data in electrolyte are in line with SKP measurements in air (Figure 4A).

from test: 26 The thickness of the oxide film on 301 LN influences the potential;20 the thinner the oxide layer, the more negative the potential. In addition, the composition and oxidation state can also influence the potential drop across the oxide film. Thus, grazing angle XPS was used to analyze the influence of previously applied strain on the properties of surface oxide (Figure 8). The reference spectrum was obtained above the non-deformed regions, i.e. on the same specimen but outside of the notch domain. The results showed that tensile plastic strain decreased only slightly the thickness of chromium oxide film and increased slightly the thickness of the iron oxide layer (Table III). Moreover, when the strain was applied in the air atmosphere, no modification of the [Fe3+]/[Fe2+] ratio was found (Figure 8). It is important to note that XPS measurements were carried about 1 month after the sample straining. During exposure in dry air, a slow potential increase for the area with residual stress was observed. During this time, the relaxation of the surface oxide at the pre-strained locations can take place.

from test: 27 Comparing the influence of elastic and plastic deformation on the potential for carbon and stainless steels, it is possible to point out that yielding decreases the potential. The main effect of the yielding is the formation of dislocations that can influence the properties of the surface of steel electrodes. Unloading of the samples increases the potential for both steels. However, for stainless steel this process is slower than for carbon steel. A possible explanation is that on carbon steel surface the defects in the oxide film are repaired due to contact with air oxygen. Stainless steel is more stable to oxidation by air and thickening of the oxide in defects is a relatively slow process.

from test: 36 SKP measures the Volta potential (Φ/e ) in air close to the metal surface. On an absolute potential scale, the potential of the metal covered by semiconducting oxide film can be expressed as:24,38 Where μeM is the chemical potential of the electron in the metal bulk, Δχox - the potential drop in the oxide film (metal-oxide interface) and Δχair - the potential drop in the air gap. Eq. 3 shows the relationship between the measured potential and the corresponding capacitances (Cox, Cair) and the charges stored at this interface (q). Due to electroneutrality, the charges of adsorbed species (e.g. O2−) are compensated by the same amount of charges in the oxide (e.g. holes) resulting in band bending of both electronic and valence bands in the oxide. The capacitance of the oxide film is reciprocal to the potential drop. Thus, SKP and EIS (or LEIS) measurements are interrelated and can be used in a complementary fashion to evaluate the effect of the mechanical stress on the properties of the steel surface.

The same potential corresponds to the real free energy of the electron at the Fermi level of the metal and can be measured using SKP.

The stress can influence the chemical potential of the electron in the metal (μeM /e) or the potential drop across the metal/oxide/air interface (Eqs. 1 & 3). The calculation within the self-consisting Kohn–Sham method for elastically deformed metal crystals showed that tensile strain decreased the density of the atoms packing and concentration of the electrons that can decrease ewf in the range 30–40 mV for Al and Cu (111 and 100 planes).39 The stress can influence the potential drop across metal/vacuum interface due to the change of the distance between surface atoms, while the change of the chemical potential of the electron (Fermi energy) in the metal bulk was negligible. Thus, the properties of the material bulk were not altered by the stress, which is in agreement with calorimetry measurements and thermodynamic definition of Hoar.9 It can be assumed that the stress mainly influenced the potential drop across metal/oxide and oxide air/interfaces. The potential mainly decreased when the specimen was loaded over the yield strength, leading to the formation of dislocations. Plastic strain in the range of 10–15% decreased the potential of 200–300 mV for 301 LN steel and around 200 mV for the carbon steel.

New surfaces can result in a lowering of the oxide thickness that can play an important role in the initiation of stress corrosion cracking of stainless steels.40,41 It is thus possible that areas with low oxide thickness are created under stress due to the oxide film rupture or emerging of the slip bands.42 It is gradually different from the roughness created by the grinding (Figure 9).

from Soup: 45 Local probe techniques – SKP in air and LEIS in the aqueous electrolyte – demonstrated that residual stress decreased the ability of the steel to passivate the surface either in the air or in the electrolyte.
