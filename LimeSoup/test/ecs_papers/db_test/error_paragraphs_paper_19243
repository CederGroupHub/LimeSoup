from Soup: 1 Recently, due to the miniature of the flip-chip solder bumps, EM (Electromigration) has become an urgent reliability issue for flip-chip technology. By 2013, the current density in the flip-chip solder bumps will increase to the order of 10 5 Amp/cm 2 . 1 , 2 Under such high current density, several EM-induced reliability issues would likely occur in the flip-chip Sn-based solder bumps, such as, EM voiding at the cathode solder joint interface, and EM-induced Cu bond-pad dissolution. 3 – 10 The latter, EM-induced Cu-pad dissolution, would cause the serious reduction of solder joint strength. Particularly, while the Pb-free solders are implemented as the solder bumps, the EM-induced Cu-pad dissolution would become more serious due to the larger Cu solubility in Sn-based solders. 9 – 11 Up to now, researchers believe that there are two possible driving forces for the EM-induced Cu-pad dissolution; (1) the direct EM force imposed on the Cu atoms in the cathode interfacial Cu-Sn compound layer and (2) the Cu chemical potential difference in the solder matrix and in the interfacial cathode Cu-Sn compound layer. 7 , 8 The detail mechanism of EM-induced Cu-pad dissolution is still not clear. In this present work, by testing a T-shaped solder joint structure under current stressing, the detail mechanism and dominant driving force of the EM-induced Cu-pad dissolution is investigated. By separating the above two driving forces of the EM-induced Cu-pad dissolution, the Z * of Cu atoms in Sn would be able to be determined.

The three discrete Cu trace lines are patterned in the T-shape formation. The width and depth of the Cu trace line are 150 μm and 50 μm, respectively. Reflow pure Sn solder to join the T-shaped Cu trace lines at 250°C. The reflowing time to join the T-shaped Cu trace lines is 60 seconds. The length of the Sn solder joint is 600 μm. A schematic diagram of T-shaped structure for EM test with Sn triple-junction solder joint on PCB is shown in Fig. 1 . A constant current density of 1.5 × 10 4 A/cm 2 was applied along the two lined-up Cu legs at 130°C, as indicated in Fig. 1 . For the measurement of the consumed thickness of the Cu substrate, we use the image integral software (Optimas) to calculate the total Cu-consumed area ( A ) in the Cu substrate. By dividing A with the length of the solder/Cu interface, then, the average consumed thickness of the Cu substrate can be obtained. Note that no current flows through the third Cu leg, which is vertical to the electrical current flow (denoted as “no-EM interface” in the following text).

from Soup: 6 The other force driving the Cu atoms in the Cu-Sn compound layer into the Sn joint is resulted from the deficient Cu solubility in the Sn solder near the interfacial Cu-Sn compound layer. 9 – 11 Typically, as Sn solder joins with Cu, the Sn solder would dissolve a certain amount of Cu solutes to establish the equilibrium Cu solubility in the Sn solder joint. As the current stressing through the Sn solder joint, the dissolved Cu atoms in the Sn solder joint will experience EM force and be electomigrated toward the anode side, which is denoted as the EM Cu flux ( J Cu,EM ) in Sn. The magnitudes of J Cu,EM can be expressed by the theoretical EM flux equation where D Cu is the Cu diffusivity in Sn, k is Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, Z * is the effective charge number of Cu in Sn, e is the electron charge, and E is the applied electrical field. As the Cu solute atoms in the Sn solder joint electromigrated away from the cathode joint interface toward the anode joint interface, the Cu solubility in the Sn solder matrix near the Cu/Sn cathode interface would drop below the equilibrium Cu solubility. As a result, a deficient Cu solubility in the Sn solder joint occurs, which causes the Cu atoms in the interfacial Cu-Sn compound layer dissolving into the Sn solder matrix (defined as EM-induced Cu flux, ( J Cu,diss. )) to restore the equilibrium Cu solubility in the Sn solder matrix. The EM-induced Cu flux ( J Cu,diss . ) depends on the difference between the in-situ Cu solubility ( C in-situ ) in the Sn solder joint and the equilibrium Cu solubility in Sn ( C equil. ). So, the EM-induced Cu flux ( J Cu,diss. ) can be equated as: 9 , 11 , 12 where k is the dissolution constant, C equil is the equilibrium Cu solubility in Sn C in-situ is in-situ Cu solubility in Sn.

from Soup: 7 Fig. 2a shows the SEM image on the as-made triple-junction Sn solder joint. Figs. 2b – 2d illustrate all the Cu fluxes at the three interfaces of the triple-junction Sn solder joint. It has been reported that, under current stressing, the cathode interfacial Cu-Sn compound would dissolve into the Sn solder joint and caused the EM-induced consumption in the Cu pad. 9 , 13 , 14 In the following, we made an attempt to decouple the individual contributions of the EM-driven Cu flux ( J Cu,IMCs ) and the EM-induced Cu flux ( J Cu,diss ) at the cathode interfacial Cu-Sn compound layer. As shown in Fig. 2 , since no electrical current flows across the no-EM interface, there is no EM-driven Cu flux ( J Cu,IMCs ) would occur in the Cu-Sn compound layer at the no-EM interface. Yet, we note that the electron flow would still stress through the Sn solder joint above the no-EM interface. So, the Cu solubility ( C in-situ ) in the Sn joint above the no-EM interface would be below the equilibrium Cu solubility in Sn ( C equil . ). Consequently, the deficient Cu solubility ( C equil. – C in-situ ) in the Sn solder joint would drive the Cu atoms in the interfacial Cu-Sn compound layer at the no-EM interface dissolving into the Sn solder joint. Again, please be noted that the dissolution of the Cu-Sn compound layers at the cathode interface attributes to both EM-driven Cu flux and EM-induced Cu flux. And, only the EM-induced Cu flux contributes to the dissolution of the Cu-Sn compound layer at the no-EM interface.

The EM-induced Cu flux (JCu,diss.) depends on the difference between the in-situ Cu solubility (Cin-situ) in the Sn solder joint and the equilibrium Cu solubility in Sn (Cequil.). So, the EM-induced Cu flux (JCu,diss.) can be equated as:9,11,12 where k is the dissolution constant, Cequil is the equilibrium Cu solubility in Sn Cin-situ is in-situ Cu solubility in Sn.
from Soup: 8 Figs. 3a – 3e show the SEM images on the cathode interface of the triple-junction Sn solder joint with different current-stressing time under a constant current density of 15000 A/cm 2 at 130°C. As shown in Fig. 3a , we can see many Cu-Sn compound particles precipitated in the as-made Sn solder joint. After 60-hours current stressing, as seen in Fig. 3b , the Cu-Sn compound particles in the as-joined solder joint were depleted completely by the J Cu,EM (equation 2 ), which also means that the Cu solubility in the Sn solder joint is at a very low level, (or could be near zero). Thus, the Cu atoms in the interfacial Cu-Sn compound layers at the cathode interface would start dissolving into the Sn solder joint. As shown in Figs. 3c – 3e , with prolonged current-stressing, a clear Cu consumption is observed in the cathode Cu leg. The dash line at the cathode interface in Figs. 3c – 3e represents the original position of the cathode interface of the 60-hours current-stressed sample. Figs. 3f – 3j show the SEM images on the no-EM interface of the triple-junction Sn solder joint with different current-stressing time under a constant current density of 15000 A/cm 2 at 130°C. The dash line in Figs. 3h – 3j indicates the original position of the no-EM interface of the 60-hours current-stressed sample. With prolonged current-stressing time, an obvious Cu consumption at the no-EM interface is observed. The consumed-Cu thickness at the cathode interface and at the no-EM interface can be measured from Figs. 3 . Thus, using the measured consumed-Cu thickness, the consumed Cu thickness at the cathode interface and at the no-EM interface can be calculated out and plotted in Fig. 4 against the current stressing time. To eliminate the effect of the pre-existed Cu-Sn compound precipitates in the as-jointed Sn solder joint, we only take the consumed Cu thickness at the joint interfaces of the current-stressed samples after 60-hours current-stressing time. From the above discussion, we can assume that the consumed Cu at the cathode interface and at the no-EM interface should be collected and form the Cu-Sn compound layer (majority is Cu 6 Sn 5 phase) at the anode interface. Here, we measured the thickness of the anode Cu-Sn compound layer and converted the measured Cu-Sn compound thickness to the equivalent Cu thickness, as seen in the blue-triangle markers in Fig. 4 . We found that the equivalent Cu thickness at the anode side is close to the sum of the consumed Cu thickness at the cathode interface and at the no-EM interface. Indeed, it shows that the Cu is mass conservative in the studied system.

It has been reported that, under current stressing, the cathode interfacial Cu-Sn compound would dissolve into the Sn solder joint and caused the EM-induced consumption in the Cu pad.9,13,14 In the following, we made an attempt to decouple the individual contributions of the EM-driven Cu flux (JCu,IMCs) and the EM-induced Cu flux (JCu,diss) at the cathode interfacial Cu-Sn compound layer. As shown in Fig. 2, since no electrical current flows across the no-EM interface, there is no EM-driven Cu flux (JCu,IMCs) would occur in the Cu-Sn compound layer at the no-EM interface. Yet, we note that the electron flow would still stress through the Sn solder joint above the no-EM interface. So, the Cu solubility (Cin-situ) in the Sn joint above the no-EM interface would be below the equilibrium Cu solubility in Sn (Cequil.). Consequently, the deficient Cu solubility (Cequil. – Cin-situ) in the Sn solder joint would drive the Cu atoms in the interfacial Cu-Sn compound layer at the no-EM interface dissolving into the Sn solder joint. Again, please be noted that the dissolution of the Cu-Sn compound layers at the cathode interface attributes to both EM-driven Cu flux and EM-induced Cu flux. And, only the EM-induced Cu flux contributes to the dissolution of the Cu-Sn compound layer at the no-EM interface.
from Soup: 9 Linear relationship is observed for the both curves in Fig. 4 . The slopes of the two linear curves in Fig. 4 represent the Cu fluxes at the cathode interface and at the no-EM interface, respectively. Note that the dissolution of the Cu-Sn compound layers at the cathode interface attributes to both EM-driven Cu flux and EM-induced Cu flux. And, only the EM-induced Cu flux contributes to the dissolution of the Cu-Sn compound layer at the no-EM interface. So, the difference in the Cu fluxes at the cathode interface and at the no-EM interface should be the EM-driven Cu flux in the cathode Cu-Sn compound layer. Thus, based on the above discussion, the EM-driven Cu flux in the cathode Cu-Sn compound layer can be calculated to be 4.7 ×10 12 atoms/cm 2 sec. From the SEM images in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 , we know that all the interfacial compound layers at the cathode interface and the no-EM interface are mainly Cu 6 Sn 5 compound phase. The Cu 3 Sn layer is very thin.
