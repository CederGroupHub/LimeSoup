from test: 0 The Nernst-Planck mass-transport treatment is extended to electrolytic multicomponent systems including mixtures of strong electrolytes, weak electrolytes, and hydrolysis reactions, in dilute, stagnant solutions. The extension is presented in the form of theorems of electrochemical mass transport. The validity and usefulness of the theorems have been demonstrated in their application to two important and complex systems, namely, electrodialysis at larger than limiting currents, and corrosion of ferrous alloys in waters at high temperature and pressure. These applications are briefly summarized here. The theorems are useful for treatment of electrochemical mass transport in boundary layers that can be approximated by stagnant layers.

from test: 1 In a dilute aqueous electrolytic solution subjected to the passage of an electrical current, the flux of each species at any given location x , y , z , may be represented by2 where j=1,2,3,…,n , Jj is the flux vector of the jth species (molecm−2s−1) , Cj its concentration (molcm−3) , Zj its electrical charge (mol-equiv mol−1 , positive for cations, negative for anions), V is the fluid velocity vector (cms−1) , F the Faraday constant (9.65×104C[mol-equiv]−1) , R the universal gas constant (8.3143JK−1mol−1) , T the absolute temperature (K), ϕ the electrical potential (V), and Dj the ionic diffusion coefficient of the jth species (cm2s−1) , is defined by the Nernst–Einstein relationwhere Uj is the electrical mobility (cm2molJ−1s−1) of the jth species. For neutral species, Dj is the diffusion coefficient per Fick’s first diffusion law.
from Soup: 1 The mathematical solution of electrochemical mass-transport problems usually involves a physico/mathematical analysis of the defined system, culminating in a set of simplifying assumptions, partial differential equations (PDEs), boundary conditions (BCs), and initial conditions (ICs). Then the equations are manipulated to obtain a set less difficult to solve. Having to go through the conversion of the PDEs for every problem of electrochemical mass transport is laborious and sometimes fastidious. Additionally, errors often find their way in the process and require additional time and effort in revising and correcting. Electrochemists could save much time and effort solving problems by application of the theorems, like mechanical engineers do in solving their problems by using the theorems of geometry instead of deriving from scratch the particular results for each and every specific mechanical problem.

from test: 2 The first term in Eq. 1 is the convective contribution to the flux. The second term is the contribution by diffusion relative to the moving fluid and due to the concentration gradient (∇Cj) , and the third term is the contribution by electromigration relative to the moving fluid and due to the electrical field (∇ϕ) .
from Soup: 2 Over many years following the extension of the Nernst-Planck mass-transport treatment to electrolytic multicomponent systems, 1 the author developed further the mathematical treatment of mass transport in dilute electrolytic solutions, and the material developed reached a critical mass allowing its organization and formalization in the form of theorems. This work proposes 12 theorems and 9 corollaries of electrochemical mass transport in dilute stagnant solutions, with their proof. The theorems are based on the Nernst-Planck flux equation. We hope that this work is only a beginning and will inspire others to develop more theorems.
 ###### 
from test: 3 In a stagnant solution, the first term vanishes and Eq. 1 reduces to the Nernst-Planck flux equation in vectorial form. The material conservation equation for each species iswhere qj is the local rate of production (molcm−3s−1) of the jth species at location x,y,z , at time t , negative rate if species j is being consumed, locally.
from Soup: 3 Newman reviews a general form of the Nernst-Planck flux equation, its applicability, and its limitations. 2 Newman concludes: “Nevertheless, (the Nernst-Planck flux) equation … is recommended for general use because it is prevalent, both explicitly and implicitly, in the electrochemical literature and because it gives a good account of the physical processes involved without excessive complication. One should remember that it is strictly valid only in dilute solutions.” 2 Additionally, “Transport theory valid for dilute solutions has been applied fruitfully to electrochemical systems.” 2 The wide success of the Nernst-Planck flux equation is not explained. This wide success is found in cases of only one single independent driving force, i.e., only one single driving force externally applied. In cases with more than one independent driving force, the Nernst-Planck equation is expected to be inapplicable. For example, when an electrical potential difference is imposed over an aqueous electrolytic solution, both an electrical field distribution and a concentration gradient distribution develop and are functions of the electrical potential difference imposed on the solution. Only that potential difference is independent and the Nernst-Planck equation applies. Similarly for the case of diffusion, where a concentration difference (instead of an electrical potential difference) is applied over the electrolytic solution, the Nernst–Planck equation works well. However, if both an electrical potential difference and a concentration difference are imposed independently over the solution, then the Nernst-Planck does not apply. Instead, one must use the equations of coupled flows from the theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. 3 – 5

Rewriting Eq. 6 asshows that the electroneutrality equation, Eq. 4, remains an excellent approximation,2 even when ∇2ϕ is appreciable, over a wide range of concentrations and nonuniform electrical fields.
from Soup: 4 The theorems should prove useful to workers and students of electrochemical transport problems, especially for problems involving electrolytic multicomponent systems. The validity and usefulness of the theorems have been demonstrated in their application to two important industrial cases, namely, electrodialysis of aqueous salt solutions at electrical current above so-called limiting current densities, and corrosion of steels in waters at high temperature and pressure. The results of these applications are summarized after the theorems. The author hopes that these theorems may be useful to the readers as well, and may inspire others to develop more theorems and their proof and that, eventually, they may all be incorporated into the electrochemistry curriculum.

Returning to Eq. 23, m particular cases are derived by considering all parent electrolyte concentrations except one equal to zero.

As an example, acetic acid (CH3COOH) dissociates into an acetate anion (CH3COO−) and a hydrogen cation (H+) as follows: CH3COOH⇌CH3COO−+H+ . The two arrows with half heads in opposite directions indicates that some acetic acid molecules remain associated and that there is equilibrium between the two forms of the molecules (associated and dissociated).

from Soup: 74 In dilute aqueous solutions, weak electrolytes only partly dissociate into ions. As an example, acetic acid (CH3COOH) dissociates into an acetate anion (CH3COO−) and a hydrogen cation (H+) as follows: CH3COOH⇌CH3COO−+H+ . The two arrows with half heads in opposite directions indicates that some acetic acid molecules remain associated and that there is equilibrium between the two forms of the molecules (associated and dissociated). Strong electrolytes such as (CaCl2) are not excluded here, because the accompanying hydrolytic reaction can be treated in this section.
 ###### 
from test: 75 Notice that in Eq. 30 the diffusion constant of the strong electrolyte is built of the diffusion constants of the constituting ions, whereas in Eq. 65 the diffusion constant of the weak electrolyte is that of the undissociated electrolyte. However, at infinite dilution even the weak electrolyte dissociates completely, which shows that the relation Eq. 26 between the diffusion coefficients of the neutral species and those of its ions remains valid for weak electrolytes. In general, Eq. 65 is not linear because the degree of dissociation α depends on the concentrations.
from Soup: 75 Representing by Cac the concentration of the acetic acid, then the dissociated fraction concentration is Cd=αCac , where α is the fraction dissociated. Then the associated fraction concentration is Ca=(1-α)Cac . By virtue of the equilibrium between the two fractions, their concentrations are related. In the example illustrated here, the relation is expressed as: Kac=a+∗a−∕aa , where a+ , a− , and aa are the thermodynamic activities of the cation, the anion, and the associated species, respectively, in the solution, and Kac is the acetic acid equilibrium constant, also called dissociation constant. In sufficiently dilute solution, each activity is equal to its corresponding concentration, yielding Equations such as Eq. 53 must be added to the system of Eq. 4, 9, 10 Because Eq. 53 is not linear (contains products of concentrations), it makes the whole system nonlinear. Then, we must return to Eq. 18 , and solutions of that system cannot be combined linearly to produce new solutions, making the mathematical analysis of dilute aqueous solutions of weak electrolytes more complicated and difficult than for strong electrolytes.

from Soup: 78 We return to the fundamental equation, Eq. 18 , which remains valid for a mixture of any electrolytes, including weak electrolytes. In the dilute solution of a mixture of weak electrolytes, those electrolytes dissociate to various extents. The dissociated fraction of each parent electrolyte makes a contribution Cil to the concentration Ci of each ith ionic species and is related to the concentration Cl of that parent electrolyte by where νil is the stoichiometric number of the ith species resulting from the dissociation of one molecule of the parent electrolyte l , and αl is its degree of dissociation.

from test: 111 At relatively low current densities, with increasing current the concentration gradients increase, the salt concentration at the depleted interface decreases, and conversely, at the enriched interface. As the salt concentration at the depleted interface becomes comparable with that of the water ions, the latter participate substantially in the electrochemical mass transport, both migrating away from that interface. The hydroxyl anions leave through the AEM and reach the right side channel, forming there a base with the salt cation; fewer hydrogen cations migrate away into the left channel. Consequently, water at the left interface dissociates into an equal number of hydroxyls and protons and maintains the water/water-ion equilibrium and causing at that interface, an accumulation of protons, which form an acid there, with the salt anion. Thus, the acid-base generation reaction is the reverse of acid-base neutralization, and for potassium chloride as an example, may be expressed as KCl+H2O=HCl+KOH . Thus, the solutions are mixtures of two strong and electrically neutral electrolytes (KCl+HCl on one side, and KCl+KOH on the other side) and one weak neutral electrolyte (water).

In that cell the membrane was 1cm on the short side ×5cm along the flow channel, which was 1.2cm wide. The liquid flow speeds (0.22−1.2cm∕s) were slower than those in full-scale electrodialysis units in the industry. The Reynolds numbers ranged from 24 to 133, indicating a laminar flow regime. The mathematical treatment of the electrochemical transport on the enriched side of the membrane and in the bulk of the depleted side was straightforward. The electrochemical transport in the idealized Nernst stagnant layer on the depleted side, which includes the acid-base generation, was more complex and is considered in the following. Even so, the actual solution is too long to include here. The reader interested in more details is therefore referred to the sources.1, 17 Only the results are summarized below:

Referring to the AEM in Fig. 3 , fewer anions migrate from the left channel to the left interface than pass through the membrane from the left interface to the right interface. Also, fewer migrate away from the right interface. Therefore, the left interface is depleted of anions and the right interface is enriched. Correspondingly, cations migrate from the right channel to the right interface, and about an equal amount of cations migrate away from the left interface into the left channel. The net result is a decrease in salt concentration at the left interface and an increase at the right interface, followed by salt diffusion establishing concentration distributions and gradients. These and related phenomena are defined as concentration polarization.

from test: 115 Acid-base generation starts as a heterogeneous process at the solution/membrane interface on the depleted side where the water dissociation is driven by the depletion of the water ions at that interface. Such depletion can proceed appreciably only when, at that interface, the concentration of all ions is not too large compared to (KW)1∕2 , where KW is the water-ions product constant. Such a picture had been postulated before;18 however, it is only part of a more complex picture, which had not been described in the literature.

The hydroxyl anions leave through the AEM and reach the right side channel, forming there a base with the salt cation; fewer hydrogen cations migrate away into the left channel. Consequently, water at the left interface dissociates into an equal number of hydroxyls and protons and maintains the water/water-ion equilibrium and causing at that interface, an accumulation of protons, which form an acid there, with the salt anion. Thus, the acid-base generation reaction is the reverse of acid-base neutralization, and for potassium chloride as an example, may be expressed as KCl+H2O=HCl+KOH . Thus, the solutions are mixtures of two strong and electrically neutral electrolytes ( KCl+HCl on one side, and KCl+KOH on the other side) and one weak neutral electrolyte (water).

from test: 116 In the depleted solution layer adjacent to an AEM (and/or in the depleted layer adjacent to a CEM), the fluxes of the water ions tend to disturb the solution local water/water-ion equilibrium. This disturbance drives local water dissociation to maintain the ionic product constant, i.e., drives acid-base generation in the liquid phase too.
from Soup: 116 We solved the steady-state system of an experimental cell for which data was available. In that cell the membrane was 1cm on the short side ×5cm along the flow channel, which was 1.2cm wide. The liquid flow speeds (0.22−1.2cm∕s) were slower than those in full-scale electrodialysis units in the industry. The Reynolds numbers ranged from 24 to 133, indicating a laminar flow regime. The mathematical treatment of the electrochemical transport on the enriched side of the membrane and in the bulk of the depleted side was straightforward. The electrochemical transport in the idealized Nernst stagnant layer on the depleted side, which includes the acid-base generation, was more complex and is considered in the following. Even so, the actual solution is too long to include here. The reader interested in more details is therefore referred to the sources. 1 , 17 Only the results are summarized below:

from test: 117 Initially, the fraction of acid-base generation in the liquid phase away from the interface is negligible but increases with the total acid-base generation. However, this fraction remains limited
from Soup: 117 Corollary 1 under Theorem 10, and Theorem 11, together with the procedures and some of the relations of the section The Solvent Water as a Weak Electrolyte , were used to transform the initial coupled equations into a set where only two differential equations remained coupled and to determine the requisite four boundary conditions.

 ###### 
from test: 119 The distribution of the acid-base generation in the liquid phase initially is almost wholly adjacent to the interface but increasingly extends into the liquid layer as the fraction of acid-base generation in the liquid increases with the total acid-base generation. However, even at the highest fraction limit of about 0.35, the penetration remains very small. Over 99% of all acid-base generation occurs within a thin region adjacent to the membrane (including the interface), occupying less than one hundredth of the thickness of the idealized Nernst “stagnant diffusion layer,” provided the bulk electrolyte concentration is not too small (⩾0.0001N) . In Spiegler’s experiments, the idealized Nernst diffusion layer thickness was 0.021–0.05cm , and over 99% of all the acid-base generation occurred within less than 0.00021–0.0005cm , respectively, from the solution/membrane interface. Spiegler’s experiments are different from those considered by Vetter,19 as there are no electrochemical reactions (electrons transfer) in the electrodialysis process, and the acid-base generation occurs simultaneously as a heterogeneous process at the membrane/liquid interface and as a homogeneous process in the liquid. However, there are similarities with some of the steps in the mechanism of steel corrosion by carbon dioxide dissolved in water and forming carbonic acid, which dissociates and supplies hydrogen cation for cathodic reduction. For comparison, we cite research on such a process for which a reaction layer thickness of 0.001cm was determined20 using Vetter’s formula.19
from Soup: 119 Acid-base generation starts as a heterogeneous process at the solution/membrane interface on the depleted side where the water dissociation is driven by the depletion of the water ions at that interface. Such depletion can proceed appreciably only when, at that interface, the concentration of all ions is not too large compared to (KW)1∕2 , where KW is the water-ions product constant. Such a picture had been postulated before; 18 however, it is only part of a more complex picture, which had not been described in the literature.
 ###### 
from test: 120 A simpler model may closely approximate electrodialysis processes with acid-base generation, where the generation is considered to be a boundary condition. Note that the simpler model is exactly valid through over 99% of the Nernst diffusion layer. However, to treat this simpler model, the boundary condition at the membrane/solution interface still must be derived from the more exact model because the simpler model is not valid at that interface. Corollary 1, Theorem 7, (linear concentrations along X ) facilitates the solution of the simpler model with the correct boundary conditions.

from test: 121 Thus, one important conclusion of this work is that without the mathematical analysis, boundary conditions may be determined incorrectly, in some cases. Furthermore, it may not be possible to know that a boundary condition is incorrect until the analysis is performed. Numerical solution of the set of PDEs with the incorrect boundary conditions produces incorrect results. This explains the repeated failures of earlier attempts to solve the acid-base generation problem. By using a boundary condition that ignored the fraction of acid-base generation in the liquid phase, scientists unwittingly were forcing the whole process rate down to zero. Consistently, they found theoretically that acid-base generation was impossible, in contradiction with the experimental results.21

In such closed systems, the corrosion rate in a new capsule can decrease by two orders of magnitude in the first hour after heating the system to the test temperature, as shown in Fig. 8. The high decrease in corrosion rate is produced by the molecular hydrogen accumulation as a result of orders of magnitude decrease in hydrogen effusivity with the growth of the corrosion layer.33–35

from test: 163 The corrosion process produces various species in proportions that vary according to corrosion conditions. Important parameters affecting those proportions are the pH of the bulk water; impurities such as sodium chloride in the bulk water; incipient magnetite porosity, which is affected by impurities also; the thickness and morphology of the magnetite layer, which depends on its history; the ion-exchange properties of the corrosion layers; and the anodic corrosion products at the ferrous alloy surface, which may be classified such that one fraction of the corrosion products forms magnetite in situ at the metal surface by direct electrochemical conversion of solid metal to solid magnetite, which thus remains well anchored in the metal. This fraction provides the matrix for magnetite layer growth. The remainder of the anodic corrosion products in the form of dissolved iron species moves away from the metal anode through the liquid filling the magnetite pores. When this magnetite growth is the dominant corrosion product, then fast-growing nonprotective magnetite results.

from test: 177 The mathematical solution of electrochemical mass-transport problems usually involves a physico/mathematical analysis of the defined system, culminating in a set of simplifying assumptions, partial differential equations (PDEs), boundary conditions (BCs), and initial conditions (ICs). Then the equations are manipulated to obtain a set less difficult to solve. Having to go through the conversion of the PDEs for every problem of electrochemical mass transport is laborious and sometimes fastidious. Additionally, errors often find their way in the process and require additional time and effort in revising and correcting. Electrochemists could save much time and effort solving problems by application of the theorems, like mechanical engineers do in solving their problems by using the theorems of geometry instead of deriving from scratch the particular results for each and every specific mechanical problem.

from test: 178 Over many years following the extension of the Nernst-Planck mass-transport treatment to electrolytic multicomponent systems,1 the author developed further the mathematical treatment of mass transport in dilute electrolytic solutions, and the material developed reached a critical mass allowing its organization and formalization in the form of theorems. This work proposes 12 theorems and 9 corollaries of electrochemical mass transport in dilute stagnant solutions, with their proof. The theorems are based on the Nernst-Planck flux equation. We hope that this work is only a beginning and will inspire others to develop more theorems.

from test: 179 Newman reviews a general form of the Nernst-Planck flux equation, its applicability, and its limitations.2 Newman concludes: “Nevertheless, (the Nernst-Planck flux) equation … is recommended for general use because it is prevalent, both explicitly and implicitly, in the electrochemical literature and because it gives a good account of the physical processes involved without excessive complication. One should remember that it is strictly valid only in dilute solutions.”2 Additionally, “Transport theory valid for dilute solutions has been applied fruitfully to electrochemical systems.”2 The wide success of the Nernst-Planck flux equation is not explained. This wide success is found in cases of only one single independent driving force, i.e., only one single driving force externally applied. In cases with more than one independent driving force, the Nernst-Planck equation is expected to be inapplicable. For example, when an electrical potential difference is imposed over an aqueous electrolytic solution, both an electrical field distribution and a concentration gradient distribution develop and are functions of the electrical potential difference imposed on the solution. Only that potential difference is independent and the Nernst-Planck equation applies. Similarly for the case of diffusion, where a concentration difference (instead of an electrical potential difference) is applied over the electrolytic solution, the Nernst–Planck equation works well. However, if both an electrical potential difference and a concentration difference are imposed independently over the solution, then the Nernst-Planck does not apply. Instead, one must use the equations of coupled flows from the theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.3–5

from test: 180 The theorems should prove useful to workers and students of electrochemical transport problems, especially for problems involving electrolytic multicomponent systems. The validity and usefulness of the theorems have been demonstrated in their application to two important industrial cases, namely, electrodialysis of aqueous salt solutions at electrical current above so-called limiting current densities, and corrosion of steels in waters at high temperature and pressure. The results of these applications are summarized after the theorems. The author hopes that these theorems may be useful to the readers as well, and may inspire others to develop more theorems and their proof and that, eventually, they may all be incorporated into the electrochemistry curriculum.
