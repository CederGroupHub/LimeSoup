from test: 0 Cathodic processes in the CsCl-K3TaOF6 melt were studied in the temperature range 650–850°C by cyclic voltammetry. It was shown that electrolysis of the CsCl-K3TaOF6 melt led to the formation of several phases containing tantalum on the molybdenum cathode. The variations of the cathodic products at different concentrations of K3TaOF6 and temperatures were determined. It was found that TaO crystallizes at the cathode as nanoneedles to 1200 nm in length with a cross-section around of 100 nm together with other tantalum compounds. Monoxide of tantalum was obtained by electrolysis of molten salts only at temperatures below 810°C. Monoxide of tantalum is a high-pressure phase, so it was confirmed once more by electrolytic synthesis of TaO that an effect similar to the action of high pressure occurs during electrolysis.

from test: 1 It is well known that the nature of the anion in a solvent has a profound effect on the electrochemical behavior of refractory metals in melts.1 At the same time, the role of the cation composition of a solvent in electrochemical processes of oxohalide complexes has remained out of the focus. This may explain the limited and often nonfunctional choice of solvent employed in electrochemical researches, most of the time the equimolar NaCl-KCl mixture or the ternary LiF-NaF-KF eutectic (FLINAK). However, in many cases such a simplified approach to the choice of a solvent selection restricts the amount of information that could be obtained from electrochemical studies. From electrochemical point of view of the above-listed salt systems are essentially mixtures of several halides in random combination. Their using removes the possibility to determine the specific role played by each outer-sphere cation of the solvent in an electrochemical process. Meanwhile, our study of oxofluoride niobium salt systems2,3 showed that this role might be very important and even decisive. It was demonstrated that varying the outer-sphere cation composition is a powerful tool to control the chemical and phase composition of electrolysis products.4,5 Thus, only the substitution of sodium for a larger cation (K+, for example) in the fluoride solvent for K3NbOF6, other condition being invariable, entailed the oxygen content in the cathodic deposit to be decreased from 14–16 wt% to hundredths of one percent, while their phase composition changed from NbO to pure Nb metal.5 There is a possibility to synthesize novel low valence niobium compounds with layered structures when KF and RbF melts are used as solvent, but similar phases could not be obtained with LiF, NaF or CsF as solvents.4,5

The potential scan rate was varied between 0.05 and 2.0 V/s. The container for the melt was a glassy carbon (GC) ampoule (type SU-2000), which played the role of auxiliary electrode simultaneously. Voltammetric measurements were performed using a silver electrode (purity of more than 99.999%) 1 mm in diameter versus a quasi-reference electrode from glassy carbon (SU-2000 rod, 2 mm in diameter). Silver was chosen as the material for the working electrode since tantalum is insoluble in silver.10 It is difficult to find the suitable reference electrode for chloride-oxofluoride melts because of the corrosion action on glass or ceramics used as containers or diaphragms in construction of the traditional reference electrode. In this study that to avoid these difficulties, a glassy carbon rod was used as a quasi-reference electrode. The GC electrode monitors the redox potential of the melt, which remains constant, when composition of the melt is not changed. This potential was not defined thermodynamically, but due to GC quasi-reference electrode during experiments there was no contact between the melt and oxide materials. To obtain more reliable potential values a Ag/NaCl-KCl-AgCl (2 wt%) reference electrode was used. At the final stage of each set of experiments, this reference electrode was immersed in the melt for a short time for determination of the potential peaks, the melt being no longer used after this immersion.12

from Soup: 34 The tantalum dioxofluoride complexes that are formed by Reaction 8 are discharged at more negative potentials than monooxofluoride ones. To confirm our supposition regarding the nature of the R 2 wave, K 3 TaO 2 F 4 synthesized beforehand was added to the melt. Some increase in the R 2 wave height was observed after addition, which indicated that the dioxofluoride complexes were discharged at the potential of this wave.

from Soup: 35 The R 3 peak should be attributed to electroreduction of alkali metal cations on the surface of the products formed at the potentials R 1 and R 2 . Depolarization of the discharge of alkali metal cations is caused by a reduction reaction of these products.

from Soup: 36 The diagrams in Fig. 2 show that the electroreduction of TaOF 6 3− complexes with formation of TaO can occur by Reaction 6 at temperatures 650 and 750°C. Nevertheless, at 850°C monoxide of tantalum was not observed in cathodic deposits. The latter suggests that either cathodic Reaction 6 does not occur at this temperature or TaO decomposes into metallic tantalum and oxygen, since TaO is rather unstable compound and the Gibbs energy of its decomposition is very negative. 8

from Soup: 37 This suggestion is in agreement with the voltammetric curves obtained at 700 and 850°C ( Fig. 1 ). Indeed, at temperature 700°C, three electrooxidation peaks O ’ 1 , O ’’ 1 , and O ’’’ 1 ( Fig. 1a ) of the products, which are formed during cathodic cycle by Reactions 5 – 7 , correspond to the wide electroreduction peak R 1 . At the same time, at 850°C, two electrooxidation peaks O ’ 1 and O ’’ 1 corresponding to the ware R 1 are observed ( Fig. 1b ), which are assigned to dissolution of tantalum and the compound CsTa 2.5 O 5 F. These two waves of electrooxidation were also registered on the voltammograms at temperature 810°C.
