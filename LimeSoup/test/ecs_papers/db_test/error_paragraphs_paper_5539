from test: 0 We have investigated the impact of rapid thermal annealing (RTA) induced vacancy supersaturation on oxide precipitation based as much as possible on experimental and theoretical values. Oxygen precipitation after RTA processing was found to be controlled by the initial concentration of interstitial oxygen in a sixth power dependency and frozen vacancies just in a cubic dependency. The formation of tensile strained nVO2 clusters seems to be the favored process for coherent nucleation of oxide precipitates. The reduction of interstitial oxygen can be accurately modeled for the temperature range from 1150 to 1250°C using Ham’s theory for precipitate growth and an empirical relation based on nucleation of oxide precipitates by agglomeration of VO2 complexes. During RTA treatments at temperatures ≥1300°C vacancies seem to be consumed by other processes. Below RTA temperatures of 1150°C , oxide precipitation is dominated by shrunken as-grown precipitate nuclei because as-grown nuclei can be dissolved only at RTA temperatures ≥1150°C .

from test: 1 To obtain a correlation which is as much general as possible, wafers of various initial concentrations of interstitial oxygen C0 ranging from 4.5×1017cm−3 to 8×1017cm−3 , wafer diameters of 150, 200, and 300mm , obtained from crystals grown in various vacancy-rich growth modes and growth modes resulting in extremely tiny agglomerates of intrinsic point defects, were used in the experiments. All wafers were moderately B-doped with resistivities between 2 and 20Ωcm . The initial concentration of substitutional carbon was always below 1016cm−3 .
from Soup: 1 The silicon oxide precipitation in Czochralski (CZ) silicon is strongly related to intrinsic point defects. 1 , 2 Supersaturation of vacancies is known to enhance oxide precipitation while it is retarded by interstitial supersaturation. This is due to the fact that the compressive strain which results from the volume difference between silicon and the precipitating silicon oxide can be reduced either by the absorption of vacancies or the emission of interstitials.
 ###### 
from test: 2 These wafers were first heat-treated in an RTA at various temperatures (1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1175, 1200, 1225, 1230, 1250, 1300, 1325, or 1350°C ) for 10 or 30s in argon or mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen. The cooling rates used were 5, 15, 30, 50, 60, 70, 75, 90, or 100K∕s . After the RTA treatment all wafers received the same two step anneal consisting of 780°C for 3h followed by 1000°C for 16h in oxygen. During the RTA step vacancy profiles are created with a high concentration of vacancies in the bulk and a vacancy denuded zone near the surface. The concentration in the bulk depends first of all on temperature and duration of the RTA treatment whereas the vacancy denuded zone can be influenced by the cooling rate. The thermal treatment at 780°C comprises a so-called nucleation step which serves to stabilize the precipitate nuclei. Then these nuclei are grown to a detectable size by annealing at 1000°C for 16 h.
from Soup: 2 Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) is a method that is used to generate vacancy profiles in silicon wafers which serve for creation of defect denuded zones near the surface and high densities of bulk microdefects (BMDs). 3 It is believed that the nucleation rate is controlled by the concentration of vacancies and is thus independent of the oxygen content. 3 The vacancy supersaturation due to RTA is assumed to be stored in the form of VO2 vacancy oxygen complexes. 4 The agglomeration of the VO2 species is regarded as also a possible path for nucleation which would need shorter incubation periods than usual oxygen agglomeration at lower vacancy concentration. 3 , 4
 ###### 
from test: 3 The oxygen concentration was measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) using a conversion factor of 2.45×1017cm−2 (new ASTM, DIN 50438/1). The average density of BMDs was determined after etching the (110) cleavage plane perpendicular to the surface using Wright etchant6 or Secco etchant.7 At least three measurement points per wafer depending on the diameter were analyzed before and after all heat-treatments. In total, 187 data sets containing initial oxygen concentration C0 , oxygen concentration after the heat-treatments C(t) , and BMD density NBMD were included into the correlation analysis.
from Soup: 3 In Ref. 5 , more experimental results about the impact of RTA on oxygen precipitation were presented than in Ref. 3 . A correlation between the excess vacancy concentration and the density of BMDs has shown that the BMD densities scatter over a wide range for the same vacancy concentration.
 ###### 
from test: 4 In addition to the measured data sets, simulated values were generated which are based on commonly accepted theories. In this way, important intrinsic point defects and their complexes with oxygen became part of the correlation analysis also. To obtain the average concentrations of vacancies CV , VO complexes CVO , and VO2 complexes CVO2 in the wafers, the vacancy and interstitial profiles were numerically simulated for each RTA process used. The numerical simulation was based on point defect diffusion and the Frenkel-pair mechanism for generation and recombination of vacancies and interstitials. The following basic equations were used where, DI and DV are the diffusion coefficients of interstitials and vacancies, respectively, as obtained from Ref. 8, CI is the interstitial concentration, t is the time, and x stands for the depth from the wafer surface. The equilibrium concentrations of interstitials CIeq and vacancies CVeq were obtained from Ref. 8. The second term of Eq. 1, 2 describes the Frenkel-pair mechanism with kIV being the reaction constant which is obtained by Eq. 3 according to Ref. 9 where, T and k are the temperature and Boltzmann’s constant, respectively. The atomic density of silicon Cat , amounts to 5×1022cm−3 , the capture radius rC is 1×10−7cm , and the volume of the silicon unit cell Ω equals one-eighth of the cube of the lattice constant of silicon. The free energy barrier for recombination is a controversial parameter which varies between 0 and 1.5eV .9 In our calculations of the intrinsic point defect profiles, the energy barrier was set to zero.
from Soup: 4 The aim of this work was to investigate the impact of RTA induced vacancy supersaturation on oxide precipitation based on a broad set of experimental values obtained from variations of RTA temperature, cooling rate, vacancy concentration, interstitial oxygen concentration, and crystal pulling conditions to gain a comprehensive overview on the various parameter dependencies of the oxygen precipitation. Based on these correlations, an analytical model was developed which can describe the reduction of interstitial oxygen during a process consisting of an RTA treatment and a so-called BMD test comprising a two-step anneal at 780°C for 3h and at 1000°C for 16h . In addition, an atomistic model was developed that describes a coherent nucleation process for oxide precipitates in agreement with the results of the analytical model.
 ###### 
from test: 5 The simulation of the point defect profiles of the RTA treatments was frozen at 1000°C where VO2 becomes the dominating vacancy containing species and diffusion of intrinsic point defects decreases markedly.4 Based on the average concentration of vacancies in the wafer the concentrations of the VO and VO2 complexes were determined using the relations given in Eq. 4, 5 obtained from Ref. 4, 10
from Soup: 5 To obtain a correlation which is as much general as possible, wafers of various initial concentrations of interstitial oxygen C0 ranging from 4.5×1017cm−3 to 8×1017cm−3 , wafer diameters of 150, 200, and 300mm , obtained from crystals grown in various vacancy-rich growth modes and growth modes resulting in extremely tiny agglomerates of intrinsic point defects, were used in the experiments. All wafers were moderately B-doped with resistivities between 2 and 20Ωcm . The initial concentration of substitutional carbon was always below 1016cm−3 .
 ###### 
from test: 6 For our correlation analysis, only average values of vacancies and complexes were needed because the oxygen concentrations measured by FTIR were also obtained in transmission from the whole thickness of the wafers. However, the calculation of the profiles was required because the cooling rate after RTA strongly impacts the average concentration via the out-diffusion of interstitials and vacancies during cooling. The average vacancy concentrations were calculated from the vacancy profiles over the whole wafer thickness. In summary, this simulation adds the parameters CV , CVO , and CVO2 to the data sets.
from Soup: 6 These wafers were first heat-treated in an RTA at various temperatures (1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1175, 1200, 1225, 1230, 1250, 1300, 1325, or 1350°C ) for 10 or 30s in argon or mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen. The cooling rates used were 5, 15, 30, 50, 60, 70, 75, 90, or 100K∕s . After the RTA treatment all wafers received the same two step anneal consisting of 780°C for 3h followed by 1000°C for 16h in oxygen. During the RTA step vacancy profiles are created with a high concentration of vacancies in the bulk and a vacancy denuded zone near the surface. The concentration in the bulk depends first of all on temperature and duration of the RTA treatment whereas the vacancy denuded zone can be influenced by the cooling rate. The thermal treatment at 780°C comprises a so-called nucleation step which serves to stabilize the precipitate nuclei. Then these nuclei are grown to a detectable size by annealing at 1000°C for 16 h.
 ###### 
from test: 7 Ham’s theory,11 for diffusion limited growth of particles is commonly accepted for describing the growth of oxide precipitates. It is based on the initial assumptions that the concentration of interstitial oxygen C0 is uniform, the concentration of precipitates N remains constant during the whole period of heat-treatment, and that the precipitates are of spherical shape with the radius r which is small compared to the distance between adjacent particles. The particles are distributed uniformly. Each of the particles is surrounded by a spherical region of equal volume, the equivalent sphere of a cubic cell, of radius re . The concentration of oxygen at the interface between matrix and precipitate is equal to the solubility of oxygen in silicon CS at the annealing temperature. The particles consist of silicon oxide in which the oxygen concentration is CP . Equations 6, 7 are the basic equations in Ham’s theory which hold until about 50% of the supersaturated oxygen is precipitated. where DOX is the diffusivity of oxygen. CP being 2.90×1022cm−3 according to Ref. 12 is several orders of magnitude larger than CS . C(t) is the concentration of interstitial oxygen which is measured after the thermal treatment. Then, Eq. 6, 7 can be summarized as

 ###### 
from test: 8 Both the temperature dependent diffusivity DOX and solubility CS of interstitial oxygen were obtained from Ref. 13. Thus, re remains the only unknown variable. This offers the possibility to calculate the density of growing oxide precipitates Ncalc from the measured difference of interstitial oxygen before and after the heat-treatments according to Eq. 10 which was obtained from Eq. 8, 9. The advantage of such a theoretically obtained value would be that it is independent of detection limits, which can affect measurement values of BMD density14

 ###### 
from test: 9 In Fig. 1, the calculated oxide precipitate density Ncalc is compared to the average BMD density NBMD measured by cleave and etch. It can be assumed that nearly all BMDs are oxide precipitates. Part of the measured values correlate well with the calculated values but some measured densities are much lower than the calculated densities. The latter case was only observed on a few wafers with lower C0 . It is assumed that due to the lower growth rate in silicon with low oxygen concentration some of the precipitates remained below the detection limit. In summary, applying Ham’s theory an additional value Ncalc is added to the data sets for the correlation analysis.

 ###### 
from test: 10 At first, the precipitated oxygen was correlated to the frozen-in vacancy concentration after RTA which was obtained from the simulated profiles in order to check if the correlation between oxygen precipitation and vacancy concentration holds also for the large variety of experimental parameters. The results in Fig. 2 demonstrate that the percentage of supersaturated interstitial oxygen that is precipitated varies over a wide range. Generally, higher vacancy concentrations can result in higher oxide precipitation but in many cases they do not. For high vacancy concentrations, the variation ranges from 15–70% oxygen precipitated which implies that the vacancy concentration alone does not control the oxygen precipitation.

 ###### 
from test: 11 It was further checked if the oxygen concentration impacts the oxygen precipitation. This is shown in Fig. 3. The result looks quite similar to the correlation with the frozen vacancy concentration. Low oxygen concentration results in low precipitation and high oxygen concentration exhibits a variation from 1–70% oxygen precipitated. Thus, precipitation is not controlled by oxygen alone.

from test: 12 A detailed investigation of the variations at high vacancy concentration and high oxygen concentration has elucidated that a high vacancy concentration can only enhance oxide precipitation if the oxygen concentration is also high.

 ###### 
from test: 13 A correlation of oxygen precipitation with the concentration of VO complexes was not found and values were scattered in the same manner as observed for correlations of oxygen and vacancy concentrations with precipitated oxygen.
from Soup: 13 In Fig. 1 , the calculated oxide precipitate density Ncalc is compared to the average BMD density NBMD measured by cleave and etch. It can be assumed that nearly all BMDs are oxide precipitates. Part of the measured values correlate well with the calculated values but some measured densities are much lower than the calculated densities.

In summary, applying Ham’s theory an additional value Ncalc is added to the data sets for the correlation analysis.
 ###### 
from test: 14 The best correlation of the precipitated supersaturated oxygen was obtained with the concentration of VO2 complexes as shown in Fig. 4. However, this holds only for RTA temperatures from 1150–1250°C . Here the precipitated oxygen is proportional to the third power of the concentration of VO2 complexes. The exact correlation obtained iswith m=2.99 , kR=1.21×10−39cm3m , and a squared correlation coefficient according to Pearson of R2=0.943 . With respect to Eq. 4, it can be said that the precipitated oxygen is proportional to the sixth power of oxygen concentration and the cube of the frozen vacancy concentration. Thus, speaking in terms of interstitial oxygen and vacancies, both species control the oxygen precipitation by VO2 formation and the impact of interstitial oxygen is much stronger than the impact of vacancies. VO2 formation is a possibility of vacancy conservation.3 Free vacancies would be at equilibrium concentration in the whole wafer already after annealing for about 30min at 780°C . The total concentration of VO2 complexes, which strongly impact oxide precipitation, is five orders of magnitude lower than the total concentration of interstitial oxygen. Thus, the question arises what the enhancing mechanism of VO2 could be. A self-evident mechanism would be that the VO2 complexes serve as nucleation centers for precipitation. Agglomeration of VO2 would provide a form of coherent nucleation. Consequently, Si2V2O4 would be the smallest coherent oxide precipitate nucleus which is formed by two VO2 complexes but four VO2 complexes are needed to form the smallest SiO2 where one Si atom is bound to oxygen atoms only. As long as the agglomeration proceeds by VO2 attachment only, the nuclei could remain coherent. The simultaneous attachment of a VO complex and an interstitial oxygen would be of the same effect.
from Soup: 14 At first, the precipitated oxygen was correlated to the frozen-in vacancy concentration after RTA which was obtained from the simulated profiles in order to check if the correlation between oxygen precipitation and vacancy concentration holds also for the large variety of experimental parameters.

Generally, higher vacancy concentrations can result in higher oxide precipitation but in many cases they do not. For high vacancy concentrations, the variation ranges from 15–70% oxygen precipitated which implies that the vacancy concentration alone does not control the oxygen precipitation.
 ###### 
from test: 15 To obtain the correlation between the density of oxide precipitate nuclei and CVO2 , the precipitate nuclei density calculated using Ham’s theory Ncalc was plotted as a function of CVO2 as seen in Fig. 5. The following correlation was obtainedwith the constant factor a=3.81×10−29cm6 and a squared correlation coefficient according to Pearson of R2=0.963 .
from Soup: 15 It was further checked if the oxygen concentration impacts the oxygen precipitation. This is shown in Fig. 3 . The result looks quite similar to the correlation with the frozen vacancy concentration. Low oxygen concentration results in low precipitation and high oxygen concentration exhibits a variation from 1–70% oxygen precipitated. Thus, precipitation is not controlled by oxygen alone.
 ###### 
from test: 16 As shown in Fig. 5, the results of our correlation analysis are in a very good agreement with the relation between precipitate density (after RTA+800°C 4h+1000°C 16h ) and vacancy concentration measured by platinum diffusion after RTA as published in Ref. 3, 10. We assume here as proposed in Ref. 3 that the vacancy concentration measured by Pt diffusion is actually the concentration of VO2 complexes because the vacancies are stored in VO2 complexes below 1000°C . The Pt diffusion was retarded in CZ silicon compared to FZ silicon.3 The good agreement between the results compared in Fig. 5 demonstrates again that the nucleation of oxide precipitate nuclei is not independent of the oxygen concentration because oxygen is a crucial component in the storage mechanism of vacancies and in the formation of VO2 nucleation sites. The power of 3 indicates that the formation of 3VO2 clusters is critical for the nucleation of oxide precipitates under the thermal treatments applied subsequent to the RTA treatments.
from Soup: 16 A detailed investigation of the variations at high vacancy concentration and high oxygen concentration has elucidated that a high vacancy concentration can only enhance oxide precipitation if the oxygen concentration is also high.
 ###### 
from test: 17 With Eq. 12 and the equations of Ham’s theory Eq. 6, 7, 8, an analytical model is obtained which allows determining the reduction of interstitial oxygen after a process consisting of RTA and BMD test. The input parameters for modeling the reduction of oxygen are the RTA conditions and C0 . The RTA conditions are needed to numerically calculate the average concentration of VO2 complexes which is needed to calculate the precipitate nuclei density for use in Ham’s equations. This model is valid for RTA temperatures between 1150 and 1250°C . Figure 6 provides an accuracy check comparing the modeled ΔC0 with the measured ΔC0 . The squared correlation coefficient according to Pearson amounts to 0.972 confirming a high accuracy of the model. Equation 11 can also be used for modeling purposes.
from Soup: 17 A correlation of oxygen precipitation with the concentration of VO complexes was not found and values were scattered in the same manner as observed for correlations of oxygen and vacancy concentrations with precipitated oxygen.
 ###### 
from test: 18 Coming back to Fig. 4, all the correlations discussed above hold for RTA temperatures between 1150 and 1250°C only. For higher RTA temperatures (≥1300°C) , the precipitated oxygen decreases with increasing concentration of VO2 complexes. In the framework of this model, this can be explained only by missing vacancies for VO2 formation. A part of the vacancies seems to be consumed more and more by other processes as the RTA temperature exceeds 1300°C . Clarification of this would need further investigations.

 ###### 
from test: 19 For RTA temperatures lower than 1150°C , the oxygen precipitation becomes independent of the concentration of frozen VO2 complexes as shown in Fig. 4. It is assumed that a temperature of at least 1150°C is needed to dissolve the grown-in oxide precipitate nuclei because they still seem to dominate oxygen precipitation after RTA below 1150°C . The nucleation due to the quite low concentration of frozen VO2 at RTA temperatures ≤1150°C is just weak and is by far not exceeding the density of grown-in nuclei. RTAs at low temperatures obviously just shrink the as-grown nuclei what would lead to more homogeneous precipitate densities for a given oxygen concentration because size differences of the grown-in nuclei are reduced. This homogenization becomes obvious in Fig. 7 which compares the oxide precipitate density of low temperature RTA treated wafers with wafers which have not received an RTA prior to the BMD test. While the precipitate density of the wafers without an RTA is scattering and dependent on the interstitial oxygen, the precipitate density of the wafers with an RTA treatment at 1000 or 1050°C remains at a constant level of about 109cm−3 for a wide range of initial concentration of interstitial oxygen.
from Soup: 19 To obtain the correlation between the density of oxide precipitate nuclei and CVO2 , the precipitate nuclei density calculated using Ham’s theory Ncalc was plotted as a function of CVO2 as seen in Fig. 5 . The following correlation was obtained with the constant factor a=3.81×10−29cm6 and a squared correlation coefficient according to Pearson of R2=0.963 .
 ###### 
from test: 20 Already during crystal pulling, the same processes lead to VO2 formation and nucleation of course. In the bulk crystal, out-diffusion of intrinsic point defects plays a minor role and is important only in the edge region of the crystal. Therefore, at the much lower cooling rate during crystal pulling supersaturated vacancies can be frozen as VO2 complexes and nuclei can be formed already during cooling of the crystal. The nuclei density would be influenced first of all by the pulling conditions and the resulting supersaturation of intrinsic point defects. Because the grown-in nuclei are dissolved at RTA temperatures ≥1150°C , it would be possible to reinstall a precipitate nuclei density at a lower or higher level than the grown-in nuclei density. This can be managed by adjusting the RTA conditions for VO2 formation.
from Soup: 20 As shown in Fig. 5 , the results of our correlation analysis are in a very good agreement with the relation between precipitate density (after RTA+800°C 4h+1000°C 16h ) and vacancy concentration measured by platinum diffusion after RTA as published in Ref. 3 , 10 . We assume here as proposed in Ref. 3 that the vacancy concentration measured by Pt diffusion is actually the concentration of VO2 complexes because the vacancies are stored in VO2 complexes below 1000°C . The Pt diffusion was retarded in CZ silicon compared to FZ silicon. 3 The good agreement between the results compared in Fig. 5 demonstrates again that the nucleation of oxide precipitate nuclei is not independent of the oxygen concentration because oxygen is a crucial component in the storage mechanism of vacancies and in the formation of VO2 nucleation sites. The power of 3 indicates that the formation of 3VO2 clusters is critical for the nucleation of oxide precipitates under the thermal treatments applied subsequent to the RTA treatments.
 ###### 
from test: 21 To gain further insight into the details of the process of nucleation and growth of SiO2 precipitates under vacancy supersaturation conditions, we performed ab initio calculations for total energies and atomic structures of point defects (Oi , VO2 , cf. Fig. 8a), point defect clusters (nVO2 for n=2 , 3, 4, cf. Fig. 8b), and bulk models of SiO2 precipitates (amorphous SiO2 and “seed”-SiO2 in a structure coherent with VO2 clusters, as explained below). The calculations were done with the ab initio pseudopotential plane wave code fhi96md,15 i.e., under periodic boundary conditions. We applied the local density approximation (LDA) for the exchange and correlation energy16, 17 and nonlocal pseudopotentials in the Trouller-Martins scheme18, 19 with 40 Ry cutoff for plane waves. The point defects and point defect clusters were contained in tetragonal supercells of two sizes: 3×3×8 , consisting of eight Si(001) layers (72 Si atoms) and 4×4×8 , consisting of eight Si(001) layers (128 Si atoms). The Brillouin zone was sampled at the (1/4, 1/4, 1/4) point of the supercell. We verified that this sampling results in total energy differences converged to at least 30meV , which is accurate enough for our purposes. More concern is due to the size of the supercell. For example, the difference of the chemical potential of oxygen, μ(O) , between a 2VO2 cluster in a 3×3×8 cell and in a 4×4×8eV amounts to 90meV . Nevertheless, the main physical features of the system can be extracted from these results.
from Soup: 21 With Eq. 12 and the equations of Ham’s theory Eq. 6, 7, 8 , an analytical model is obtained which allows determining the reduction of interstitial oxygen after a process consisting of RTA and BMD test. The input parameters for modeling the reduction of oxygen are the RTA conditions and C0 . The RTA conditions are needed to numerically calculate the average concentration of VO2 complexes which is needed to calculate the precipitate nuclei density for use in Ham’s equations. This model is valid for RTA temperatures between 1150 and 1250°C . Figure 6 provides an accuracy check comparing the modeled ΔC0 with the measured ΔC0 . The squared correlation coefficient according to Pearson amounts to 0.972 confirming a high accuracy of the model. Equation 11 can also be used for modeling purposes.
 ###### 
from test: 22 The “seed”-SiO2 (seed-SiO2 ) bulk model is obtained by a periodic repetition of the 4VO2 cluster consisting of four VO2 defects. In its ideal geometry, such a crystal is coherent with Si bulk (Fig. 9a and 9b): it can be obtained by removing each second (001) layer from the Si lattice and connecting with oxygen bridges the dangling bonds of the resulting Si vacancies. The size of the primitive cell of the ideal seed–SiO2 corresponds then to the 1×1×4 Si(001) cell. Such geometry is the natural extension of nVO2 clusters to the infinite size limit.
from Soup: 22 Coming back to Fig. 4 , all the correlations discussed above hold for RTA temperatures between 1150 and 1250°C only. For higher RTA temperatures (≥1300°C) , the precipitated oxygen decreases with increasing concentration of VO2 complexes. In the framework of this model, this can be explained only by missing vacancies for VO2 formation. A part of the vacancies seems to be consumed more and more by other processes as the RTA temperature exceeds 1300°C . Clarification of this would need further investigations.
 ###### 
from test: 23 The first observation, evident already from the examination of interatomic distances in the ideal structure of seed–SiO2 , is that there is a considerable misfit between the lattices of seed–SiO2 and of Si. As a matter of fact, when the symmetry constrains within the primitive cell of seed–SiO2 are lifted (but the cell itself remains coherent with Si), the Si and O atoms reorganize spontaneously, whereby all Si atoms convert to triply oxidized silanone configuration (Fig. 9c). Each Si atom is thus connected with two Si neighbors through regular O bridges, and its remaining two orbitals are saturated by a nonbridging O atom forming a silanone (Si=O) bond.
from Soup: 23 For RTA temperatures lower than 1150°C , the oxygen precipitation becomes independent of the concentration of frozen VO2 complexes as shown in Fig. 4 . It is assumed that a temperature of at least 1150°C is needed to dissolve the grown-in oxide precipitate nuclei because they still seem to dominate oxygen precipitation after RTA below 1150°C . The nucleation due to the quite low concentration of frozen VO2 at RTA temperatures ≤1150°C is just weak and is by far not exceeding the density of grown-in nuclei. RTAs at low temperatures obviously just shrink the as-grown nuclei what would lead to more homogeneous precipitate densities for a given oxygen concentration because size differences of the grown-in nuclei are reduced. This homogenization becomes obvious in Fig. 7 which compares the oxide precipitate density of low temperature RTA treated wafers with wafers which have not received an RTA prior to the BMD test. While the precipitate density of the wafers without an RTA is scattering and dependent on the interstitial oxygen, the precipitate density of the wafers with an RTA treatment at 1000 or 1050°C remains at a constant level of about 109cm−3 for a wide range of initial concentration of interstitial oxygen.
 ###### 
from test: 24 We relaxed the volume of the seed–SiO2 crystal, keeping for simplicity the c/a ratio of the tetragonal cell fixed. As seen in Fig. 10, the volume of seed–SiO2 shrinks and reaches equilibrium at Δc=−0.5Å . This would correspond to linear compression Δa∕a of the Si lattice by about 10%. At the equilibrium lattice constant, the seed–SiO2 crystal conserves the ideal topology of the VO2 cluster (Fig. 9d). The transition from silanone to silica is reflected in the energy diagram in Fig. 10 by the appearance of a kink in the right-hand side of the energy curve around Δc=−0.2Å .
from Soup: 24 Already during crystal pulling, the same processes lead to VO2 formation and nucleation of course. In the bulk crystal, out-diffusion of intrinsic point defects plays a minor role and is important only in the edge region of the crystal. Therefore, at the much lower cooling rate during crystal pulling supersaturated vacancies can be frozen as VO2 complexes and nuclei can be formed already during cooling of the crystal. The nuclei density would be influenced first of all by the pulling conditions and the resulting supersaturation of intrinsic point defects. Because the grown-in nuclei are dissolved at RTA temperatures ≥1150°C , it would be possible to reinstall a precipitate nuclei density at a lower or higher level than the grown-in nuclei density. This can be managed by adjusting the RTA conditions for VO2 formation.
 ###### 
from test: 25 There are three fundamental facts which are crucial to the nucleation process:
from Soup: 25 To gain further insight into the details of the process of nucleation and growth of SiO2 precipitates under vacancy supersaturation conditions, we performed ab initio calculations for total energies and atomic structures of point defects ( Oi , VO2 , cf. Fig. 8a ), point defect clusters ( nVO2 for n=2 , 3, 4, cf. Fig. 8b ), and bulk models of SiO2 precipitates (amorphous SiO2 and “seed”- SiO2 in a structure coherent with VO2 clusters, as explained below). The calculations were done with the ab initio pseudopotential plane wave code fhi96md, 15 i.e., under periodic boundary conditions. We applied the local density approximation (LDA) for the exchange and correlation energy 16 , 17 and nonlocal pseudopotentials in the Trouller-Martins scheme 18 , 19 with 40 Ry cutoff for plane waves. The point defects and point defect clusters were contained in tetragonal supercells of two sizes: 3×3×8 , consisting of eight Si(001) layers (72 Si atoms) and 4×4×8 , consisting of eight Si(001) layers (128 Si atoms). The Brillouin zone was sampled at the (1/4, 1/4, 1/4) point of the supercell. We verified that this sampling results in total energy differences converged to at least 30meV , which is accurate enough for our purposes. More concern is due to the size of the supercell. For example, the difference of the chemical potential of oxygen, μ(O) , between a 2VO2 cluster in a 3×3×8 cell and in a 4×4×8eV amounts to 90meV . Nevertheless, the main physical features of the system can be extracted from these results.
 ###### 
from test: 26 VO2 defects tend to form nVO2 clusters (cf. Fig. 10). This is because the Si atom in the center of each 4VO2 cluster can fully relax its bond angles with all its neighbors; this is not possible in an isolated VO2 .
from Soup: 26 The “seed”- SiO2 (seed- SiO2 ) bulk model is obtained by a periodic repetition of the 4VO2 cluster consisting of four VO2 defects. In its ideal geometry, such a crystal is coherent with Si bulk (Fig. 9a and 9b ): it can be obtained by removing each second (001) layer from the Si lattice and connecting with oxygen bridges the dangling bonds of the resulting Si vacancies. The size of the primitive cell of the ideal seed– SiO2 corresponds then to the 1×1×4 Si(001) cell. Such geometry is the natural extension of nVO2 clusters to the infinite size limit.
 ###### 
from test: 27 Due to a significant (10%) lattice mismatch, nVO2 clusters cannot grow indefinitely; the specific density of Si in a cluster coherent with the host lattice is too small to support the formation of a continuous silica bond network.
from Soup: 27 The first observation, evident already from the examination of interatomic distances in the ideal structure of seed– SiO2 , is that there is a considerable misfit between the lattices of seed– SiO2 and of Si. As a matter of fact, when the symmetry constrains within the primitive cell of seed– SiO2 are lifted (but the cell itself remains coherent with Si), the Si and O atoms reorganize spontaneously, whereby all Si atoms convert to triply oxidized silanone configuration (Fig. 9c ). Each Si atom is thus connected with two Si neighbors through regular O bridges, and its remaining two orbitals are saturated by a nonbridging O atom forming a silanone (Si=O) bond.
 ###### 
from test: 28 Although the chemical potential μ(O) of oxygen is noticeably (by approx. 0.2eV , cf. Fig. 10) lower in Oi than in VO2 and even lower than in 4VO2 , the conversion of VO2 into 2Oi is hindered by the kinetic barrier caused by the high energy (exceeding 4eV ) of the Si vacancy produced when VO2 dissociates.

from test: 29 Therefore, oxygen atoms trapped in VO2 defects may lower their energy only when nVO2 clusters are formed.
from Soup: 29 There are three fundamental facts which are crucial to the nucleation process:
 ###### 
from test: 30 These observations allow us to formulate a simple atomistic model of the process of nucleation and growth of SiO2 precipitates in vacancy supersaturated material. Precipitate nuclei are formed as the first step. They consist of tiny nVO2 clusters and have locally the geometry similar to that of seed–SiO2 . The nuclei formation volume ΔVo (with respect to perfect Si) is negative, that is, the Si host and the seed–SiO2 precipitate nuclei are under tensile strain. The growth of the nuclei by attachment of further VO2 is limited by the 10% lattice mismatch between seed–SiO2 and silicon. Therefore, at a certain point the precipitation can continue only through oxidation of the silicon around the nuclei. Interstitial oxygen atoms, Oi , are now attracted by the tensile strain field of the nucleus. They oxidize the Si–Si bonds in the immediate vicinity of the nVO2 cluster, so that a cristobalite-like mantle is grown. Indeed, the cristobalite structure may be visualized as the Si structure with all Si–Si bonds substituted by oxygen bridges. The compressive strain produced by the clustering of Oi into the cristobalite mantle is annihilated by the tensile strain due to the presence of the seed–SiO2 cluster core. In the course of this process, the formation volume ΔVo of the precipitate changes from negative towards zero. As further Oi are attached, ΔVo may become positive.

 ###### 
from test: 31 The precipitate grown in this way is thus built of a seed–SiO2 core with a cristobalite mantle. The process consumes VO2 and interstitial oxygen. When the crystallite is large enough and the annealing temperature high enough, the structure of the precipitate may change to amorphous.

 ###### 
from test: 32 We have investigated the impact of RTA-induced vacancy supersaturation on oxide precipitation based as much as possible on experimental and theoretical values obtained from variations of RTA temperature, vacancy concentration, and interstitial oxygen concentration to gain connections being as general as possible. In summary, the following conclusions can be drawn.

Fig. 10 ) lower in Oi than in VO2 and even lower than in 4VO2 , the conversion of VO2 into 2Oi is hindered by the kinetic barrier caused by the high energy (exceeding 4eV ) of the Si vacancy produced when VO2 dissociates. Therefore, oxygen atoms trapped in VO2 defects may lower their energy only when nVO2 clusters are formed.
 ###### 
from test: 33 Oxygen precipitation after RTA processing was found to be controlled by the initial concentration of interstitial oxygen in a sixth power dependency and frozen vacancies in just a cubic dependency.

 ###### 
from test: 34 The favored process for nucleation of oxide precipitates after RTA treatments is the agglomeration of VO2 complexes. This type of coherent nucleation seems energetically favored because it would not require the generation and emission of silicon self-interstitials for strain release. The density of oxide precipitate nuclei was found to be proportional to the cube of VO2 complexes formed during cooling after RTA.
from Soup: 34 The precipitate grown in this way is thus built of a seed– SiO2 core with a cristobalite mantle. The process consumes VO2 and interstitial oxygen. When the crystallite is large enough and the annealing temperature high enough, the structure of the precipitate may change to amorphous.

from test: 35 The reduction of interstitial oxygen during a process consisting of an RTA treatment and a so-called BMD test comprised of a two-step anneal at 780°C for 3h and at 1000°C for 16h can be accurately modeled for the temperature range from 1150 to 1250°C using Ham’s theory for precipitate growth and an empirical connection based on nucleation of oxide precipitates by agglomeration of VO2 complexes.

 ###### 
from test: 37 Below RTA temperatures of 1150°C , oxide precipitation seems to be dominated by shrunken as-grown precipitate nuclei. This homogenizes precipitate density and makes it independent of interstitial oxygen over a wide range but it does not enhance oxide precipitation. Obviously, as-grown nuclei are dissolved only at RTA temperatures ≥1150°C .

from test: 41 Unlimited coherent growth of nuclei by further attachment of VO2 is not possible because of the increasing strain energy due to the misfit and because the concentration of VO2 complexes is orders of magnitude smaller than the concentration of interstitial oxygen Oi .

from test: 42 The results presented in this contribution provide a step forward to further understand and model oxide precipitation in CZ silicon. Until now, modeling is related to the VO2 concentration frozen after RTA. The next steps would need to be targeted on understanding the kinetics of VO2 decay after out-diffusion of supersaturated vacancies which is assumed to influence nucleation kinetics. Modeling VO2 formation during crystal pulling would help to understand formation of as-grown nuclei which are important for many thermal processes.

from test: 46 The silicon oxide precipitation in Czochralski (CZ) silicon is strongly related to intrinsic point defects.1, 2 Supersaturation of vacancies is known to enhance oxide precipitation while it is retarded by interstitial supersaturation. This is due to the fact that the compressive strain which results from the volume difference between silicon and the precipitating silicon oxide can be reduced either by the absorption of vacancies or the emission of interstitials.

from test: 47 Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) is a method that is used to generate vacancy profiles in silicon wafers which serve for creation of defect denuded zones near the surface and high densities of bulk microdefects (BMDs).3 It is believed that the nucleation rate is controlled by the concentration of vacancies and is thus independent of the oxygen content.3 The vacancy supersaturation due to RTA is assumed to be stored in the form of VO2 vacancy oxygen complexes.4 The agglomeration of the VO2 species is regarded as also a possible path for nucleation which would need shorter incubation periods than usual oxygen agglomeration at lower vacancy concentration.3, 4

 ###### 
from test: 49 The aim of this work was to investigate the impact of RTA induced vacancy supersaturation on oxide precipitation based on a broad set of experimental values obtained from variations of RTA temperature, cooling rate, vacancy concentration, interstitial oxygen concentration, and crystal pulling conditions to gain a comprehensive overview on the various parameter dependencies of the oxygen precipitation. Based on these correlations, an analytical model was developed which can describe the reduction of interstitial oxygen during a process consisting of an RTA treatment and a so-called BMD test comprising a two-step anneal at 780°C for 3h and at 1000°C for 16h . In addition, an atomistic model was developed that describes a coherent nucleation process for oxide precipitates in agreement with the results of the analytical model.
