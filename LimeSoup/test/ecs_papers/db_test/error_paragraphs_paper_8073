Both lithium bis(pentafluoroethylsulfonyl)imide and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6 ) are soluble in EC+DEC+TPTP (5:45:50 in volume), while LiPF6 is not soluble in EC+DEC+TMMP (5:45:50). The enhanced discharge properties of Li-ion batteries (typically graphite/LiCoO2 ) in those electrolyte systems were evaluated and compared with the conventional carbonate mixed ones. The TPTP-mixed electrolyte [1M LiPF6∕EC+DEC+TPTP (5:45:50)] gave a high capacity retention of 80% at an extremely high rate of 12C. An EC+DEC -based electrolyte normally exhibited poor retention of less than 40%. Such a rate-enhancing effect of HFEs (TPTP and TMMP) was manifested by observation over a wide temperature range from −20to+25°C . The striking enhancement was observed at −20°C and at the first 10% dosage and level off at 50%. The activation energy, as substantiated by microvoltammetry, for the Li+ desolvation process decreases from 45–100kJmol−1 (over the Li+ concentration range of 0.01–2M , respectively) to 25kJmol−1 by adding TMMP or TPTP. This implies that in the presence of HFEs, the kinetics for the rate-determining intercalation process is enhanced by an accelerated Li+ transport with a reduced solvation number.

from test: 3 The dependency of the lithium deposition–dissolution behavior on temperature was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV). A nickel microelectrode (25μm ϕ, 490μm2 surface area) was used as a working electrode. Lithium metal was used as a counter and a reference electrode. Sealed beaker cells were used to prevent the evaporation of the electrolyte solvents. The voltage was swept between −0.3 and 0.6V vs Li∕Li+ at a scan rate of 100mVs−1 . The CV was performed at 30, 35, 40, and 45°C . The exchange current density (i0) for the lithium deposition–dissolution process was calculated from the rearranged Allen–Hickling equation15, 16 where i , F , η, R , T , and α are the current density, the Faraday constant, the overvoltage, the ideal gas constant, the absolute temperature, and the asymmetric parameter, respectively. From the Arrhenius plots of i0 , the activation energy [ΔG* (kJmol−1) ] for the desolvation process of the lithium ion was calculated from the following equation16 where Z(=s−1) is the frequency factor and CLi+ is the concentration of the Li+ .

from test: 4 Figure 2a shows the solubility curve for the electrolyte composed of 1M LiPF6 in a ternary mixed solution of EC+DEC+TMMP , and Fig. 2b shows the solubility curve for the electrolyte composed of 1M LiPF6 in a ternary mixed solution of EC+DEC+TPTP . To define the solubility curves in Fig. 2a and 2b, we first prepared various concentrations of mixed solutions and let them stand for 48h at room temperature, and then checked the solutions to see whether they remained in one phase, became clouded, separated, or solidified. The nonflammable region for the TMMP-mixed electrolytes in Fig. 2a was defined by a projection of the results described in the previous paper.1 To define the nonflammable region for the TPTP-mixed electrolytes in Fig. 2a and 2b, we performed flammability tests by placing the gas lighter close to an aluminum pan that contained 2mL of the mixed electrolyte. We defined a region as “flammable” when the electrolytes ignited immediately, and as “self-distinguish” when the electrolytes ignited immediately and the fire was distinguished after putting the gas lighter off. Also, we defined a region as “nonflammable” when the electrolytes did not ignite within 3s . The electrolyte compositions of the test samples were EC+DEC+TPTP (5:95:0 in volume), (5:85:10), (5:75:20), (5:65:30), (5:55:40), and (5:45:50). According to the results of the flammability tests, we divided all the samples into three groups: flammable (TPTP=0 and 10vol% ), self-distinguish (TPTP=20 and 30vol% ), and nonflammable electrolytes (TPTP=40 and 50vol% ). Accordingly, the TPTP shows better compatibility with 1M LiPF6∕EC+DEC and using 50vol% of TPTP in the aimed LiPF6 electrolyte is possible. Such improved solubility is considered to be primarily due to the enhanced miscibility with EC and DEC, because the LiPF6 is insoluble in both neat TPTP and TMMP. Such an enhanced miscibility is due to the higher polarity and higher intermolecular force of TPTP than those of TMMP mentioned previously (see also Table I). For reference we compared this with other compositions such as EC+DEC (50:50) and EC+DEC (5:95) containing 1M LiPF6 .

from test: 5 To evaluate the effects of TPTP addition on the overall battery performance, lithium-ion cells were assembled using the corresponding electrolytes and charge–discharge tests were performed. The obtained discharge capacity at 0.2C for EC+DEC (50:50), EC+DEC (5:95), and EC+DEC+TPTP (5:45:50) were 133, 140, and 129mAhg−1 (per LiCoO2 ), respectively. We calculated the discharge capacity retentions using a ratio of capacity/capacityC∕5 . The calculated discharge capacity retentions at various rates (1, 3, 6, 9, and 12C) are shown in Fig. 3a. The capacity retention for the three electrolytes was almost 100% at 1C. The difference in the capacity retention became significant at 3C and increased when the C rate was raised over 6C. At 12C, the capacity/capacityC∕5 was 20% in the EC+DEC (50:50), 40% in the EC+DEC (5:95), and over 80% in the TPTP-mixed electrolyte. Thus, the cell with the TPTP-mixed electrolyte shows four times higher capacity retention than that with the EC+DEC (50:50) electrolyte. This result indicates that the TPTP shows a similar effect to that of TMMP on the capacity retention at high rates such as 12C. Similar to the TMMP-mixed electrolyte,1 mixing of TPTP decreases the ionic conductivity of the solution yet shows more than twice the capacity retention for EC+DEC (5:95) at 12C. For example, the ionic conductivity for 1M LiBETI/EC+DEC+TPTP (5:95:0) decreased from 2.60to0.76mΩ−1cm−1 by mixing of 50vol% TPTP. This clearly supports our idea that the interfacial kinetic enhancement by TPTP addition far overwhelms the ionic conductivity effect. To compare the enhancement ability of TMMP and TPTP, we also measured the rate capability for the graphite/LiCoO2 cells composed of 1M LiBETI electrolyte systems. The inset of Fig. 3a shows the discharge capacity retention for four electrolyte compositions with and without HFE. The difference in capacity retention among the four electrolytes was clear but not as large as our reported result,1 maybe due to the approximately 1.5 times larger weight of the active material (see caption of Fig. 3) compared to that in the reference.1 A difference at 9C, however, is still significant. The order of the capacity retention at 9C is as follows: (d) EC+DEC+TMMP (60%)(c) EC+DEC+TPTP (56%)(b) EC+DEC (5:95) (53%)(a) EC+DEC (50:50) (42%). The results indicate that the enhanced miscibility of the HFE is inversely proportional to the rate-enhancement ability.

In Fig. 3b the Y -axis represents the discharge capacity ratio, which is the capacity obtained at X°C (capacityX°C) divided by the capacity obtained at 25°C (capacity25°C) . The capacity−20°C∕capacity25°C was 21% for EC+DEC (50:50), 65% for EC+DEC (5:95), and over 95% for EC+DEC+TPTP (5:45:50). Such an excellent low temperature performance for the TPTP-mixed electrolyte is likely due to its low melting point (−98°C) as compared to that of EC (37°C) and DEC (−43°C) (Table I).

from test: 8 We have already observed that TMMP and TPTP improve the battery performances, especially the rate capability. Here we minutely investigate this effect by changing the dosage (10–50vol%) of TMMP in the electrolyte. Figure 5 shows the capacity retention of the graphite/LiCoO2 cells as a function of TMMP dosage (xvol%) in 1M LiBETI/EC+DEC+TMMP [5:95−x:x] at discharge rates of 1–8C. For the electrolyte without TMMP [EC+DEC (5:95)], the capacity retention substantially decreases with an increase in C rate; the drop is significant above 6C. With 10vol% TMMP dosages, the capacity retention improves significantly at rates of 6 and 8C. Further TMMP dosages of 25 and 50vol% steadily increase the capacity retention. Such an increase of the capacity retention vs TMMP concentration suggests that the interfacial effect at the LiCoO2 cathode, the graphite anode, or both is the main factor. Then, the internal resistances (Rint) were evaluated from the initial drop in the discharge curves (see Fig. 5 inset). At 0.2C, the Rint are almost constant for all the electrolytes. At 4 and 8C, the Rint decreases by adding 10vol% TMMP and decreases slightly with a further increase in the TMMP dosage, indicating the interfacial effect of TMMP at the LiCoO2 cathode, the graphite anode, or both.

For graphite/LiCoO2 , the capacity retention was remarkably improved by the addition of the TMMP, especially at higher rates. The same effect was observed for Li∕LiCoO2 . However, for Li/graphite, the capacity retentions for the two electrolytes were almost similar, even worsened by the addition of the TMMP. These results suggest that the discharging properties of the LiCoO2 cathode reflect the whole battery performance.

from test: 10 CV at several temperatures was performed to calculate the activation energy (ΔG*) for the desolvation process of Li+ , which reflects the Rct and Rdiff . A nickel microelectrode was used because of its advantages over conventional electrodes.15, 16 Owing to the small surface area of the microelectrodes, nonfaradaic charge is minimized, and the ohmic drop is very small due to the minute faradaic current (on the order of nanoamperes to microamperes).16 Also, due to the small area of the electrode surface, the current immediately reaches steady state through spherical diffusion.17 In addition, the minute current results in a negligible voltage drop across the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film, which enables us to distinguish between the charge-transfer process of Li+ and the SEI film resistance.16 Figure 7a and 7b shows cyclic voltammograms for a typical lithium deposition–dissolution behavior at each temperature. The reduction peak near −0.3V vs Li∕Li+ corresponds to lithium metal deposition, while the oxidation peak near +0.3V vs Li∕Li+ corresponds to lithium metal dissolution. Using the temperature dependency of the current, the exchange current density (i0) and transfer coefficient (α) were calculated from the rearranged Allen–Hickling equation, Eq. 1, while the activation energy ΔG* was calculated from the Arrhenius plots of the calculated i0 (see inset of Fig. 7).16 The validity of this microelectrode measurement was first verified and calibrated for the common electrolyte, 1M LiPF6∕EC+DEC (50:50), that is widely used in many investigations. The ΔG* results obtained by microelectrode voltammetry and by electrical impedance spectroscopy measurement were compared. In LiPF6 , ΔG* for the Li+ desolvation process was 53.0±4kJmol−1 (microelectrode), which is in the range of generally reported ΔG* values (50–70kJmol−1) .17–20 The values of α were 0.51, close to 0.50, implying a symmetric reaction of the Li∕Li+ couple. Thus, we applied this technique to evaluate ΔG* for 1M LiBETI/(a) EC+DEC (50:50) and (b) the TMMP-mixed electrolyte. The obtained ΔG* for (a) EC+DEC (50:50) and (b) the TMMP-mixed electrolyte was 60.8 and 25.0kJmol−1 , respectively. The low ΔG* (25.0kJmol−1) is due to the destabilization of the solvated Li+ in the presence of the TMMP. Less interaction between Li+ and the solvent (mostly EC) contributes to the high mobility of the lithium ion in the TMMP-mixed electrolyte.

from test: 11 The model curve of Li+ distribution near the LiCoO2 surface is shown in the inset of Fig. 8. At a low discharge rate such as 0.2C, the rate of Li+ consumption is slow. At a high discharge rate such as 12C, the rate of Li+ consumption is rapid and Li+ concentration is very low at the LiCoO2 interface. The high rate ΔG* was obtained with the same Ni microelectrode voltammetry at various concentrations of LiBETI. Figure 8 shows the plots of ΔG* as a function of Li+ concentration. The ΔG* for the EC+DEC varies from 40to100kJmol−1 at 2–0.01mol . It is thought that the higher ΔG* in the low concentration region is caused by the strong solvation, because the number of solvents per Li+ is increased. In the TMMP-mixed electrolyte, ΔG* varies from 30to25kJmol−1 at 2–0.01mol . The ΔG* (25.0–30.0kJmol−1) for the TMMP-mixed electrolyte was very close to the reported ΔG* values (25.0–26.0kJmol−1) for the dimethoxyethane (DME) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) electrolyte at highly oriented pyrolytic graphite.18 These ΔG* values for DME and DMSO are considered to correspond to the ΔG* for the solvated Li+ intercalation, which does not include the Li+ desolvation process. Therefore, such a small ΔG* for the TMMP-mixed electrolyte may strongly reflect the small number of solvation to Li+ in the presence of TMMP, which needs to be exemplified by further experiments.
from Soup: 11 The model curve of Li+ distribution near the LiCoO2 surface is shown in the inset of Fig. 8 . At a low discharge rate such as 0.2C, the rate of Li+ consumption is slow. At a high discharge rate such as 12C, the rate of Li+ consumption is rapid and Li+ concentration is very low at the LiCoO2 interface. The high rate ΔG* was obtained with the same Ni microelectrode voltammetry at various concentrations of LiBETI. Figure 8 shows the plots of ΔG* as a function of Li+ concentration. The ΔG* for the EC+DEC varies from 40to100kJmol−1 at 2–0.01mol . It is thought that the higher ΔG* in the low concentration region is caused by the strong solvation, because the number of solvents per Li+ is increased. In the TMMP-mixed electrolyte, ΔG* varies from 30to25kJmol−1 at 2–0.01mol .

from Soup: 14 Excellent rate capability and low temperature performance were obtained for the TPTP-mixed electrolytes, while the capacity retention was poor in neat carbonate electrolytes. In addition, from the results above, we can summarize the effect of the TMMP on the rate capability as follows: The mixing of TMMP enhanced the discharging property of the LiCoO2 cathode, which reflects the whole battery performance for the graphite/ LiCoO2 cells during the discharge reaction. The results of microelectrode voltammetry measurements show that the mixing of TMMP decreased the activation energy for the Li+ desolvation process, especially at a low concentration of Li+ . A decrement in the activation energy is due to a decrease in solvation number of Li+ by the addition of TMMP, which needs to be exemplified by further experiments such as Raman spectroscopy.

from Soup: 20 In our previous paper, 1 we reported an enhanced rate capability, cyclability, and low temperature performance of Li-ion batteries by using 2-trifluoromethyl-3-methoxyperfluoropentane (TMMP, Fig. 1a ), a branched hydrofluoroether (HFE). We used the TMMP as a mixed solvent with ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC). By adding 50vol% of the TMMP to an electrolyte formulation of 1M lithium bis(pentafluoroethyl sulfonyl)imide (LiBETI) in EC+DEC (5:45), an effective nonflammability and enough antioxidation characteristics were achieved without sacrificing any battery performances. Most importantly, unlike other nonflammable agents reported so far, 2 – 11 the TMMP-mixed electrolyte showed an excellent or even enhanced rate capability (up to 0.2–12C). Also, good cyclability and low temperature performance down to −20°C were demonstrated in the previous paper 1 by adding TMMP in the carbonate-mixed electrolyte. However, the use of the TMMP-mixed electrolyte system for the commercial battery system is hampered because of some disadvantages of LiBETI. Despite the advantage of thermal and hydrolytic stability of LiBETI, the high cost, relatively low conductivity, and the potential threat of corrosion of the aluminum current collector for the LiBETI electrolyte are a problem compared to the LiPF6 electrolyte. 12 – 14 Therefore, the system using lithium hexafluorophosphate ( LiPF6 ) is preferred over the LiBETI system.

from Soup: 21 Using LiPF6 , however, the TMMP dosage in the EC+DEC electrolyte is limited to less than 30vol% , due to low miscibility of the TMMP, although the dosage of more than 50vol% of TMMP is required to have good nonflammability. Such poor LiPF6 solubility stems from the low miscibility of TMMP with EC+DEC (mainly EC) which solvate the lithium ion, whereas lithium salts such as LiBETI and LiPF6 are insoluble in neat TMMP. The low miscibility of the TMMP with other carbonates is due to its low polarity and, presumably, its weak intermolecular dipole and dispersion force. Such a weak intermolecular force of TMMP could be due to its highly fluorinated function group (C6F13–) that possesses strong bonded, inactive C–F bonds, and unpolarizable electron clouds. It could also be expected that the C6F13 – withdraws the electrons of the O atom in the ether bond, thereby reducing O basicity and causing its steric hindrance around the O atom. To achieve better miscibility with the LiPF6∕EC+DEC electrolyte than that for TMMP, it is important to choose an HFE that shows a higher polarity and a higher intermolecular force than those of TMMP.

from Soup: 22 In this study, we investigated a 2-(trifluoro-2-fluoro-3-difluoropropoxy)-3-difluoro-4-fluoro-5-trifluoropentane (TPTP, Fig. 1b ) as an alternative HFE solvent to TMMP. TPTP has a higher dipole moment (3.66D) than that of TMMP (2.36D) as shown in Table I . In addition, TPTP is expected to show a higher intermolecular force because of the lower fluorine per hydrogen ratio ( F∕H ratio=2.0 ) than that of TMMP (4.2). Indeed, with TPTP, using LiPF6 , an effective nonflammable electrolyte composition (50vol%) is possible. Here, we characterize TPTP for its solubility with the LiPF6 electrolyte and its battery performance with both LiPF6 and LiBETI electrolytes. Also, we investigated the rate capability test for the cell composed of graphite/ LiMn2O4 in the TMMP-mixed electrolyte [ 1M LiBETI/ EC+DEC+TMMP (5:45:50)]. Furthermore, we evaluated the influence of HFE on both graphite anodes and LiCoO2 cathodes, and calculated the activation energy for the desolvation process of lithium ion with and without the TMMP solvent.
