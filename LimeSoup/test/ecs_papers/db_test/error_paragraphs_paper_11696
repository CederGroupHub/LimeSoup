from test: 0 Voltage cycling is one of the most damaging stressors for automotive PEMFC. Understanding of the effects of voltage cycling on performance degradation is crucial to improve PEMFC durability for automotive applications. This study focuses on the interaction between upper potential limit (UPL) and lower potential limit (LPL) on the stability of PEMFC. A well-defined peak of degradation rate is observed when the LPL is ∼0.8 V with UPL of 1.35 V. A mathematical model was developed to understand the observed relationship between degradation rate and lower potential. Modeling results suggest that when cycling to a lower potential of ∼0.8 V, almost all dissolved Pt migrate from the catalyst layer to the membrane with negligible re-deposition, resulting in a peak of degradation rate at ∼0.8 V. The amount of Pt in the membrane (PITM) measured at end of life (EOL) samples correlates with degradation rates and is in agreement with modeling results.

The dissolution of Pt is further exacerbated with higher upper potentials. Imai et al. carried out in-situ measurements of Pt oxide at different potentials in aqueous media.16 They observed place exchange phenomenon when the potential was higher than 1.4 V, suggesting Pt could suffer more severe dissolution at such upper potentials. Therefore, it is of great interest to study the impact of parameters in voltage cycling on Pt durability.

from test: 4 The Pt durability can be dependent on many factors, including voltage window (upper potential, lower potential), operation conditions (relative humidity (RH), temperature, gas pressure, etc). The impact of RH and temperature has been investigated and discussed by some publications from Bi et al.17,18 The importance of upper potential on platinum dissolution during voltage cycles has also been studied by many groups. Wang et al. conducted experiments to measure the equilibrium concentration of dissolved Pt at different upper potentials in acidic solution.11 They found the concentration of dissolved Pt increases as potential was increased from 0.85 to 1.15 V. This was attributed to the Pt surface not being fully covered by oxides. When the potential further increases to 1.5 V, they observed that the dissolved Pt concentration decreases which was explained by a passivation effect. However, their experiments only looked at Pt dissolution with constant potential holds, and they did not evaluate the effect of voltage cycling on Pt dissolution. Yasuda et al. performed voltage cycling experiments with voltage windows from 0.1–0.8 V, 0.1–1.0 V and 0.1–1.2 V, respectively.2 Their results showed more Pt surface area loss when cycling to higher potentials. In addition to the upper potential, the cycling profile and ramp rate are also very important parameters affecting Pt durability. Uchimura and Kocha investigated the effect of various cycling profiles on Pt durability.19 Their experiments included square wave and triangular wave, as well as the triangular wave with different anodic and cathodic ramp rates. They concluded that square waves are more damaging on Pt dissolution than triangular waves, and fast anodic and slow cathodic ramp rates are more stressful.

from test: 5 There are few publications on the effect of lower potential on Pt dissolution. Uchimura et al. did voltage cycling experiments with the fixed upper potential at 0.95 V from various lower potentials, i.e. 0.6 V, 0.7 V, 0.75 V and 0.8 V.20 Their results showed more ECA loss with the decreasing lower potential. They theorized that Pt oxidation starts to take place at potentials higher than 0.6 V and reaches a peak at ∼0.8 V. Thus, in cycles from 0.8–0.95 V, the Pt surface is always protected by an oxide layer leading to lower Pt dissolution rates. With cycles between 0.6–0.95 V, the oxide is stripped off every cycle which increases the Pt loss rate. To the authors knowledge voltage cycles above 1.3 V have not been studied.

The image shows there is some platinum depletion in the cathode catalyst layer (CCL) and membrane interface. No CCL thinning is found along all MEA length, indicating carbon corrosion is very minimal. Therefore, Pt oxidation and dissolution should dominate the performance decay.

from test: 12 The results show that when lower potentials ranging from 0.1 V to 0.7 V are applied in the cycle the degradation rate is between 2–4 μV/cycles. There is only a slight increase in degradation rate with lower potentials in this range. With lower potentials above 0.7 V the degradation rises from 4 μV/cycle to a measured maximum of over 15 μV/cycle at 0.8 V. Above 0.8 V the degradation rate drops significantly and is almost negligible at 1.0 V.

from test: 14 Based on Imai et al.'s finding,16 the adsorption of –OH occurs on Pt surface when cycling to 0.95 V, and no place exchange occurs. When potential decreases, PtOH species are reduced and dissolve to form Pt cations. If the lower potential is 0.8 V, there may only be small portion of Pt oxide species reducing and dissolving. Therefore, there will be less Pt dissolution from oxide reduction. When the potential goes up again, Pt dissolution from pure Pt only happens in a small area since a big portion of Pt surface is passivated by Pt oxide. Hence, the overall degradation may be low. If the lower potential is 0.6 V, almost all of oxide can be reduced and leave a fresh Pt surface, which is more susceptible to dissolution when the potential goes up. As a result, the ultimate degradation is much higher than that with lower potential of 0.8 V. This explains the experimental results from Uchimura et al.20

from test: 16 It is further proposed that during voltage cycling the fate of dissolved Pt in the catalyst layer ionomer is different depending on the lower potential of the cycle. Figure 4 is a schematic diagram showing Pt fate during voltage cycling. When Pt or Pt oxide dissolve, Pt cations may diffuse toward membrane, or may re-deposit on fresh Pt surface. Permanent Pt loss is determined by competing effects of diffusion and re-deposition. At potentials of 0.6 V or lower, the platinum surface will be free of oxides. In this case, the free surface area onto which dissolved Pt cations in the ionomer can redeposit is maximized and the re-deposition rate is also maximized. As a result, the overall degradation rate is low. Alternatively, if the lower potential is between 0.75–0.85 V, the Pt surface will have some degree of oxide coverage. As a result, there is a reduced probability of dissolved platinum re-deposition. Consequently, more Pt will migrate away from the catalyst sites into the membrane, ultimately resulting in higher degradation rates. Finally, if the lower potential is between 0.9 V and 1.0 V, Pt surface is always covered with a protective oxide layer. This passivation effect protects Pt from dissolution. Thus, degradation rates are suppressed.

from test: 19 In the current literature typical observations of degradation rate versus cycling potentials show either a linear increase or decrease with respect to the variables. It should be noted that the non-linear behavior observed in these experiments is believed to be caused by an interaction of LPL with UPL. The occurrence of place exchange phenomenon during Pt oxidation at higher upper potential can be the fundamental cause for the difference on the effect of lower potentials on durability between different studies.

from Soup: 28 According to the modeling results, Fig. 6 can be divided into 3 different regions as shown in Fig. 8 , i.e. passivation region, low-redeposition region and high-redeposition region. It is worthwhile to mention that the Pt dissolution follows direct (anodic) dissolution mechanism and it is assumed to be the dominate Pt dissolution mechanisms for the following modeling results, e.g. we assume that reaction rate for chemical dissolution and cathodic dissolution are zeros ( R PtOx,chem. = 0 and R PtOx_reduction = 0).

from test: 29 Based on the model described above, after setting proper boundary conditions: i.e. constant dissolved species concentration and electron potential, zero flux of CPt(2+) and proton at CCL/CGDL and ACL/AGDL), by inputting stressors (e.g. voltage cycling profile), the evolution of surface coverage (θPtOx), Pt ion concentration (CPt(2+)) and Pt mass loss can be predicted. The Pt mass loss is defined as Pt ion flux at CCL and membrane interface:
from Soup: 29 Using the model, the amount of oxide coverage and Pt ion flux from the catalyst layer to the membrane is plotted for three voltage windows: 1.0–1.35 V, 0.8–1.35 V and 0.6–1.35 V. These three cycles are used to illustrate typical behavior.

from Soup: 30 U Lower >1.0 V: Fig. 9 shows the PtO x surface coverage and Pt 2+ flux at CCL/membrane interface for U Lower = 1.0 V with U upper = 1.35 V. The model results show that when U Lower = 1.0 V, the surface oxide coverage is always higher than 1.0 (Fig. 9a ), which means that the surface is always protected by PtO x and the Pt dissolution is negligible. In other words, when U Lower is high enough, the Pt surface remains passivated, therefore, the degradation is very small. Consequently the model also predicts that the flux of platinum ions into the membrane is negligible. It should be noted that the calculated flux at time = 0s is a result of the initial conditions, the initial surface coverage is set to be 0, i.e. clean Pt surface; Therefore, there is an initial flux for first cycle.

from test: 31 According to the modeling results, Fig. 6 can be divided into 3 different regions as shown in Fig. 8, i.e. passivation region, low-redeposition region and high-redeposition region. It is worthwhile to mention that the Pt dissolution follows direct (anodic) dissolution mechanism and it is assumed to be the dominate Pt dissolution mechanisms for the following modeling results, e.g. we assume that reaction rate for chemical dissolution and cathodic dissolution are zeros (RPtOx,chem. = 0 and RPtOx_reduction = 0).
from Soup: 31 0.7 V<U Lower <0.9 V. Fig. 10a – 10c show the evolution of surface coverage of PtO x , Pt 2+ concentration and Pt 2+ flux at CCL/Membrane interface for U Lower = 0.8 V and U Upper = 1.35 V. In Fig. 10c , there are two types of flux: (1) Dissolution flux, which is indicated by the solid arrow in Fig. 10c . If the dissolution flux is positive, it means that Pt ion migrates from CCL to membrane. When Pt dissolution happens, Pt 2+ is generated in the CCL and Pt 2+ is reduced by cross-over H 2 in membrane. There is a Pt 2+ concentration gradient from CCL to membrane. Therefore, when Pt dissolution happens (i.e. voltage increased to 1.35 V), the Pt 2+ flux at CCL/membrane is positive, i.e. from CCL to membrane. Pt mass loss is caused by the dissolution flux. (2) Re-deposition flux: which is negative flux as indicated by dashed green arrow in Fig. 9c . When Pt 2+ re-deposition happens, Pt 2+ in CCL is consumed quickly (as shown in Fig. 9b ). There is a Pt 2+ concentration gradient from membrane to CCL. Therefore, when Pt re-deposition happens, the Pt 2+ flux at CCL/membrane is negative, i.e. from membrane to CCL. Pt mass loss can be partially covered by re-deposition flux. One can also see from Fig. 10c that compared to the dissolution flux, the re-deposition flux is very small, which means that Pt re-deposition is very small for U Lower = 0.8 V and U Upper = 1.35 V. To make re-deposition happen, the following three things are needed: (1) fresh surface for Pt 2+ to be deposited on (PtO x surface coverage is lower than 1). (2) Pt ions (Pt 2+ concentration) and (3) lower-enough potential for cathodic Pt 2+ re-deposition reaction. For U Lower = 0.8 V scenario, according to above analysis, only a narrow window exists for Pt re-deposition, as indicated in Fig. 10 . To make things more clear, there are three different stages exist in one cycle (e.g. 0s < t < 4s): (1) Pt dissolution: when voltage increases to 1.35 V, Pt direct (anodic) dissolution happens, but the dissolution only happens within a very short period of time. When surface coverage is higher than 1.0, the direct dissolution stops due to surface passivation. (2) Pt migration: when surface is passivated, Pt dissolution (Pt 2+ generation) stops, Pt 2+ will migrate from CCL to membrane due to concentration gradient. This stage continues even after potential is decreased to U Lower (0.8 V). Before fresh surface is generated for re-deposition (PtO x surface coverage lower than 1.0), Pt 2+ will continue to migrate. (3) Pt re-deposition: when fresh surface is generated, Pt 2+ will begin to precipitate on the fresh Pt surface, which will cause Pt re-deposition flux. For U Lower = 0.8 V case, there is only a narrow window for Pt re-deposition because the fresh Pt surface is generated slowly at 0.8 V and, when fresh surface is generated, Pt 2+ concentration has already decreased significantly (e.g. reduced from 0.09 μmol/L to 0.03 μmol/L). For those reasons, Pt 2+ re-deposition is negligible, that is why the degradation is very high for U Lower = 0.8 V.

from test: 32 Using the model, the amount of oxide coverage and Pt ion flux from the catalyst layer to the membrane is plotted for three voltage windows: 1.0–1.35 V, 0.8–1.35 V and 0.6–1.35 V. These three cycles are used to illustrate typical behavior.
from Soup: 32 High-deposition region, U Lower <0.7 V. Fig. 11a – 11c show the evolution of surface coverage of PtO x , Pt 2+ concentration and Pt 2+ flux at CCL/Membrane interface for U Lower = 0.6 V with U Upper = 1.35 V. Similar to U Lower = 0.8 V case, two kinds of fluxes and three regions are also found. Compared with U Lower = 0.8 V, the differences are: when U Lower = 0.6 V, fresh surface is generated much faster and Pt re-deposition occurs very quickly after the voltage is changed to lower limit (0.6 V). Also, Pt fresh surface ‘sees’ higher Pt 2+ concentration and more fresh surface is available for Pt re-deposition. For that reason, more Pt re-deposition happens, which can be seen from the more obvious Pt re-deposition flux in Fig. 11c . Therefore, the degradation rate is smaller when U Lower = 0.6 V.
 ###### 
from test: 33 ULower>1.0 V: Fig. 9 shows the PtOx surface coverage and Pt2+ flux at CCL/membrane interface for ULower = 1.0 V with Uupper = 1.35 V. The model results show that when ULower = 1.0 V, the surface oxide coverage is always higher than 1.0 (Fig. 9a), which means that the surface is always protected by PtOx and the Pt dissolution is negligible. In other words, when ULower is high enough, the Pt surface remains passivated, therefore, the degradation is very small. Consequently the model also predicts that the flux of platinum ions into the membrane is negligible. It should be noted that the calculated flux at time = 0s is a result of the initial conditions, the initial surface coverage is set to be 0, i.e. clean Pt surface; Therefore, there is an initial flux for first cycle.
from Soup: 33 Modeling results explained the experimental results satisfactorily. The higher degradation rate for U Lower at around 0.8 V can be attributed to negligible Pt re-deposition and the smaller degradation rate for lower U Lower can be explained by significant Pt re-deposition, which keeps dissolved Pt active as catalyst.

from test: 34 0.7 V<ULower<0.9 V. Fig. 10a–10c show the evolution of surface coverage of PtOx, Pt2+ concentration and Pt2+ flux at CCL/Membrane interface for ULower = 0.8 V and UUpper = 1.35 V. In Fig. 10c, there are two types of flux: (1) Dissolution flux, which is indicated by the solid arrow in Fig. 10c. If the dissolution flux is positive, it means that Pt ion migrates from CCL to membrane. When Pt dissolution happens, Pt2+ is generated in the CCL and Pt2+ is reduced by cross-over H2 in membrane. There is a Pt2+ concentration gradient from CCL to membrane. Therefore, when Pt dissolution happens (i.e. voltage increased to 1.35 V), the Pt2+ flux at CCL/membrane is positive, i.e. from CCL to membrane. Pt mass loss is caused by the dissolution flux. (2) Re-deposition flux: which is negative flux as indicated by dashed green arrow in Fig. 9c. When Pt2+ re-deposition happens, Pt2+ in CCL is consumed quickly (as shown in Fig. 9b). There is a Pt2+ concentration gradient from membrane to CCL. Therefore, when Pt re-deposition happens, the Pt2+ flux at CCL/membrane is negative, i.e. from membrane to CCL. Pt mass loss can be partially covered by re-deposition flux.
from Soup: 34 As a validation of modeling results, we calculated the amount of Pt migrated from CCL to membrane per cycle, and compared with the PITM result shown in Fig. 8 . If assuming all migrated Pt ions are reduced by cross over H 2 , migrated Pt and PITM should be correlated each other. The amount of Pt migrated from CCL to membrane can be determined by integrating Pt 2+ flux at CCL and membrane interface as following:
 ###### 
from test: 35 One can also see from Fig. 10c that compared to the dissolution flux, the re-deposition flux is very small, which means that Pt re-deposition is very small for ULower = 0.8 V and UUpper = 1.35 V. To make re-deposition happen, the following three things are needed: (1) fresh surface for Pt2+ to be deposited on (PtOx surface coverage is lower than 1). (2) Pt ions (Pt2+ concentration) and (3) lower-enough potential for cathodic Pt2+ re-deposition reaction. For ULower = 0.8 V scenario, according to above analysis, only a narrow window exists for Pt re-deposition, as indicated in Fig. 10. To make things more clear, there are three different stages exist in one cycle (e.g. 0s < t < 4s): (1) Pt dissolution: when voltage increases to 1.35 V, Pt direct (anodic) dissolution happens, but the dissolution only happens within a very short period of time. When surface coverage is higher than 1.0, the direct dissolution stops due to surface passivation. (2) Pt migration: when surface is passivated, Pt dissolution (Pt2+ generation) stops, Pt2+ will migrate from CCL to membrane due to concentration gradient. This stage continues even after potential is decreased to ULower (0.8 V). Before fresh surface is generated for re-deposition (PtOx surface coverage lower than 1.0), Pt2+ will continue to migrate. (3) Pt re-deposition: when fresh surface is generated, Pt2+ will begin to precipitate on the fresh Pt surface, which will cause Pt re-deposition flux. For ULower = 0.8 V case, there is only a narrow window for Pt re-deposition because the fresh Pt surface is generated slowly at 0.8 V and, when fresh surface is generated, Pt2+ concentration has already decreased significantly (e.g. reduced from 0.09 μmol/L to 0.03 μmol/L). For those reasons, Pt2+ re-deposition is negligible, that is why the degradation is very high for ULower = 0.8 V.

 ###### 
from test: 36 High-deposition region, ULower<0.7 V. Fig. 11a–11c show the evolution of surface coverage of PtOx, Pt2+ concentration and Pt2+ flux at CCL/Membrane interface for ULower = 0.6 V with UUpper = 1.35 V. Similar to ULower = 0.8 V case, two kinds of fluxes and three regions are also found. Compared with ULower = 0.8 V, the differences are: when ULower = 0.6 V, fresh surface is generated much faster and Pt re-deposition occurs very quickly after the voltage is changed to lower limit (0.6 V). Also, Pt fresh surface ‘sees’ higher Pt2+ concentration and more fresh surface is available for Pt re-deposition. For that reason, more Pt re-deposition happens, which can be seen from the more obvious Pt re-deposition flux in Fig. 11c. Therefore, the degradation rate is smaller when ULower = 0.6 V.
from Soup: 36 Fig. 12 gives the comparison of calculated migrated Pt from CCL to membrane per cycle (Pt loss per cycle) and measured PITM. Fig. 12 shows that the amount of Pt loss per cycle predicted by modeling and the PITM concentration measured by experiments agree with each other very well, which validates the reliability of the Pt dissolution model.
 ###### 
from test: 37 Modeling results explained the experimental results satisfactorily. The higher degradation rate for ULower at around 0.8 V can be attributed to negligible Pt re-deposition and the smaller degradation rate for lower ULower can be explained by significant Pt re-deposition, which keeps dissolved Pt active as catalyst.

 ###### 
from test: 38 As a validation of modeling results, we calculated the amount of Pt migrated from CCL to membrane per cycle, and compared with the PITM result shown in Fig. 8. If assuming all migrated Pt ions are reduced by cross over H2, migrated Pt and PITM should be correlated each other. The amount of Pt migrated from CCL to membrane can be determined by integrating Pt2+ flux at CCL and membrane interface as following:
from Soup: 38 This work examined the effect of cycling potential from various low potentials to 1.35 V on cathode catalyst degradation. SEM images of degraded samples do not show significant thinning, a sign of carbon corrosion, as such the primary source of degradation in these tests was attributed to platinum dissolution. Unlike other studies which typically do not test to high potentials this study found that there was a maximum degradation rate between 0.6 V and 1.0 V with a peak at 0.8 V. EDX measurements also showed increased levels of platinum in the membrane consistent with measured degradation rates with a peak concentration for samples with a lower voltage limit of 0.8 V.
 ###### 
from test: 39 Where mPt is the amount of Pt which migrated from CCL to membrane per cycle, N⃗Pt2+ is the Pt2+ flux at CCL/membrane interface and n is the cycling number from time zero to time t.
from Soup: 39 The peak in degradation rate was attributed to competing passivation and re-deposition effects. When the lower potential was high, platinum is believed to be in a passivated state. As such there is little degradation. As the potential is lowered, the platinum becomes only partially oxidized, this results in higher dissolution rates but low re-deposition rates due to the absence of suitable sites resulting in increasing degradation rates. Once the lower cycling potential becomes low enough, the number of available re-deposition sites increases to a point where re-deposition rates increase, thus the degradation rate decreases.
