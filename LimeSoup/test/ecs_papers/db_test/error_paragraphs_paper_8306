from test: 1 The experiments we are modeling were performed using button cell SOFC disks, and the model geometry we used was a two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric geometry (Fig. 1) similar to that used in our earlier work.13 The two main differences from the earlier geometry are the length of the geometry and the inclusion of ceramic spacers between the inner/inlet tubes and the current collectors.
from Soup: 1 Sulfur compounds in natural gas or crude oil have to be removed before the hydrocarbons can be processed efficiently. In most sulfur removal processes, hydrogen sulfide is the by-product, which then needs to be disposed of safely because is highly toxic to most forms of life. The Claus process 1 is the conventional method used in the industry to convert hydrogen sulfide into elemental sulfur. In the past two decades, there has been a significant amount of experimental research focusing on using as fuel in a high temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). 2 – 8 If successful, these efforts promise an attractive alternative to the Claus process where electric power could be generated while neutralizing this environmental pollutant.

from test: 2 The fuel cell assembly consists of the following components, all of which are considered in the model geometry:
from Soup: 2 The above research has led to the development and investigation of various anode materials that are active in a environment. However, the nature of the electrochemical reaction(s) on these anodes is still unclear, and which chemical species is electro-oxidized at the anode–electrolyte interface is a key question that has not been adequately answered.

 ###### 
from test: 5 The current collectors on both sides. The current collectors in the experiments were made of Au or Pt mesh. We assume that they offer no resistance to flow, and thus, we do not model them explicitly.
from Soup: 5 Some of the above-mentioned studies have attempted to figure out which of the above overall reactions is the predominant one by examining the open-circuit voltage (OCV) 2 , 6 , 9 and by analyzing the anode exhaust gases. 3 , 9 , 10 However, as we have shown in Ref. 11 , 12 , using the OCV as a guide to decide which reaction dominates is nontrivial. A close examination of the literature on SOFCs reveals that except for one previous study, 5 all of them compare experimentally observed OCV values against the unit activity equilibrium voltages for the overall reactions (Eq. 1, 2 ). The OCV should be compared against Nernst potentials for the possible overall electro-oxidation reactions, which in turn requires knowledge of the local fuel composition at the anode.

from Soup: 6 In Ref. 12 , we describe the experiments we conducted to examine the flow-rate and composition effects on SOFC OCV and present a thermodynamic analysis to examine the effect of dissociation on OCV. The experiments were conducted using a button cell configuration with a molybdenum vanadium sulfide anode, a yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, and a Pt cathode. The inlet fuel flow rate was varied from , and the fuel composition was varied using mass flowmeters to test different proportions of , , and . The content was varied from 10 to 100%, while the content was varied from 0 to 40%. The fuel mixtures used were humidified using a room-temperature water bubbler. The experiments were conducted with the fuel cell assembly inside a tube furnace at operating temperatures of 750, 800, and .
 ###### 
from test: 7 The aspect ratio (length/breadth) of the model geometry used is 63. Thus, it is difficult to show the entire geometry. Figure 1 gives a view of the middle of the geometry as well as a close-up of the fuel cell showing the flow in the gas channels. The axis of symmetry is marked using a black dashed–dotted line for the two views. The section above the fuel cell disk is the fuel section, while the section below is the air/ section. The arrows depict the flow patterns in the fuel and oxidant channels.
from Soup: 7 For the experiments above, the fuel cell OCV increased as the inlet (mole fraction of ) was increased in a mixture of and . The OCV also increased as the inlet was increased in a mixture where the inlet was held constant. The fuel flow rate affected the OCV as well. The higher the flow rate, the higher the OCV. The oxidant flow rate had no effect, while affected the OCV in accordance with the Nernst equation.
 ###### 
from test: 8 A three-dimensional (3D) cut-away of the spacers used is also shown in Fig. 1. For the inlet section of both spacers, the inner hole is axisymmetric. For the outer ring of eight inlet holes, we calculated the cross-sectional area available for flow and used it to approximate the ring of holes as a single axisymmetric ring centered at the same radius as the holes. For the outlet, we again calculated the total cross-sectional area of the eight channels on the periphery and approximated the outlet as an axisymmetric ring with the calculated cross-sectional area.
from Soup: 8 The thermodynamic analysis in Ref. 12 allowed us to examine how the equilibrium degree of dissociation varies with inlet composition and reaction temperature. A Nernst potential can be defined for all the possible overall oxidation reactions in the fuel cell. Although the Nernst potentials are identical for all possible electrochemical reactions when the fuel is at chemical equilibrium, this is not the case if the fuel is not at equilibrium. We defined and calculated the Nernst potentials for some of the possible oxidation reactions to examine the effect of an incomplete dissociation on these Nernst potentials. This analysis suggested that Reaction 1 and not Reaction 2 is the dominant overall electrochemical reaction for the anode material we used.
 ###### 
from test: 9 The 2D model we present here is an extension of the models in Ref. 13. In addition to solving for flow, mass transfer, and charge transport, the models in this work also take heat transfer, dissociation in the fuel, and multiple electrochemical reactions at the anode into account. Thus, the governing equations solved in these models include (i) the weakly compressible Navier–Stokes equations and the Brinkman equation for velocity and pressure in the flow channels and electrodes, respectively, (ii) the Maxwell–Stefan convection–diffusion mass-transfer equations for the mass fractions of , , and on the fuel side and on the air side, (iii) the general heat-transfer equation for temperature in the entire fuel cell assembly, and (iv) the Laplace equation (Ohm’s law) for the voltage/current distribution in the electrodes and electrolyte.
from Soup: 9 The above described thermodynamic analysis cannot be used to give quantitative results for the dependence of OCV on composition and flow rate or to model the current density–voltage ( ) performance curves for a SOFC. In an earlier work, 13 we presented multiphysics models for a SOFC, the most comprehensive of which was a coupled model including flow and multicomponent mass transfer in the gas channels and electrodes, and the current and potential distributions in the electrodes and electrolyte. However, those models cannot be used for the experiments we wish to simulate here because ( i ) fuel dissociation chemistry was not included and ( ii ) measured OCV was used instead of calculating a Nernst potential because the concentrations of the product species for the electrochemical reaction were unknown.
 ###### 
from test: 10 Both electrodes for the fuel cells being modeled in this work were electronic conductors; i.e., the electrodes in the experiments were not composite or mixed conducting electrodes. Thus, the electrochemical reactions at the electrodes are restricted to the electrode–electrolyte boundary and are incorporated using the boundary conditions. The governing partial differential equations and the boundary conditions for the 2D model are given below.
from Soup: 10 To model the flow-rate and composition effects on fuel cell performance observed in our experiments correctly, we need models that can predict the OCV and the electrochemical performance of the fuel cell. To calculate these, we need local concentrations of the electrochemically active species at the anode and the cathode. Although the inlet oxidant composition can be used as the composition at the cathode (under open-circuit conditions), the in the fuel dissociates in the fuel inlet channel, which means the fuel composition at the anode is not the same as the inlet fuel composition even at open-circuit conditions. To calculate the fuel composition at the anode, we need to model the fuel dissociation in the fuel channel and anode correctly. As the dissociation reaction is a strong function of temperature, we need the temperature profile on the fuel side of the fuel cell assembly to calculate the reaction rate. Because the temperature profile on the fuel side cannot be calculated in isolation from the rest of the fuel cell assembly, we need to solve the heat-transfer problem throughout the assembly. Also, the above link between the fuel chemistry and the temperature distribution is a two-way link as the dissociation reaction is endothermic. Thus, the local temperature in the fuel channel/anode is dependent on the local rate of reaction, and the local rate of reaction is dependent on the local temperature. To assess the degree of coupling between the thermal model and the dissociation reaction chemistry as well as to answer questions such as whether the gas flow rate affects cell temperature directly by cooling the cell, we need to extend the fuel cell models presented in Ref. 13 by including the following capabilities:

The above switching of terms between the free flow subdomain and the porous subdomain eliminates the need to specify boundary conditions at the interface of the two subdomains.

This is to be expected because as the content in the fuel is increased, the equilibrium dissociation of goes down drastically. 12 The lower the equilibrium extent of reaction, the quicker the approach to equilibrium. Thus, the reaction is no longer kinetically controlled as it is close to equilibrium, as seen here for .

from test: 103 Figure 7 shows the variation in cell temperature with increasing fuel flow rate. The cell temperature (averaged over the anode–fuel channel interface) decreases with increasing fuel flow, but the change in temperature for an increase in flow from 50 to 100 mL/min is only (for the model that includes internal surface radiative heat exchange, while for the model that does not include internal radiation). Thus, one of the conjectures to explain a flow-rate dependence of OCV, that the cell is cooled by increasing the fuel flow-rate, is unfounded as varying the fuel flow rate in the 50–100 mL/min range is not expected to cool the cell enough to cause a measurable change in the Nernst potential.

from test: 105 Although there has been a significant amount of work on SOFCs that can use as fuel, those works were primarily experimental in character and were focused on identifying and evaluating anode materials for SOFCs. In this paper, we presented a comprehensive multiphysics model for a SOFC that takes all the important transport phenomena, fuel chemistry, and electrochemistry at both electrodes into account. The fuel chemistry model used as well as the electrochemistry models developed are thermodynamically consistent, which allow us to calculate cell OCV in a theoretically consistent manner. The multiphysics model incorporating the above submodels allows us to simulate the experiments summarized in Ref. 11, 12 and helps us to answer some fundamental questions that are inadequately addressed in the literature despite over two decades of research in the field.

This ability to directly oxidize should have a significant impact on the utilization efficiency and power density of -fueled SOFCs. Further experimental and modeling work are needed to test the long-term durability of anodes using this material.

from test: 107 The models developed here allow us to consider simultaneous and oxidations and to simulate the combined/mixed fuel OCV and curves giving the contribution to the total current by each component. Although several researchers39–42 have developed and used mixed potential models for direct methanol fuel cells, this work is among the first to use thermodynamically consistent multiphysics models to calculate the mixed OCV and mixed potential curves for an SOFC. The model formulation and development is general and can be used to simulate the performance of any multifuel fuel cell. This ability allows us to predict changes in performance that depend on which fuel components are electrochemically active. An important future application for such a model would be to simulate low and intermediate temperature SOFCs operated on hydrocarbon fuels, which contain more than one electrochemically active species such as CO and .
from Soup: 107 The upper plot in Fig. 6 shows the total current density vs cell voltage curve as well as the individual current density curves due to and oxidation. The lower plot is a close-up of the low current region of the curves and illustrates how the OCV for a mixed fuel is the cell voltage where the sum of the currents due to the different fuels is zero. As expected, the mixed OCV lies between the Nernst potentials for and oxidation. However, the Nernst potentials for the two fuels, calculated using the local fuel composition, are different from the cell voltages where the corresponding fuel currents go to zero. This interesting behavior is a consequence of the two electrochemical reactions at the anode occurring simultaneously, thus being subject to the same anode potential.

from test: 110 Sulfur compounds in natural gas or crude oil have to be removed before the hydrocarbons can be processed efficiently. In most sulfur removal processes, hydrogen sulfide is the by-product, which then needs to be disposed of safely because is highly toxic to most forms of life. The Claus process1 is the conventional method used in the industry to convert hydrogen sulfide into elemental sulfur. In the past two decades, there has been a significant amount of experimental research focusing on using as fuel in a high temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).2–8 If successful, these efforts promise an attractive alternative to the Claus process where electric power could be generated while neutralizing this environmental pollutant.

from test: 114 Some of the above-mentioned studies have attempted to figure out which of the above overall reactions is the predominant one by examining the open-circuit voltage (OCV)2, 6, 9 and by analyzing the anode exhaust gases.3, 9, 10 However, as we have shown in Ref. 11, 12, using the OCV as a guide to decide which reaction dominates is nontrivial. A close examination of the literature on SOFCs reveals that except for one previous study,5 all of them compare experimentally observed OCV values against the unit activity equilibrium voltages for the overall reactions (Eq. 1, 2). The OCV should be compared against Nernst potentials for the possible overall electro-oxidation reactions, which in turn requires knowledge of the local fuel composition at the anode.

from test: 115 In Ref. 12, we describe the experiments we conducted to examine the flow-rate and composition effects on SOFC OCV and present a thermodynamic analysis to examine the effect of dissociation on OCV. The experiments were conducted using a button cell configuration with a molybdenum vanadium sulfide anode, a yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, and a Pt cathode. The inlet fuel flow rate was varied from , and the fuel composition was varied using mass flowmeters to test different proportions of , , and . The content was varied from 10 to 100%, while the content was varied from 0 to 40%. The fuel mixtures used were humidified using a room-temperature water bubbler. The experiments were conducted with the fuel cell assembly inside a tube furnace at operating temperatures of 750, 800, and .

from test: 116 For the experiments above, the fuel cell OCV increased as the inlet (mole fraction of ) was increased in a mixture of and . The OCV also increased as the inlet was increased in a mixture where the inlet was held constant. The fuel flow rate affected the OCV as well. The higher the flow rate, the higher the OCV. The oxidant flow rate had no effect, while affected the OCV in accordance with the Nernst equation.
from test: 117 The thermodynamic analysis in Ref. 12 allowed us to examine how the equilibrium degree of dissociation varies with inlet composition and reaction temperature. A Nernst potential can be defined for all the possible overall oxidation reactions in the fuel cell. Although the Nernst potentials are identical for all possible electrochemical reactions when the fuel is at chemical equilibrium, this is not the case if the fuel is not at equilibrium. We defined and calculated the Nernst potentials for some of the possible oxidation reactions to examine the effect of an incomplete dissociation on these Nernst potentials. This analysis suggested that Reaction 1 and not Reaction 2 is the dominant overall electrochemical reaction for the anode material we used.
from test: 118 The above described thermodynamic analysis cannot be used to give quantitative results for the dependence of OCV on composition and flow rate or to model the current density–voltage ( ) performance curves for a SOFC. In an earlier work,13 we presented multiphysics models for a SOFC, the most comprehensive of which was a coupled model including flow and multicomponent mass transfer in the gas channels and electrodes, and the current and potential distributions in the electrodes and electrolyte. However, those models cannot be used for the experiments we wish to simulate here because (i) fuel dissociation chemistry was not included and (ii) measured OCV was used instead of calculating a Nernst potential because the concentrations of the product species for the electrochemical reaction were unknown.
from test: 119 To model the flow-rate and composition effects on fuel cell performance observed in our experiments correctly, we need models that can predict the OCV and the electrochemical performance of the fuel cell. To calculate these, we need local concentrations of the electrochemically active species at the anode and the cathode. Although the inlet oxidant composition can be used as the composition at the cathode (under open-circuit conditions), the in the fuel dissociates in the fuel inlet channel, which means the fuel composition at the anode is not the same as the inlet fuel composition even at open-circuit conditions. To calculate the fuel composition at the anode, we need to model the fuel dissociation in the fuel channel and anode correctly. As the dissociation reaction is a strong function of temperature, we need the temperature profile on the fuel side of the fuel cell assembly to calculate the reaction rate. Because the temperature profile on the fuel side cannot be calculated in isolation from the rest of the fuel cell assembly, we need to solve the heat-transfer problem throughout the assembly. Also, the above link between the fuel chemistry and the temperature distribution is a two-way link as the dissociation reaction is endothermic. Thus, the local temperature in the fuel channel/anode is dependent on the local rate of reaction, and the local rate of reaction is dependent on the local temperature. To assess the degree of coupling between the thermal model and the dissociation reaction chemistry as well as to answer questions such as whether the gas flow rate affects cell temperature directly by cooling the cell, we need to extend the fuel cell models presented in Ref. 13 by including the following capabilities:
from test: 120 Modeling the heat transfer and thus the temperature profile in the fuel cell assembly.
from test: 121 Modeling the dissociation reaction in the fuel cell assembly to calculate the fuel composition at the anode.
from test: 122 Predicting the OCV of the cell as well as the electrochemical reaction rates using the local gas phase compositions at the anode and cathode.
