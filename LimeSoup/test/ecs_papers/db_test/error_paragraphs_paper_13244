As a first step, in the following chapters and sections, (i) we consider possible major electrode reactions with non-charged species. This is the simplest way, whilst most of the adsorbed species may be charged on electrodes (especially on cathodes) of strongly ionic character and some of these reactions considered may not be regarded as elementary steps.

from test: 25 The approximated relations can be derived in the same way, as compiled in Table X, describing the major relations of cathode exchange current density for given species involved in electrochemical reactions and boundary conditions. Figure 6 also summarizes the partial pressure dependence of cathode exchange current density, i0, c. By comparing this figure (Fig. 6) for the charged oxygen species with Fig. 3 for the neutral oxygen species, it can be found that the partial pressure dependence of i0, c also varies by varying the kind of adsorbates and boundary condition. Similarly to the dependence for the neutral adsorbates (Fig. 3), the partial pressure dependence for the charged adsorbates ranges from − 3/4 to 1/2 (Fig. 6). It is also distinguished that a positive pO2(C) dependence is obtained for a low total coverage (θV(C)≅1), which is also common for the cases with the neutral adsobates. In addition, identical pO2(C) dependence has been obtained for the similar species with and without charge for the same given boundary condition. For example, for the boundary condition of θV(C)≅1, the same 1/2 power dependence is obtained for O2ad in Fig. 3 and for O2ad and O−2ad in Fig. 6. For this same boundary condition, the same 1/4 power dependence is also obtained for Oad in Fig. 3 and for O−ad in Fig. 6. By comparing the dependencies with and without charge, these figures suggest the identical pO2(C) dependence, which is independent of the charge of the adsorbates. It should be noted here that the coverage of charged absorbates could not approach the unity due to their electrostatic interactions so that the cases with such boundary conditions may not be probable.

Such simulation has been made for the typical cases, namely, for the neutral adsorbates with α⃗=α←=0.5. The simulation results for different electrochemical rate-determining reactions at cathodes are shown in Fig. 11. In this figure, it is assumed that air utilization is 0% at the oxygen partial pressure (pO2(C)) of 0.21 atm in the ambient air, and i0, c is normalized to be the unity (one) at this oxygen partial pressure.

Such simulation has been made for the typical cases, namely, for the neutral adsorbates with α⃗=α←=0.5. The simulation results for different electrochemical rate-determining reactions at cathodes are shown in Fig. 11 . In this figure, it is assumed that air utilization is 0% at the oxygen partial pressure ( pO2(C)) of 0.21 atm in the ambient air, and i 0, c is normalized to be the unity (one) at this oxygen partial pressure. We can see that partial pressure dependence varies for different predominant adsorption species and different boundary conditions, even if the same electrochemical reaction takes place.

from test: 33 The coverages of oxygen species may be low and thus vacant sites are predominant (θV(C)≅1) at a lower oxygen partial pressure near air outlet especially at a higher operational temperature. In such cases, it is expected that i0, c decreases with increasing air utilization, i.e., with decreasing oxygen partial pressure (as shown in Fig. 11(a)–11(c) for θV(C)≅1). On the other hand, the coverages of adsorbed oxygen atom or molecules could be predominantly high at higher oxygen partial pressure near air inlet, at a lower operational temperature, and/or at a higher total pressure. In such cases, it is expected that i0, c increases with increasing air utilization, i.e., with deceasing oxygen partial pressure because of an increase in the number vacant active sites (see Fig. 11(a) for θO2(C)≅1 and θO(C)≅1, and Fig. 11(b) for θO2(C)≅1). In general, since SOFCs operate at a high temperature, it should be noted that a large negative entropy of adsorption will usually lead to lower adsorbate coverages56–59 so that the case with the coverage around the unity will be exceptional.

from test: 36 In both for the cathodes and for the anodes, higher value of forward and backward reactions are required to obtain higher exchange current densities which represent the activity of the electrodes. Therefore, as summarized in Table IV and Table VI, the product of current density for the forward and the backward reactions should be high for more active electrode. Since these factors include the coverages, partial pressure dependence of exchange current densities varies for different degree of the coverages. The coverages could vary depending on operational temperature, gas partial pressure, electrode and electrolyte materials involved in the electrochemical reaction, elementary reaction species and chemical state of outermost surfaces of these materials, and impurities covering electrode surfaces to prevent adsorption of certain species. In addition, defect concentrations appearing in the rate equations have certain oxygen partial pressure dependencies as well known in defect chemistry for ionic and electronic defects. Such pO2 dependence may even differ between the bulk and the surface.55 Scattered exchange current density values reported and their partial pressure dependencies can be well expected and understood based on these theoretical considerations.

from Soup: 43 Applicability of the Butler-Volmer type expression : It may be impossible to conclude universal reaction mechanisms of SOFC electrodes as pointed out by Mogensen et al., 22 partly because electrode kinetics are affected to a large degree by e.g. purity of the raw materials of the electrode and the electrolyte, manufacturing history, microstructure, impurities present on the surface and at the TPB, and various operating conditions. The distribution of overvoltage may not be negligible depending on the distance from the bulk electrolyte surface into the porous electrode structure having a certain thickness. Therefore, it may be difficult to explain all of the electrode reactions using the Butler-Volmer equation which assumes one rate-determining reaction. 22 Indeed, partial pressure dependencies of exchange current density theoretically derived in this study suggest that exchange current density values can vary strongly for different rate-determining electrochemical reactions and predominant adsorption species even for a given rate-determining electrochemical reaction, as summarized in Figs. 3 , 4 , and 6 to 10 . The values of exchange current density experimentally determined and reported in the literature 18 – 21 , 44 are relatively scattered also indicating that exchange current density values can be affected by many factors, as mentioned above. Experimental data on SOFC exchange current density have been compiled in Ref. 44, where it was generally difficult to derive or conclude electrode reaction mechanisms and elementary reactions. We should also note that the Butler-Volmer equation, derived for the situation in liquid electrochemistry cannot simply be transferred to SOFC electrodes. 53 In liquid electrochemistry, a supporting liquid electrolyte solution is present. However, at SOFC electrodes, no such electrolyte is available at the gas-solid electrode. The electrical potential drop at the surface, which may affect the kinetics of rate-determining steps, is thus not necessarily identical to the applied overpotential. 53 , 71 Charged adsorbates will create an additional electrical potential drop at the surface. Due to such additional complications, the physical meaning of extracted parameters such as the transfer coefficient may differ from the simple Butler-Volmer theory, whilst the Butler-Volmer expression can phenomenologically represent electrode behavior especially in a limited bias range. Such fundamental questions on electrochemistry in solid versus liquid state have been important scientific issues since decades, 71 which should be discussed and clarified in the future.

Indeed, surface reaction models of the Temkin-type have been applied in considering sulfur poisoning on the Ni anode surface. 64 In addition, if charged adsorbates are predominate on the electrode surfaces, the electrostatic interaction among such charged species may no longer be negligible, affecting the dependencies, especially at higher surface adsorbate coverages.

However, Eqs. 7 and 8 (and several other similarly complex reactions e.g. Eq. 15 where two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen ion would have to meet) are overall reaction equations comprising far too many particles (e.g. 4 electrons) to be an elementary reaction step. Two electron transfers may typically occur in two separate steps. For the rate expressions to be meaningful, the rate-determining step must be an elementary reaction. This also applies to the reverse reaction. If it contains more than 3 particles, it may be also highly improbable to be elementary. 55 In order to consider this, more elementary processes have to be considered as for the dissociation of oxygen molecules, as described for the charged oxygen species in Eqs. 40 , 41 , and 42 .
