from test: 0 The possibility of replacing λ-MnO2 with previously used γ-MnO2 in the positive electrodes of fuel cell/battery (FCB) systems was analyzed. Samples were evaluated in three different modes: In fuel cell mode, the oxygen reduction reaction rate was measured at an elevated pressure of 1.0 MPa. In battery mode, the electrodes were electrochemically cycled at different rates to assess their proton diffusion. Finally, in FCB mode, the discharged electrodes were chemically charged with oxygen for one hour to quantify the chemical charge rate. For all modes, X-ray diffraction analysis was conducted to assess the crystal stability of both species. λ-MnO2 was found to exhibit a considerably better catalytic capability for oxygen reduction reaction and could be chemically charged more quickly with oxygen than γ-MnO2. It is proposed that these results were caused by a lower charge transfer resistance in λ-MnO2. However, γ-MnO2 showed better proton diffusivity than λ-MnO2, mainly owing to its higher surface area. In terms of crystal stability, λ-MnO2 was found to be superior to γ-MnO2, thus making it a promising positive electrode material for FCB systems.

from test: 1 A novel electrochemical system with a of power generation and energy storage dual function, referred to as a fuel cell/battery (FCB) system, was proposed in our previous work.1–3 The FCB system consists of a metal hydride (MH) negative electrode and a manganese dioxide (MnO2) positive electrode in an alkaline electrolyte. In the negative electrode of the FCB system, the metal hydride can be electrochemically charged as shown in the following reaction:
from Soup: 1 Both the γ-MnO 2 and λ-MnO 2 used in this work were based on commercially available materials. Electrolytic γ-MnO 2 manganese dioxide (EMD, Tosoh Corp., Japan) was used as received. λ-MnO 2 was obtained by chemical delithiation of LiMn 2 O 4 (BET surface area: 0.4 m 2 /g, Mitsui Kinzoku, Japan) in a 0.1 M nitric acid solution for 24 h under stirring. 16 This treatment removed the lithium ions from the crystal lattice of the LiMn 2 O 4 without damaging its spinel structure. Slurries of the active materials were prepared by mixing carbon black (CB, 50 nm diameter, Mitsubishi Chemical, Japan) and MnO 2 with ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA, Tosoh Corp.) in ca. 100°C xylene solution at a weight ratio of MnO 2 :CB:EVA = 100:15:10. The slurry was pasted onto a 500-μm-thick nickel foam, dried in air at room temperature for 24 h, and pressed at 40 MPa to obtain 2 cm × 4 cm-sized electrodes. The MnO 2 loading of all samples was between 12 and 16 mg/cm 2 . Three-electrode cells were assembled with the active electrode, a nickel foam counter electrode, and an Hg/HgO reference electrode. A porous 120-μm-thick polypropylene sheet and a 6-M KOH solution were used as separator and electrolyte, respectively.
 ###### 
from test: 2 Additionally, the metal hydride can be rapidly charged with hydrogen gas as follows:4
from Soup: 2 Figure 2 shows the experimental set-up used for chemical charging with oxygen and ORR tests. Oxygen was supplied via a tube (0.8-mm diameter) that was inserted close to the active electrode. The set-up enabled the oxygen to be supplied at an elevated pressure (1 MPa), which was previously found to accelerate the regeneration process. 7 The oxygen was supplied at a flow rate of 10 mL/min in all cases.
 ###### 
from test: 3 The charged MH can then be discharged electrochemically. This reaction is equivalent to the reverse of reaction.1 MH can thus work as a negative electrode in a FCB system because it can function as a negative electrode in (a) fuel cell mode, in which it works as a hydrogen oxidation catalyst, (b) battery mode, in which it is electrochemically redox cycled, and (c) FCB mode, in which the metal hydride is chemically charged with hydrogen (Eq. 2) and then electrochemically discharged according to a battery electrode.4
from Soup: 3 In all experiments, a discharge cutoff voltage of –0.4 V vs. Hg/HgO was implemented.
 ###### 
from test: 4 In the positive electrode of the FCB system, MnO2 has been found to be a promising material to enable the three aforementioned operating modes.2 The main reactions of the three operating modes occurring at the positive electrode of the FCB system are summarized in Fig. 1.
from Soup: 4 The crystal structures of the MnO 2 samples were analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD; Cu Kα radiation, XRD Miniflex, Rigaku Corp., Japan). The diffraction patterns were measured between θ/2θ = 10° and 80°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Tabletop Microscope TM3030, Hitachi-Hitec, Japan) was used to further characterize the morphology of the samples. The average specific surface area of the MnO 2 samples was determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption method (Belsorp-max, BEL Japan). Electrochemical tests, namely cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge analysis, were conducted with a galvanostat/potentiostat (Analytical 1480 Multistat, Solartron) at 25°C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using a frequency response analyzer (1255B, Solartron). The frequency response was measured between 0.01 Hz and 100 kHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV and a scan rate of 10 points per decade.
 ###### 
from test: 5 (a) Fuel cell mode: In fuel cell mode, the MnO2 positive electrode functions as a catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Thus, the surface activity is crucial in this mode. It has been described previously that the two overall pathways of ORR that take place in alkaline electrolyte are as follows:5
from Soup: 5 Figures 3a and 3b show the XRD patterns of γ- and λ-MnO 2 , respectively. All of the peaks of γ- and λ-MnO 2 were found to be present without any impurity peaks. Furthermore, the intensity of the γ-MnO 2 peaks was found to be well below the intensity of those of λ-MnO 2 , indicating a higher crystallinity for the latter.
 ###### 
from test: 6 Direct 4-electron pathway:
from Soup: 6 The SEM images of the γ-MnO 2 and λ-MnO 2 samples are shown in Figs. 4a and 4b , respectively. Both the γ-MnO 2 and λ-MnO 2 samples were observed to contain particles of up to several micrometers in diameter. The particles of γ-MnO 2 had various shapes, whereas most of the λ-MnO 2 particles were well-shaped octahedra. The measured BET surface area of the λ-MnO 2 sample (14.5 m 2 /g) was lower than that of the γ-MnO 2 sample (51.5 m 2 /g). This was caused by the smooth surface of the particles in the λ-MnO 2 sample.
 ###### 
from test: 7 (2 + 2)-electron pathway (peroxide pathway):
from Soup: 7 The CV curves of γ- and λ-MnO 2 measured at a cycling rate of 0.1 mV/sec for 5 loops between −0.4 V and 0.5 V vs. Hg/HgO are shown in Fig. 5 . Both the reduction and oxidation peaks of γ-MnO 2 were observed to become weaker in intensity as the cycle number increased, indicating degradation of the γ-MnO 2 . Furthermore, in case of γ-MnO 2 , two oxidation and reduction peaks were observed which may be attributable to phase transformations between γ- and δ-MnO 2 . 19 In contrast, the intensity of the peaks of λ-MnO 2 remained comparatively stable, indicating a slow degradation of λ-MnO 2 . The intensity of the peaks was however weaker than those of γ-MnO 2 which indicates better proton diffusion of the latter. It was found that toward 0.5 V vs. Hg/HgO, bubbles were created which was likely caused by oxygen evolution reaction. Thus, the charge cutoff potential for both γ- and λ-MnO 2 in battery mode (electrochemical charge/discharge cycling) was set at 0.5 V vs. Hg/HgO.
 ###### 
from test: 8 This reaction is then either followed by a further reduction reaction: or the decomposition reaction:
from Soup: 8 To evaluate the ORR in fuel cell mode, the samples were first fully discharged at 0.1 C to −0.4 V vs. Hg/HgO for γ-MnO 2 and then exposed to oxygen flow for 5 h to re-oxidize their surface and achieve a stable voltage. These two steps were conducted to allow for a better comparison between fuel cell mode and FCB mode, as in FCB mode, the electrodes also had to be electrochemically discharged prior to chemical oxygen charge. Thereafter, a constant current was applied at different C-rates (from 0.01 C to 1 C) while oxygen was supplied. The resulting curves of γ- and λ-MnO 2 are shown in Fig. 6 . Because it was found that the potential did not immediately reach the final set potential but levelled off only after a few minutes, every current was applied for 1 h, which was found to be sufficient to achieve a constant potential. The reason for this slow stabilization was the intrinsic storage capacity of MnO 2 . At the beginning of each step, electrochemical discharge was likely to be dominant before ORR led to a constant potential.
 ###### 
from test: 9 (b) Battery mode: In battery mode, MnO2 serves as the active material. MnO2 in the positive electrode can be electrochemically reduced to MnOOH (discharge) and re-oxidized to MnO2 (charge) as follows:3,6
from Soup: 9 The resulting I-V curves of the ORR experiments are shown in Fig. 7 where all the current rates which did not hit the cutoff voltage are shown. It was found that γ-MnO 2 could be discharged at a current density of 7.0 mA/cm 2 (equivalent to 0.2 C) without hitting the cutoff potential. At 7.0 mA/cm 2 , a potential of −0.182 V vs. Hg/HgO was measured. When the current was increased to 17.5 mA/cm 2 (0.5 C), the cutoff potential of −0.4 V vs. Hg/HgO was reached after 11 min. In contrast, λ-MnO 2 exhibited a higher oxygen reduction rate. Even at 17.5 mA/cm 2 (0.5 C), a steady potential of −0.101 V vs. Hg/HgO was observed in spite of the considerably smaller surface area of the material. At 35.0 mA/cm 2 (1 C), the cutoff potential was reached after 24 min.
 ###### 
from test: 10 In contrast to fuel cell mode, fast proton diffusion is crucial in battery mode to enable rapid electrochemical redox cycling.
from Soup: 10 In a previous study by Lima et al., 20 it was proposed that the electron transfer from MnO 2 to the adsorbed oxygen is the rate limiting step during ORR. This means that the charge transfer resistance is a crucial factor during ORR. To quantify the charge transfer resistance of the materials, EIS measurements were conducted on the electrodes after their complete discharge. Figure 8 shows the EIS measurement results for fully discharged γ- and λ-MnO 2 . For simulation purposes, an equivalent circuit model consisting of an uncompensated solution resistance (R sol ), a charge transfer resistance (R ct ), and two constant phase elements (CPE) was used according based on the work of Bailey et al. 21 R sol and R ct are the solution resistance from the reference electrode to the MnO 2 electrode current collector and the resistance of charge transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface, respectively. The results of the simulation showed that λ-MnO 2 had a considerably lower charge transfer resistance (1.31 Ω) than γ-MnO 2 (7.03 Ω), thus verifying that the faster ORR rate of λ-MnO 2 arose from its lower charge transfer resistance.
 ###### 
from test: 11 (c) Fuel cell/battery mode: In the positive electrode of FCB systems, it has been described that MnOOH, which is formed by discharge of MnO2, can be chemically recharged by oxygen (regeneration with oxygen) as follows:2,7,8
from Soup: 11 After ORR analysis, the crystal structure of the samples was analyzed by XRD to evaluate the crystal durability of each material. As shown in Fig. 9a , after ORR with γ-MnO 2 , the original peaks of γ-MnO 2 were still observable without any impurity peaks. The decreased intensity can be assigned to the binder that likely covered the MnO 2 particles and amorphization of the electroactive material. 2 In contrast, in the case of λ-MnO 2 , formation of δ-MnO 2 was observed, but the original peaks assignable to the λ-structure are fairly intense wherefore it is likely that amorphization occurred to a lesser extent than in γ-MnO 2 .
 ###### 
from test: 12 After this regeneration, the MnO2 can then be electrochemically discharged according to reaction 7.
from Soup: 12 The electrochemical redox cycling performance of γ- and λ-MnO 2 was investigated under battery mode at charge/discharge rates of 0.1C/0.1C, 0.2C/0.2C, 0.2C/0.5C, 0.2C/1.0C, 0.2C/2.0C, and 0.2C/5.0C. The charge and discharge capacities of both γ-MnO 2 and λ-MnO 2 during 36 cycles at different charge and discharge rates are shown in Fig. 10 . The capacity of both electrodes decreased during the first cycles at 0.1 C/0.1 C. The subsequent cycles showed reasonably good capacity retention at the same charge/discharge rate, but the capacity decreased as the discharge rate was increased. A more significant capacity reduction was observed in the case of λ-MnO 2 . During charge/discharge cycling at 0.2C/0.5C, the discharge capacity of λ-MnO 2 was only half that observed for γ-MnO 2 , whereas at during subsequent 0.1C/0.1C charge/discharge cycles, the capacities of both samples were similar and recovered to 66.3% (λ-MnO 2 ) and 70.7% (γ-MnO 2 ).
 ###### 
from test: 13 Several different MnO2 crystal structures exist, such as 1D tunnel structures (α-, β-, and γ-MnO2), a layered structure (δ-MnO2), and a 3D tunnel structure (λ-MnO2). Research for ORR in alkaline fuel cells has primarily focused on 1D and layered structures.9–12 It was reported that α- and δ-MnO2 exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity than other MnO2 crystal structures, such as β-MnO2. However, in battery mode, we found that both α- and δ-MnO2 show poor redox reaction cyclability because of the formation of Mn3O4.13 Furthermore, δ-MnO2 is known to show poor structural stability during electrochemical cycling due to expansion and shrinkage of the crystal.14 As an alternative, our group has used γ-MnO2 for the application in FCB systems because this crystal structure was found to have a good redox reaction cyclability if the discharge was cutoff at a potential of −0.4 V vs. Hg/HgO.2,7,15 Only when a low discharge potential of −0.9 V vs. Hg/HgO was set, inactive Mn3O4 was formed, leading to poor redox reaction cyclability.2 However, the reaction rate of chemical charging (Eq. 8) was observed to be very slow. The chemical charging of a γ-MnO2 positive electrode with oxygen for 1 h only oxidized ca. 13% of the MnOOH.2
from Soup: 13 It also has to be noted that during the first cycles, the charged capacity was lower than the discharged capacity, particularly in case of λ-MnO 2 . This resulted in an apparent Coulombic efficiency of above 100%. The reason for this observation is suggested to be due to incomplete discharge during the first cycle. During the first discharge, only 198 mAh/g could be discharged, wherefore a theoretical capacity of 110 mAh/g remained in the particles. This incomplete discharge may be due to slow proton diffusion. In the subsequent cycles, then, this remaining charge in the bulk of the particles continuously diffused toward the surface, where it allowed for a higher discharge capacity than charge capacity.
 ###### 
from test: 14 λ-MnO2, which is a comparatively new material and was first synthesized by Hunter in 198116 has been studied relatively little for alkaline applications. We conducted preliminary tests with λ-MnO2 and found that λ-MnO2 has a slightly higher chemical charge rate than γ-MnO2, despite a lower surface area.17,18 As summarized in Table I, its capabilities in terms of cyclability and capacity are similar to γ-MnO2 and more promising than other structures. Thus, in this paper, we analyzed the possibility of using λ-MnO2 in a FCB system by comparing its performance in terms of ORR rate (fuel cell mode), redox cycling (battery mode), and chemical charging (FCB mode) with that of γ-MnO2.
from Soup: 14 The reason for the different performance of the two materials at high discharge rate may be their differing proton diffusivity. To verify this claim, the EIS measurement results were used to calculate the proton diffusion according to following formula: 22 where A is the electrochemically active surface area (m 2 ), D is the proton diffusion constant (m 2 /s), R is the standard gas constant (8.31 J/(mol K)), T is the absolute temperature (K), σ is the CPE2 pre-factor (Ω) identified via EIS, F is the Faraday constant (96 490 C), and C is the effective solid-state proton concentration (mol/m 3 ). The resulting proton diffusion of γ-MnO 2 and λ-MnO 2 was calculated to be 1.15 × 10 −11 m 3 s −1/2 g −1 and 6.72 × 10 −12 m 3 s −1/2 g −1 , respectively. Solid state diffusion was thus 1.7 times faster in γ-MnO 2 than in λ-MnO 2 , indicating that proton diffusion was the reason for the higher discharge capacity of γ-MnO 2 at high C-rate compared with that of λ-MnO 2 .
 ###### 
from test: 15 Both the γ-MnO2 and λ-MnO2 used in this work were based on commercially available materials. Electrolytic γ-MnO2 manganese dioxide (EMD, Tosoh Corp., Japan) was used as received. λ-MnO2 was obtained by chemical delithiation of LiMn2O4 (BET surface area: 0.4 m2/g, Mitsui Kinzoku, Japan) in a 0.1 M nitric acid solution for 24 h under stirring.16 This treatment removed the lithium ions from the crystal lattice of the LiMn2O4 without damaging its spinel structure. Slurries of the active materials were prepared by mixing carbon black (CB, 50 nm diameter, Mitsubishi Chemical, Japan) and MnO2 with ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA, Tosoh Corp.) in ca. 100°C xylene solution at a weight ratio of MnO2:CB:EVA = 100:15:10. The slurry was pasted onto a 500-μm-thick nickel foam, dried in air at room temperature for 24 h, and pressed at 40 MPa to obtain 2 cm × 4 cm-sized electrodes. The MnO2 loading of all samples was between 12 and 16 mg/cm2. Three-electrode cells were assembled with the active electrode, a nickel foam counter electrode, and an Hg/HgO reference electrode. A porous 120-μm-thick polypropylene sheet and a 6-M KOH solution were used as separator and electrolyte, respectively.
from Soup: 15 In the case of both γ-MnO 2 and λ-MnO 2 , the capacity decreased considerably during the first cycles. To identify the reason for the losses, XRD measurements were conducted after the first discharge and after cycling. Fig. 11 shows that all peaks belonging to the original γ-MnO 2 structure remained after the initial discharge and no transformation into another crystal structure occurred. Peak shifts toward higher d-values were observed, which may have been caused by Jahn–Teller distortion. During electrochemical charge/discharge cycles, however, a complete transformation into δ-MnO 2 was observed. Thus, the previous finding that δ-MnO 2 has a low capacity 13 was probably also caused by capacity fading resulting from phase transformation.
 ###### 
from test: 16 Figure 2 shows the experimental set-up used for chemical charging with oxygen and ORR tests. Oxygen was supplied via a tube (0.8-mm diameter) that was inserted close to the active electrode. The set-up enabled the oxygen to be supplied at an elevated pressure (1 MPa), which was previously found to accelerate the regeneration process.7 The oxygen was supplied at a flow rate of 10 mL/min in all cases.
from Soup: 16 In contrast, λ-MnO 2 was found to transform partially into δ-MnO 2 after the first discharge. The reduction in the capacity of the λ-MnO 2 during the first few electrochemical charge/discharge cycles was thus attributable to its crystal transformation into δ-MnO 2 . After 36 cycles, however, XRD patterns still revealed clear peaks belonging to λ-MnO 2 structure, suggesting a higher crystal stability of λ-MnO 2 .
 ###### 
from test: 17 In all experiments, a discharge cutoff voltage of –0.4 V vs. Hg/HgO was implemented.
from Soup: 17 Thus, for electrochemical cycling, it can be summarized that γ-MnO 2 showed better performance at high C-rate than λ-MnO 2 . This stemmed from the high surface area of γ-MnO 2 because proton diffusion (A√D) is directly proportional to surface area. 21 The stability of the γ-structure, however, was found to be poor, and resulted in its continuous transformation into layered δ-MnO 2 . This is non-desirable because δ-MnO 2 has been shown to have poor electrochemical stability. 13 In contrast, although the λ-MnO 2 sample showed poor performance at high C-rate, its crystal structure was more stable during the electrochemical cycling. Transformation into δ-MnO 2 appeared to mainly occur during the first few cycles.
 ###### 
from test: 18 The crystal structures of the MnO2 samples were analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD; Cu Kα radiation, XRD Miniflex, Rigaku Corp., Japan). The diffraction patterns were measured between θ/2θ = 10° and 80°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Tabletop Microscope TM3030, Hitachi-Hitec, Japan) was used to further characterize the morphology of the samples. The average specific surface area of the MnO2 samples was determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption method (Belsorp-max, BEL Japan). Electrochemical tests, namely cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge analysis, were conducted with a galvanostat/potentiostat (Analytical 1480 Multistat, Solartron) at 25°C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using a frequency response analyzer (1255B, Solartron). The frequency response was measured between 0.01 Hz and 100 kHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV and a scan rate of 10 points per decade.
from Soup: 18 To assess the chemical charging capability of γ-and λ-MnO 2 in FCB mode, the samples were first fully discharged electrochemically. This included an initial discharge at 0.1 C to the same cutoff voltage as that used during electrochemical cycling, followed by open circuit conditions for 12 h and a second discharge at 0.1 C. This limited the effect of residual MnO 2 on the measurements. After the electrodes were completely discharged, they were chemically charged by supplying oxygen directly into the electrolyte in a pressurized vessel at 1.0 MPa. After 1 h charging, the pressure in the container was reduced to atmospheric pressure, and the samples were discharged at 0.1 C under ambient conditions. The discharge curves of both electrodes are shown in Fig. 12a .
 ###### 
from test: 19 Figures 3a and 3b show the XRD patterns of γ- and λ-MnO2, respectively. All of the peaks of γ- and λ-MnO2 were found to be present without any impurity peaks. Furthermore, the intensity of the γ-MnO2 peaks was found to be well below the intensity of those of λ-MnO2, indicating a higher crystallinity for the latter.
from Soup: 19 As can be seen in Fig. 6 , for both types of electrode, the potential increased during chemical charging. The potential of the λ-MnO 2 electrode after 1 h chemical charging was 0.037 V vs. Hg/HgO, higher than that of the γ-MnO 2 electrode (−0.033 V vs. Hg/HgO). This indicated that the oxidation of λ-MnO 2 was faster than that of γ-MnO 2 , which was verified by the subsequent electrochemical discharge at 0.1 C. As shown in Fig. 12a , at a discharge cutoff voltage of −0.4 V vs. Hg/HgO, the regenerated capacities of the γ-MnO 2 and λ-MnO 2 samples were determined to be 33.7 mAh/g and 37.1 mAh/g, respectively. The electrodes were subsequently chemically charged with oxygen and electrochemically discharged for a total of 10 times according to the same procedure as in the first cycle in order to verify the possibility of MnO 2 to be chemically cycled in FCB mode. The cumulative charge capacity of both electrodes exceeded the theoretical capacity of 308 mAh/g which thus proofs that the electrodes were chemically charged with oxygen. It is likely that the cumulative charge would have been even higher if additional cycles had been carried out. The cumulative capacity of γ- and λ-MnO 2 after 10 cycles were 333.5 mAh/g and 399.6 mAh/g, respectively.
 ###### 
from test: 20 The SEM images of the γ-MnO2 and λ-MnO2 samples are shown in Figs. 4a and 4b, respectively. Both the γ-MnO2 and λ-MnO2 samples were observed to contain particles of up to several micrometers in diameter. The particles of γ-MnO2 had various shapes, whereas most of the λ-MnO2 particles were well-shaped octahedra. The measured BET surface area of the λ-MnO2 sample (14.5 m2/g) was lower than that of the γ-MnO2 sample (51.5 m2/g). This was caused by the smooth surface of the particles in the λ-MnO2 sample.
from Soup: 20 The XRD patterns of the electrodes after 10 FCB cycles are shown in Fig. 13 . For both types of electrode, the initial peaks of γ- and λ-MnO 2 were still present without any impurities. In case of γ-MnO 2 , amorphization likely occurred which decreased the intensity of the peaks, similar to ORR results. Similarly, also in λ-MnO 2 the intensity of the peaks decreased wherefore it is likely that during FCB mode, amorphization takes place, as in γ-MnO 2 . Interestingly, no δ-MnO 2 could be observed, which was found to be created during ORR and electrochemical cycling.
 ###### 
from test: 21 The CV curves of γ- and λ-MnO2 measured at a cycling rate of 0.1 mV/sec for 5 loops between −0.4 V and 0.5 V vs. Hg/HgO are shown in Fig. 5. Both the reduction and oxidation peaks of γ-MnO2 were observed to become weaker in intensity as the cycle number increased, indicating degradation of the γ-MnO2. Furthermore, in case of γ-MnO2, two oxidation and reduction peaks were observed which may be attributable to phase transformations between γ- and δ-MnO2.19 In contrast, the intensity of the peaks of λ-MnO2 remained comparatively stable, indicating a slow degradation of λ-MnO2. The intensity of the peaks was however weaker than those of γ-MnO2 which indicates better proton diffusion of the latter. It was found that toward 0.5 V vs. Hg/HgO, bubbles were created which was likely caused by oxygen evolution reaction. Thus, the charge cutoff potential for both γ- and λ-MnO2 in battery mode (electrochemical charge/discharge cycling) was set at 0.5 V vs. Hg/HgO.
from Soup: 21 In fuel cell mode, the ORR over λ-MnO 2 was found to be considerably faster than that over γ-MnO 2 , and in battery mode, γ-MnO 2 showed better performance than λ-MnO 2 . As mentioned previously, in fuel cell mode, the reaction takes only place at the surface, thus indicating a higher surface activity of λ-MnO 2 . In contrast, in battery mode, proton diffusion is crucial, which appeared to be faster in γ-MnO 2 . In FCB mode, it is unlikely that oxygen entered the MnO 2 lattice owing to its physical properties, and thus a two-step process is suggested for chemical charging. First, the surface is oxidized according to following reaction:
 ###### 
from test: 22 To evaluate the ORR in fuel cell mode, the samples were first fully discharged at 0.1 C to −0.4 V vs. Hg/HgO for γ-MnO2 and then exposed to oxygen flow for 5 h to re-oxidize their surface and achieve a stable voltage. These two steps were conducted to allow for a better comparison between fuel cell mode and FCB mode, as in FCB mode, the electrodes also had to be electrochemically discharged prior to chemical oxygen charge. Thereafter, a constant current was applied at different C-rates (from 0.01 C to 1 C) while oxygen was supplied. The resulting curves of γ- and λ-MnO2 are shown in Fig. 6. Because it was found that the potential did not immediately reach the final set potential but levelled off only after a few minutes, every current was applied for 1 h, which was found to be sufficient to achieve a constant potential. The reason for this slow stabilization was the intrinsic storage capacity of MnO2. At the beginning of each step, electrochemical discharge was likely to be dominant before ORR led to a constant potential.
from Soup: 22 Thereafter, the bulk is oxidized by proton diffusion to the surface:
 ###### 
from test: 23 The resulting I-V curves of the ORR experiments are shown in Fig. 7 where all the current rates which did not hit the cutoff voltage are shown. It was found that γ-MnO2 could be discharged at a current density of 7.0 mA/cm2 (equivalent to 0.2 C) without hitting the cutoff potential. At 7.0 mA/cm2, a potential of −0.182 V vs. Hg/HgO was measured. When the current was increased to 17.5 mA/cm2 (0.5 C), the cutoff potential of −0.4 V vs. Hg/HgO was reached after 11 min. In contrast, λ-MnO2 exhibited a higher oxygen reduction rate. Even at 17.5 mA/cm2 (0.5 C), a steady potential of −0.101 V vs. Hg/HgO was observed in spite of the considerably smaller surface area of the material. At 35.0 mA/cm2 (1 C), the cutoff potential was reached after 24 min.
from Soup: 23 Thus, it is suggested that both the surface activity and proton diffusion are crucial for quick chemical charging. Owing to its smaller charge transfer resistance, it is suggested that surface oxidation was faster in λ-MnO 2 than in γ-MnO 2 . However, owing to the slow proton diffusion of λ-MnO 2 , bulk oxidation occurred slowly, thus inhibiting quick chemical charging. However, proton diffusion was considerably faster in γ-MnO 2 compared with in λ-MnO 2 , as evidenced by the present EIS analysis. It is thus suggested that the rate limiting step of the chemical charging of γ-MnO 2 was surface oxidation. Thus, after 1 h of oxygen charging, the charged capacity of the two samples was similar. For the moment, however, these conclusions are somewhat speculative and additional work is necessary to better understand the chemical charge mechanism. In upcoming work currently in progress, the chemical charge model will be refined and the rate limiting steps will be identified.
 ###### 
from test: 24 In a previous study by Lima et al.,20 it was proposed that the electron transfer from MnO2 to the adsorbed oxygen is the rate limiting step during ORR. This means that the charge transfer resistance is a crucial factor during ORR. To quantify the charge transfer resistance of the materials, EIS measurements were conducted on the electrodes after their complete discharge. Figure 8 shows the EIS measurement results for fully discharged γ- and λ-MnO2. For simulation purposes, an equivalent circuit model consisting of an uncompensated solution resistance (Rsol), a charge transfer resistance (Rct), and two constant phase elements (CPE) was used according based on the work of Bailey et al.21 Rsol and Rct are the solution resistance from the reference electrode to the MnO2 electrode current collector and the resistance of charge transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface, respectively. The results of the simulation showed that λ-MnO2 had a considerably lower charge transfer resistance (1.31 Ω) than γ-MnO2 (7.03 Ω), thus verifying that the faster ORR rate of λ-MnO2 arose from its lower charge transfer resistance.
from Soup: 24 We have evaluated the possibility of replacing γ-MnO 2 , which is typically found in FCB systems, with λ-MnO 2 . The ORR, electrochemical cyclability, and chemical charging of both materials were measured, and their structural stability was analyzed by XRD to verify their applicability to FCB systems. λ-MnO 2 was found to be a promising material owing to its higher crystal stability in all modes than that of γ-MnO 2 and high ORR rate despite its low surface area. Moreover, chemical charging was found to proceed somewhat more quickly in λ-MnO 2 . Only during electrochemical cycling did γ-MnO 2 show a better performance than λ-MnO 2 , which was likely caused by its higher proton diffusion arising from its larger surface area. In future work, the chemical charging mechanism of MnO 2 will have to be further analyzed to better understand what the rate limiting steps are and how faster chemical charge rates can be obtained.
 ###### 
from test: 25 After ORR analysis, the crystal structure of the samples was analyzed by XRD to evaluate the crystal durability of each material. As shown in Fig. 9a, after ORR with γ-MnO2, the original peaks of γ-MnO2 were still observable without any impurity peaks. The decreased intensity can be assigned to the binder that likely covered the MnO2 particles and amorphization of the electroactive material.2 In contrast, in the case of λ-MnO2, formation of δ-MnO2 was observed, but the original peaks assignable to the λ-structure are fairly intense wherefore it is likely that amorphization occurred to a lesser extent than in γ-MnO2.
from Soup: 25 A novel electrochemical system with a of power generation and energy storage dual function, referred to as a fuel cell/battery (FCB) system, was proposed in our previous work. 1 – 3 The FCB system consists of a metal hydride (MH) negative electrode and a manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) positive electrode in an alkaline electrolyte. In the negative electrode of the FCB system, the metal hydride can be electrochemically charged as shown in the following reaction:
 ###### 
from test: 26 The electrochemical redox cycling performance of γ- and λ-MnO2 was investigated under battery mode at charge/discharge rates of 0.1C/0.1C, 0.2C/0.2C, 0.2C/0.5C, 0.2C/1.0C, 0.2C/2.0C, and 0.2C/5.0C. The charge and discharge capacities of both γ-MnO2 and λ-MnO2 during 36 cycles at different charge and discharge rates are shown in Fig. 10. The capacity of both electrodes decreased during the first cycles at 0.1 C/0.1 C. The subsequent cycles showed reasonably good capacity retention at the same charge/discharge rate, but the capacity decreased as the discharge rate was increased. A more significant capacity reduction was observed in the case of λ-MnO2. During charge/discharge cycling at 0.2C/0.5C, the discharge capacity of λ-MnO2 was only half that observed for γ-MnO2, whereas at during subsequent 0.1C/0.1C charge/discharge cycles, the capacities of both samples were similar and recovered to 66.3% (λ-MnO2) and 70.7% (γ-MnO2).
from Soup: 26 Additionally, the metal hydride can be rapidly charged with hydrogen gas as follows: 4
 ###### 
from test: 27 It also has to be noted that during the first cycles, the charged capacity was lower than the discharged capacity, particularly in case of λ-MnO2. This resulted in an apparent Coulombic efficiency of above 100%. The reason for this observation is suggested to be due to incomplete discharge during the first cycle. During the first discharge, only 198 mAh/g could be discharged, wherefore a theoretical capacity of 110 mAh/g remained in the particles. This incomplete discharge may be due to slow proton diffusion. In the subsequent cycles, then, this remaining charge in the bulk of the particles continuously diffused toward the surface, where it allowed for a higher discharge capacity than charge capacity.
from Soup: 27 The charged MH can then be discharged electrochemically. This reaction is equivalent to the reverse of reaction. 1 MH can thus work as a negative electrode in a FCB system because it can function as a negative electrode in (a) fuel cell mode, in which it works as a hydrogen oxidation catalyst, (b) battery mode, in which it is electrochemically redox cycled, and (c) FCB mode, in which the metal hydride is chemically charged with hydrogen ( Eq. 2 ) and then electrochemically discharged according to a battery electrode. 4
 ###### 
from test: 28 The reason for the different performance of the two materials at high discharge rate may be their differing proton diffusivity. To verify this claim, the EIS measurement results were used to calculate the proton diffusion according to following formula:22 where A is the electrochemically active surface area (m2), D is the proton diffusion constant (m2/s), R is the standard gas constant (8.31 J/(mol K)), T is the absolute temperature (K), σ is the CPE2 pre-factor (Ω) identified via EIS, F is the Faraday constant (96 490 C), and C is the effective solid-state proton concentration (mol/m3). The resulting proton diffusion of γ-MnO2 and λ-MnO2 was calculated to be 1.15 × 10−11 m3 s−1/2 g−1 and 6.72 × 10−12 m3 s−1/2 g−1, respectively. Solid state diffusion was thus 1.7 times faster in γ-MnO2 than in λ-MnO2, indicating that proton diffusion was the reason for the higher discharge capacity of γ-MnO2 at high C-rate compared with that of λ-MnO2.
from Soup: 28 In the positive electrode of the FCB system, MnO 2 has been found to be a promising material to enable the three aforementioned operating modes. 2 The main reactions of the three operating modes occurring at the positive electrode of the FCB system are summarized in Fig. 1.
 ###### 
from test: 29 In the case of both γ-MnO2 and λ-MnO2, the capacity decreased considerably during the first cycles. To identify the reason for the losses, XRD measurements were conducted after the first discharge and after cycling. Fig. 11 shows that all peaks belonging to the original γ-MnO2 structure remained after the initial discharge and no transformation into another crystal structure occurred. Peak shifts toward higher d-values were observed, which may have been caused by Jahn–Teller distortion. During electrochemical charge/discharge cycles, however, a complete transformation into δ-MnO2 was observed. Thus, the previous finding that δ-MnO2 has a low capacity13 was probably also caused by capacity fading resulting from phase transformation.
from Soup: 29 (a) Fuel cell mode: In fuel cell mode, the MnO 2 positive electrode functions as a catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Thus, the surface activity is crucial in this mode. It has been described previously that the two overall pathways of ORR that take place in alkaline electrolyte are as follows: 5
 ###### 
from test: 30 In contrast, λ-MnO2 was found to transform partially into δ-MnO2 after the first discharge. The reduction in the capacity of the λ-MnO2 during the first few electrochemical charge/discharge cycles was thus attributable to its crystal transformation into δ-MnO2. After 36 cycles, however, XRD patterns still revealed clear peaks belonging to λ-MnO2 structure, suggesting a higher crystal stability of λ-MnO2.
from Soup: 30 Direct 4-electron pathway:
 ###### 
from test: 31 Thus, for electrochemical cycling, it can be summarized that γ-MnO2 showed better performance at high C-rate than λ-MnO2. This stemmed from the high surface area of γ-MnO2 because proton diffusion (A√D) is directly proportional to surface area.21 The stability of the γ-structure, however, was found to be poor, and resulted in its continuous transformation into layered δ-MnO2. This is non-desirable because δ-MnO2 has been shown to have poor electrochemical stability.13 In contrast, although the λ-MnO2 sample showed poor performance at high C-rate, its crystal structure was more stable during the electrochemical cycling. Transformation into δ-MnO2 appeared to mainly occur during the first few cycles.
from Soup: 31 (2 + 2)-electron pathway (peroxide pathway): This reaction is then either followed by a further reduction reaction: or the decomposition reaction:
 ###### 
from test: 32 To assess the chemical charging capability of γ-and λ-MnO2 in FCB mode, the samples were first fully discharged electrochemically. This included an initial discharge at 0.1 C to the same cutoff voltage as that used during electrochemical cycling, followed by open circuit conditions for 12 h and a second discharge at 0.1 C. This limited the effect of residual MnO2 on the measurements. After the electrodes were completely discharged, they were chemically charged by supplying oxygen directly into the electrolyte in a pressurized vessel at 1.0 MPa. After 1 h charging, the pressure in the container was reduced to atmospheric pressure, and the samples were discharged at 0.1 C under ambient conditions. The discharge curves of both electrodes are shown in Fig. 12a.
from Soup: 32 (b) Battery mode: In battery mode, MnO 2 serves as the active material. MnO 2 in the positive electrode can be electrochemically reduced to MnOOH (discharge) and re-oxidized to MnO 2 (charge) as follows: 3 , 6
 ###### 
from test: 33 As can be seen in Fig. 6, for both types of electrode, the potential increased during chemical charging. The potential of the λ-MnO2 electrode after 1 h chemical charging was 0.037 V vs. Hg/HgO, higher than that of the γ-MnO2 electrode (−0.033 V vs. Hg/HgO). This indicated that the oxidation of λ-MnO2 was faster than that of γ-MnO2, which was verified by the subsequent electrochemical discharge at 0.1 C. As shown in Fig. 12a, at a discharge cutoff voltage of −0.4 V vs. Hg/HgO, the regenerated capacities of the γ-MnO2 and λ-MnO2 samples were determined to be 33.7 mAh/g and 37.1 mAh/g, respectively. The electrodes were subsequently chemically charged with oxygen and electrochemically discharged for a total of 10 times according to the same procedure as in the first cycle in order to verify the possibility of MnO2 to be chemically cycled in FCB mode. The cumulative charge capacity of both electrodes exceeded the theoretical capacity of 308 mAh/g which thus proofs that the electrodes were chemically charged with oxygen. It is likely that the cumulative charge would have been even higher if additional cycles had been carried out. The cumulative capacity of γ- and λ-MnO2 after 10 cycles were 333.5 mAh/g and 399.6 mAh/g, respectively.
from Soup: 33 In contrast to fuel cell mode, fast proton diffusion is crucial in battery mode to enable rapid electrochemical redox cycling.
 ###### 
from test: 34 The XRD patterns of the electrodes after 10 FCB cycles are shown in Fig. 13. For both types of electrode, the initial peaks of γ- and λ-MnO2 were still present without any impurities. In case of γ-MnO2, amorphization likely occurred which decreased the intensity of the peaks, similar to ORR results. Similarly, also in λ-MnO2 the intensity of the peaks decreased wherefore it is likely that during FCB mode, amorphization takes place, as in γ-MnO2. Interestingly, no δ-MnO2 could be observed, which was found to be created during ORR and electrochemical cycling.
from Soup: 34 (c) Fuel cell/battery mode: In the positive electrode of FCB systems, it has been described that MnOOH, which is formed by discharge of MnO 2 , can be chemically recharged by oxygen (regeneration with oxygen) as follows: 2 , 7 , 8
 ###### 
from test: 35 In fuel cell mode, the ORR over λ-MnO2 was found to be considerably faster than that over γ-MnO2, and in battery mode, γ-MnO2 showed better performance than λ-MnO2. As mentioned previously, in fuel cell mode, the reaction takes only place at the surface, thus indicating a higher surface activity of λ-MnO2. In contrast, in battery mode, proton diffusion is crucial, which appeared to be faster in γ-MnO2. In FCB mode, it is unlikely that oxygen entered the MnO2 lattice owing to its physical properties, and thus a two-step process is suggested for chemical charging. First, the surface is oxidized according to following reaction:
from Soup: 35 After this regeneration, the MnO 2 can then be electrochemically discharged according to reaction 7 .
 ###### 
from test: 36 Thereafter, the bulk is oxidized by proton diffusion to the surface:
from Soup: 36 Several different MnO 2 crystal structures exist, such as 1D tunnel structures (α-, β-, and γ-MnO 2 ), a layered structure (δ-MnO 2 ), and a 3D tunnel structure (λ-MnO 2 ). Research for ORR in alkaline fuel cells has primarily focused on 1D and layered structures. 9 – 12 It was reported that α- and δ-MnO 2 exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity than other MnO 2 crystal structures, such as β-MnO 2 . However, in battery mode, we found that both α- and δ-MnO 2 show poor redox reaction cyclability because of the formation of Mn 3 O 4 . 13 Furthermore, δ-MnO 2 is known to show poor structural stability during electrochemical cycling due to expansion and shrinkage of the crystal. 14 As an alternative, our group has used γ-MnO 2 for the application in FCB systems because this crystal structure was found to have a good redox reaction cyclability if the discharge was cutoff at a potential of −0.4 V vs. Hg/HgO. 2 , 7 , 15 Only when a low discharge potential of −0.9 V vs. Hg/HgO was set, inactive Mn 3 O 4 was formed, leading to poor redox reaction cyclability. 2 However, the reaction rate of chemical charging ( Eq. 8 ) was observed to be very slow. The chemical charging of a γ-MnO 2 positive electrode with oxygen for 1 h only oxidized ca. 13% of the MnOOH. 2
 ###### 
from test: 37 Thus, it is suggested that both the surface activity and proton diffusion are crucial for quick chemical charging. Owing to its smaller charge transfer resistance, it is suggested that surface oxidation was faster in λ-MnO2 than in γ-MnO2. However, owing to the slow proton diffusion of λ-MnO2, bulk oxidation occurred slowly, thus inhibiting quick chemical charging. However, proton diffusion was considerably faster in γ-MnO2 compared with in λ-MnO2, as evidenced by the present EIS analysis. It is thus suggested that the rate limiting step of the chemical charging of γ-MnO2 was surface oxidation. Thus, after 1 h of oxygen charging, the charged capacity of the two samples was similar. For the moment, however, these conclusions are somewhat speculative and additional work is necessary to better understand the chemical charge mechanism. In upcoming work currently in progress, the chemical charge model will be refined and the rate limiting steps will be identified.
from Soup: 37 λ-MnO 2 , which is a comparatively new material and was first synthesized by Hunter in 1981 16 has been studied relatively little for alkaline applications. We conducted preliminary tests with λ-MnO 2 and found that λ-MnO 2 has a slightly higher chemical charge rate than γ-MnO 2 , despite a lower surface area. 17 , 18 As summarized in Table I , its capabilities in terms of cyclability and capacity are similar to γ-MnO 2 and more promising than other structures. Thus, in this paper, we analyzed the possibility of using λ-MnO 2 in a FCB system by comparing its performance in terms of ORR rate (fuel cell mode), redox cycling (battery mode), and chemical charging (FCB mode) with that of γ-MnO 2 .
 ###### 
from test: 38 We have evaluated the possibility of replacing γ-MnO2, which is typically found in FCB systems, with λ-MnO2. The ORR, electrochemical cyclability, and chemical charging of both materials were measured, and their structural stability was analyzed by XRD to verify their applicability to FCB systems. λ-MnO2 was found to be a promising material owing to its higher crystal stability in all modes than that of γ-MnO2 and high ORR rate despite its low surface area. Moreover, chemical charging was found to proceed somewhat more quickly in λ-MnO2. Only during electrochemical cycling did γ-MnO2 show a better performance than λ-MnO2, which was likely caused by its higher proton diffusion arising from its larger surface area. In future work, the chemical charging mechanism of MnO2 will have to be further analyzed to better understand what the rate limiting steps are and how faster chemical charge rates can be obtained.
