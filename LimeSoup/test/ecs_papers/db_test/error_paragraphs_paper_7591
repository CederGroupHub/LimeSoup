from test: 0 A channel-flow double-electrode system has been employed to determine the potential regions of Pt dissolution and redeposition during a cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at 25°C . The double-electrode system consists of a Pt plate as a working electrode (WE) placed upstream and a Au plate as a collector electrode (CE) placed downstream with a separation gap of 0.1 mm. Pt ions dissolved at the WE during CV have been detected at the CE by employing an appropriate reduction potential and have been analyzed by using an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA). The EPMA results show that the deposition of Pt from hydrated Pt ions occurs below 0.60 V vs the standard hydrogen electrode. When CV is carried out between 0.0 and 1.4 or 1.6 V, dissolution of Pt occurs during both the anodic and cathodic scans of the CV. When CV is carried out between 0.0 V and an upper potential limit of 1.2 V, the dissolution of Pt could be observed only in the anodic scan. The dissolution mechanism of Pt during CV is proposed.

from test: 1 Figure 1 shows the schematic of the CFDE system (CF-FCYT-1000, Eiwa, Japan), which consists of three main components, namely, the control unit, the double-electrode assembly, and a reservoir tank. The double-electrode assembly consisted of a Pt-coated Au plate (1×4mm) as the working electrode (WE) and an Au plate (1×4mm) as the collector electrode (CE) embedded in an acrylic block (155×40×15mm) in parallel with a gap of 0.1 mm. The electrode assembly was polished with SiC papers until no. 2000 followed by mirror finishes using 3 and 0.25μm diamond paste spray on appropriate polishing cloths. The polishing was done in the longitudinal direction with respect to the electrodes. After polishing, the electrodes were cleaned by ultrasonicating in an ethanol and distilled water mixture solution (1:1) for 15 min. The electrodeposition of Pt on a Au surface was carried out in 2% H2PtCl6 solution at 0.20 V vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) for 10 min. During the electrodeposition process, the Au CE was covered so as to prevent contamination by Pt. A 0.5 mm high channel was constructed on these electrodes by covering with another acrylic block, as shown in Fig. 2.
from Soup: 1 The surface state of Pt is a very important factor that influences its electrocatalytic behaviors. 1 – 3 In a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), Pt at the cathode is exposed at a higher potential where oxidation of Pt occurs. There have been extensive researches on the dissolution and oxidation behaviors of Pt using a potential cycling experiment. 4 – 7 All the studies have found an accelerating effect of the potential cycle on the dissolution of Pt. However, it is not yet clear under what condition of potential cycle the dissolution of Pt takes place. Johnson et al. 8 reported the formation of Pt(II) during both the oxidation and the reduction of a Pt electrode in 1 M H2SO4 using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE). Due to the residual current at the ring electrode and the presence of a trace amount of oxygen, even a sufficiently deaerated solution makes it difficult to assign the ring current to the reaction involving a redox reaction of Pt. The current at the ring electrode can be affected by the oxygen reduction reaction at the disk electrode as well. Besides this, the amount of Pt dissolved is very low, which makes it difficult to separate the redox current for Pt from the residual current.
 ###### 
from test: 2 A multichannel potentiostat (PS-08, TOHO Technical Research, Japan) was used for the measurement of the current-potential response. A saturated silver–silver chloride with double junction was used as the reference electrode, and a Pt gauze was used as the counter electrode. The counter and reference electrodes were used for both WE and CE, and WE was made as a ground to avoid an interaction between the two circuits. All the potential values were indicated with respect to the SHE. The CV of the Pt WE was performed in 0.5 M H2SO4 at the scan rate of 100 mV/s and in the presence of Ar gas. The CVs were run for either 500 or 2000 cycles. While running CV of the Pt WE, the potential at the Au CE was controlled by using a potential step setup, which allowed us to set one potential during the anodic scan and another one during the cathodic scan or to set a different potential during a single scan of the CV. This was necessary as it allowed us to determine if a certain process took place during the anodic or the cathodic scan of the CV.
from Soup: 2 The report by Johnson et al. 8 that Pt(II) was detected during the reduction in the oxidized Pt electrode implied that the oxidation of Pt leads to the formation of PtO2 . There is a debate regarding the type of Pt oxide formed during anodic polarization in acidic solution. The opinions are divided between the one that favors the formation of PtO and others who favor the formation of PtO2 . Vetter and Schultze, 9 Weaver, 10 and Damjanovic et al. 11 argued that an increase in potential in the positive direction could only lead to the change in the thickness of the oxide layers without any changes in its composition. Some authors considered that potential change could lead to changes in the nature 12 – 16 or structure 3 , 17 of the oxide layer.

from test: 3 The test solution from a reservoir was flown on these electrodes through the channel at a rate of 10 cm/s with a chemical pump (control unit), where a laminar flow was established.31–36 Pt ions dissolved into the flowing solution from the Pt WE (upstream electrode) during the potential cycle were electrochemically detected at the Au CE (downstream electrode), the electrode potential of which was varied from 0.30 to 0.80 V.
from Soup: 3 The formation of PtO was proposed by Ord and Ho 18 on the basis of optical measurements. It has been considered that the formation of PtO via the intermediate of PtOH takes place by a two-stage mechanism. 3 , 19 – 21 However, Kim et al. 15 identified the presence of PtO2 . Allen et al. , 22 using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of oxygen adsorbed by Pt, proposed that the initially formed reversible form, PtOH, changed into Pt(OH)2 but not into PtO. Allen et al. 22 also suggested that the formation of PtO was observed only at a very anodic potential, ca. 2.4 V. Conway and co-workers 1 , 3 , 17 , 23 , 24 did extensive work on Pt oxidation and proposed that in acid solutions at potentials up to 0.85 V the formation of PtOH took place, at higher potentials a reorganized HOPt layer was formed, and at potentials starting from 1.1 V an oxide began to form due to the oxidation of PtOH and HOPt to PtO. Harrington 25 proposed a two-electron mechanism of the Pt surface oxidation based on the results of the simulation of ac voltammetry of Pt. Biegler et al. 12 and Tyurin et al. 13 , 26 , 27 supposed that at a potential up to 2.0 V PtO changed into PtO2 . Mitsushima et al. 28 reported the formation of PtO2 during a symmetric potential cycle. Recently, Jerkiewicz et al. , 29 with the help of electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance and Auger electron spectroscopy measurements, confirmed the formation of PtO in the potential range of 1.2–1.4 V. It has been mentioned that at a potential higher than 1.5 V, PtO2 is formed by further oxidation of the already existing PtO layers, resulting in a two-layer system. 30 It is clear from the above discussion that there is still no agreement regarding the surface state of Pt.

from test: 4 In this work, three sets of measurements were made: In the first set, a potential value that could be used to deposit Pt at the Au CE was determined; in the second set, the critical potential at which a reduction in hydrated Pt ions could take place on the Au CE during CV of the Pt WE was determined; and finally in the third set, experiments were designed to know if the cathodic dissolution of Pt took place or not by detecting Pt at the Au CE during the cathodic scan of the CV.
from Soup: 4 In this study, a channel-flow double-electrode (CFDE) system, in combination with an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA), was used to clarify the surface state of Pt during a potential cycle. The CFDE is a hydrodynamic method in electrochemistry, which gives us the same information as an RRDE. However, the CFDE has the following advantages: ( i ) it has a low noise level because the CFDE, unlike RRDE, has no brush friction for the electric contact; ( ii ) polarization can be done without contamination of the electrolyte because fresh solution is always supplied to the electrodes; ( iii ) the electrodes can be more easily constructed; and ( iv ) it is applicable at higher temperatures. 31 Authors previously employed the CFDE to study anodic dissolution and passivation of metals such as iron, 32 , 33 cobalt, 34 chromium, 35 and copper, 36 where quantitative analyses of dissolved metal ions were done. In this study, however, a semiqualitative analysis was done by using CFDE in combination with EPMA because the amount of Pt dissolution was too small to be quantitatively analyzed. The aims of this study were to determine ( i ) whether cathodic dissolution of Pt takes place or not, ( ii ) the potential regions in which the formation of PtO and PtO2 takes place, and ( iii ) the reduction potential of hydrated Pt ion. Based on the above results, a mechanism for the dissolution of Pt during cyclic voltammetry (CV) is proposed.
 ###### 
from test: 5 In this study, Pt ions dissolved from the Pt WE were detected at the Au CE by electrochemically reducing them to metallic Pt. The deposition of Pt was confirmed by analyzing the Au CE surface with EPMA (JXA 8200, JEOL) using LiF crystal, which detected Lα1 lines of Pt. In all cases, EPMA mapping and a semiquantitative analysis were carried out. All EPMA mappings were done at beam currents of about (4.0–4.5)×10−7A to enhance the count. However, because the amount of deposited Pt was very small and the fact that Au and Pt had close L lines on LiF crystal, the background was higher. For this reason, the mapping images always showed various colors, indicating the presence of Pt, which could be misleading. Therefore, a semiquantitative point analysis was done at some places of the mapped surface. The diameter of the electron beam used for the point analysis was 30μm . Figure 3 shows the Lα1 lines of Au and Pt on LiF crystal, which were observed from a Pt-deposited Au CE. Au showed a very strong peak at the L value of 88.86 mm and a weak peak at 89.99 mm. But very weak peaks of Pt were observed at the L values of 90.94 and 91.48 mm. From Fig. 3, to avoid the detection of Au by LiF, all the mapping measurements were done at the L values of 90.52–91.82 mm, but even these were not enough to eliminate the large background in mapping results due to a very low amount of Pt such that the electron beam penetrated into the Au surface. However, a semiquantitative analysis, which subtracted the background signal from the integration of the peak signal, gave reliable results, and therefore it was used for every mapped surface to confirm both the deposition and the amount of Pt. From the peaks in Fig. 3, the amount of Au was estimated to be about 99.47% and that of Pt was about 0.53%.

A 0.5 mm high channel was constructed on these electrodes by covering with another acrylic block, as shown in Fig. 2 .

from test: 6 Figure 4 shows the CV of a Pt WE in 0.5 M H2SO4 at a flow rate of 10 cm/s; the scan rate was 100 mV/s. The CVs were recorded in between a low potential limit of 0.0 V to upper potential limits of 1.0, 1.4, and 1.6 V. In the positive scan of the potential, the anodic current due to the formation of Pt oxides started to increase around 0.75 V and the cathodic current owing to the reduction of Pt oxides was observed from about 1.0 V. Below 0.35 V, cathodic and anodic peaks related to the adsorption/desorption of hydrogen appeared. This is a typical CV of Pt in acidic solution.5, 29

from test: 7 Figure 5 shows the EPMA mapping image of a Au CE after 500 cycles of CV of a Pt WE between 0.0 and 1.4 V. The Au CE was set at the potential of 0.30 V during both anodic and cathodic scans of the CV. This mapping on the Au CE was made in an area of 100μm width from the nearest edge to the Pt WE (upstream side). The EPMA analysis of the Au CE in the farthest edge area (downstream side) showed the presence of only about 0.09% Pt compared to 0.53% near the edge, showing that the amount of deposited Pt decreases along the width of the Au CE. Thus, in all cases, EPMA analyses were carefully performed only at the nearest edge area to know if Pt was deposited during CV.
from Soup: 7 The test solution from a reservoir was flown on these electrodes through the channel at a rate of 10 cm/s with a chemical pump (control unit), where a laminar flow was established. 31 – 36 Pt ions dissolved into the flowing solution from the Pt WE (upstream electrode) during the potential cycle were electrochemically detected at the Au CE (downstream electrode), the electrode potential of which was varied from 0.30 to 0.80 V.
 ###### 
from test: 8 There is no literature available regarding the reduction potential of the hydrated Pt ions though many studies report on the reduction of Pt–chloride complex ions.5, 6 Therefore, in this setup, the potentials at the Au CE were set at 0.80, 0.70, 0.60, and 0.30 V during both anodic and cathodic scans of the CV of the Pt WE between 0.0 and 1.4 V. As the amount of the hydrated Pt ion was expected to be very low, all the CVs were made for 2000 cycles at the scan rate of 100 mV/s. In Table I, the results of EPMA analysis are summarized. It can be seen that no Pt was detected when the potential of Au CE was set at 0.70 V. About 0.15% Pt was detected when it was set at 0.60 V. This result shows that hydrated Pt ions produced during the CV of the Pt WE can be reduced to metallic Pt at about 0.60 V. In other experiments, two different potentials of 0.30 and 0.80 V were used as potentials of the Au CE, which are the Pt deposition and nondeposition potentials, respectively. From the collection number (0.30) of the employed CFDE system, which can be hydrodynamically calculated from the dimensions of channel depth and widths of the WE and CE and the gap,31 30% Pt ions dissolved at the Pt WE should be theoretically deposited on the surface of the Au CE when the potential of the Au CE is set at 0.30 V. No deposition of Pt occurred on the Au CE surface if the potential was set at 0.80 V even though Pt dissolves at the Pt WE.
from Soup: 8 In this work, three sets of measurements were made: In the first set, a potential value that could be used to deposit Pt at the Au CE was determined; in the second set, the critical potential at which a reduction in hydrated Pt ions could take place on the Au CE during CV of the Pt WE was determined; and finally in the third set, experiments were designed to know if the cathodic dissolution of Pt took place or not by detecting Pt at the Au CE during the cathodic scan of the CV.
 ###### 
from test: 9 To find the potential at which Pt can be deposited on Au CE, three different combinations of potentials were set at the Au CE while running CVs of the Pt WE. In the first case, the potential of the Au CE was set at 0.30 V during both anodic and cathodic scans of the CV. In the second case, the potential of the Au CE was set at 0.30 V during the anodic scan and at 0.80 V during the cathodic scan. In the third case, during the anodic scan the potential of the Au CE was set at 0.80 V and during the cathodic scan it was set at 0.30 V. In all cases, 500 cycles of CV were conducted at the Pt WE, and at the end of the measurement the Au CE surface was analyzed by EPMA for Pt. The EPMA results of the Au CE after CV between 0.0 and 1.4 V are summarized in Table II. The semiquantitative analysis showed the presence of about 0.53% Pt at Au CE when the potential of the Au CE was 0.30 V during both anodic and cathodic scans of the CV, and 0.30% Pt when the potential of the Au CE was 0.30 V during the anodic scan and 0.80 V during the cathodic scan of the CV. This result implies that Pt can be detected when the potential of Au CE is set at 0.30 V during the anodic scan of Pt. When the potential of the Au CE was set at 0.30 V during the cathodic scan and at 0.80 V during the anodic scan of the CV, the amount of Pt detected on the Au CE was very small (about 0.07%). The difference in the amount of Pt in the above three experiments shows that most of the Pt was deposited during the anodic scan of the CV.
from Soup: 9 In this study, Pt ions dissolved from the Pt WE were detected at the Au CE by electrochemically reducing them to metallic Pt.

 ###### 
from test: 10 It is obvious from the above results that Pt is dissolved in the anodic scan of the CV, so we made a further study on the cathodic dissolution. The potential of the Au CE should be set up in a way that Pt can be deposited only during the cathodic scan of the CV. For this purpose, the potential of the Au CE was set at 0.80 V during the anodic scan and at 0.30 V during the cathodic scan while performing 2000 cycles of CV of the Pt WE from 0.0 V until the upper limits (Eupper) of 1.6, 1.4, 1.2, and 1.0 V. As in other cases, at the end of CVs the Au CE was analyzed by EPMA for Pt.
from Soup: 10 Figure 4 shows the CV of a Pt WE in 0.5 M H2SO4 at a flow rate of 10 cm/s; the scan rate was 100 mV/s. The CVs were recorded in between a low potential limit of 0.0 V to upper potential limits of 1.0, 1.4, and 1.6 V. In the positive scan of the potential, the anodic current due to the formation of Pt oxides started to increase around 0.75 V and the cathodic current owing to the reduction of Pt oxides was observed from about 1.0 V. Below 0.35 V, cathodic and anodic peaks related to the adsorption/desorption of hydrogen appeared. This is a typical CV of Pt in acidic solution. 5 , 29
 ###### 
from test: 11 The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and EPMA mapping results at Eupper=1.6V are shown in Fig. 6, and all other results of the semiquantitative EPMA analysis are summarized in Table III. The EPMA results showed that the Pt was deposited at the Au CE only if Eupper=1.6 and 1.4 V at the Pt WE, while no Pt was detected when Eupper was 1.2 and 1.0 V. It can be seen in Fig. 6 that Pt was deposited in large amounts at the Au CE, where a clear gradient in the amount of Pt could be observed along the width. Near the interface with the Pt WE, a semiquantitative point analysis in 30μm diameter showed the presence of about 2.1% Pt compared to only 0.50% on the opposite side. No Pt was detected when Eupper was 1.2 and 1.0 V. From this result, the following two conclusions are made: first, the cathodic dissolution of Pt does take place,8 and second, the type of Pt oxide formed should be different above and below 1.4 V. The detailed mechanism is discussed in a later section.
from Soup: 11 Figure 5 shows the EPMA mapping image of a Au CE after 500 cycles of CV of a Pt WE between 0.0 and 1.4 V. The Au CE was set at the potential of 0.30 V during both anodic and cathodic scans of the CV. This mapping on the Au CE was made in an area of 100μm width from the nearest edge to the Pt WE (upstream side). The EPMA analysis of the Au CE in the farthest edge area (downstream side) showed the presence of only about 0.09% Pt compared to 0.53% near the edge, showing that the amount of deposited Pt decreases along the width of the Au CE. Thus, in all cases, EPMA analyses were carefully performed only at the nearest edge area to know if Pt was deposited during CV.
 ###### 
from test: 12 To determine the potential at which the dissolution of Pt starts, the potential of the Au CE was set at 0.30 V during the anodic scan and at 0.80 V during the cathodic scan while performing 2000 cycles of CV of the Pt WE from 0.0 V until Eupper=0.80 , 0.70, and 0.60 V. After 2000 cycles of CVs, the Au CE surface was analyzed by EPMA. These results are summarized in Table IV. From the fact that the deposited Pt was detected on the Au CE above 0.70 V and was not detected at 0.60 V, it is assumed that within the sensitivity limit of this technique, the dissolution potential of Pt lies between 0.60 and 0.70 V in the positive potential scan. Because the dissolution of Pt takes place at 0.80 V, the sensitivity of the measurement when the Au CE was set at 0.80 V must be lower compared to the one at 0.30 V.
from Soup: 12 There is no literature available regarding the reduction potential of the hydrated Pt ions though many studies report on the reduction of Pt–chloride complex ions. 5 , 6 Therefore, in this setup, the potentials at the Au CE were set at 0.80, 0.70, 0.60, and 0.30 V during both anodic and cathodic scans of the CV of the Pt WE between 0.0 and 1.4 V. As the amount of the hydrated Pt ion was expected to be very low, all the CVs were made for 2000 cycles at the scan rate of 100 mV/s. In Table I , the results of EPMA analysis are summarized. It can be seen that no Pt was detected when the potential of Au CE was set at 0.70 V. About 0.15% Pt was detected when it was set at 0.60 V. This result shows that hydrated Pt ions produced during the CV of the Pt WE can be reduced to metallic Pt at about 0.60 V. In other experiments, two different potentials of 0.30 and 0.80 V were used as potentials of the Au CE, which are the Pt deposition and nondeposition potentials, respectively. From the collection number (0.30) of the employed CFDE system, which can be hydrodynamically calculated from the dimensions of channel depth and widths of the WE and CE and the gap, 31 30% Pt ions dissolved at the Pt WE should be theoretically deposited on the surface of the Au CE when the potential of the Au CE is set at 0.30 V. No deposition of Pt occurred on the Au CE surface if the potential was set at 0.80 V even though Pt dissolves at the Pt WE.
 ###### 
from test: 13 We reported that Pt dissolution is much enhanced while performing CV until the cathodic potential limit where Pt oxides, which are formed during the anodic scan, are completely reduced.6 In this study, the cathodic lower potential limit (Elower) was fixed at 0.0 V for all CVs where Pt oxides are expected to be completely reduced. In such a condition, as mentioned in the Results and Discussion section, the dissolution mechanism of Pt under CV should be changed by changing the upper potential limit (Eupper) of the CV. We discuss here the mechanisms in three different potential regions of CVs: Eupper<0.70V , 0.70V≤Eupper≤1.2V , and Eupper≥1.4V .
from Soup: 13 To find the potential at which Pt can be deposited on Au CE, three different combinations of potentials were set at the Au CE while running CVs of the Pt WE. In the first case, the potential of the Au CE was set at 0.30 V during both anodic and cathodic scans of the CV. In the second case, the potential of the Au CE was set at 0.30 V during the anodic scan and at 0.80 V during the cathodic scan. In the third case, during the anodic scan the potential of the Au CE was set at 0.80 V and during the cathodic scan it was set at 0.30 V. In all cases, 500 cycles of CV were conducted at the Pt WE, and at the end of the measurement the Au CE surface was analyzed by EPMA for Pt. The EPMA results of the Au CE after CV between 0.0 and 1.4 V are summarized in Table II . The semiquantitative analysis showed the presence of about 0.53% Pt at Au CE when the potential of the Au CE was 0.30 V during both anodic and cathodic scans of the CV, and 0.30% Pt when the potential of the Au CE was 0.30 V during the anodic scan and 0.80 V during the cathodic scan of the CV. This result implies that Pt can be detected when the potential of Au CE is set at 0.30 V during the anodic scan of Pt. When the potential of the Au CE was set at 0.30 V during the cathodic scan and at 0.80 V during the anodic scan of the CV, the amount of Pt detected on the Au CE was very small (about 0.07%). The difference in the amount of Pt in the above three experiments shows that most of the Pt was deposited during the anodic scan of the CV.
 ###### 
from test: 14 Eupper<0.70V . Table IV shows that the anodic dissolution of Pt occurred when Eupper=0.70V . No dissolution of Pt was observed when Eupper=0.60V . This suggests that the dissolution of Pt should not take place when the upper limit of CV is 0.60 V or less during both anodic and cathodic scans of the CV. However, due to the sensitivity limit of this technique, the potential window can be a little different.
from Soup: 14 It is obvious from the above results that Pt is dissolved in the anodic scan of the CV, so we made a further study on the cathodic dissolution. The potential of the Au CE should be set up in a way that Pt can be deposited only during the cathodic scan of the CV. For this purpose, the potential of the Au CE was set at 0.80 V during the anodic scan and at 0.30 V during the cathodic scan while performing 2000 cycles of CV of the Pt WE from 0.0 V until the upper limits (Eupper) of 1.6, 1.4, 1.2, and 1.0 V. As in other cases, at the end of CVs the Au CE was analyzed by EPMA for Pt.

from test: 15 0.70V≤Eupper≤1.2V . The formation of the anodic oxide film on platinum has been extensively studied using CV. The characterization of such oxide film has been the subject of many studies.1, 3, 15–21 However, recently Jerkiewicz et al.29 and Sun et al.37 reported on the detailed characterization of oxide film formed on a platinum surface in various potential regions using high resolution spectroscopic methods. Jerkiewicz et al. ,29 with the help of electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance and Auger electron spectroscopy measurements, confirmed the formation of PtO in the potential region of 1.2–1.4 V. Sun et al. used an angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to conclude that in the potentials of 1.0–1.3 V, the oxidation state for Pt in the film was +2 , indicating the formation of PtO. Because the present study was performed in conditions similar to the above two studies, no attempt was made to characterize the oxide film formed at various potential regions of the CV.
from Soup: 15 The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and EPMA mapping results at Eupper=1.6V are shown in Fig. 6 , and all other results of the semiquantitative EPMA analysis are summarized in Table III . The EPMA results showed that the Pt was deposited at the Au CE only if Eupper=1.6 and 1.4 V at the Pt WE, while no Pt was detected when Eupper was 1.2 and 1.0 V. It can be seen in Fig. 6 that Pt was deposited in large amounts at the Au CE, where a clear gradient in the amount of Pt could be observed along the width. Near the interface with the Pt WE, a semiquantitative point analysis in 30μm diameter showed the presence of about 2.1% Pt compared to only 0.50% on the opposite side. No Pt was detected when Eupper was 1.2 and 1.0 V. From this result, the following two conclusions are made: first, the cathodic dissolution of Pt does take place, 8 and second, the type of Pt oxide formed should be different above and below 1.4 V. The detailed mechanism is discussed in a later section.
 ###### 
from test: 16 In Table III, the results of EPMA analysis during anodic potential limits from 1.0 to 1.6 V are presented. As discussed above, the formation of PtO was assumed to take place at the anodic potential up to 1.2 V by the reactionThe CV in Fig. 4 shows that this oxidation reaction takes place in the potential region from about 0.8 to 1.2 V. In this potential region, simultaneously with the PtO formation, a very small amount of Pt dissolves as hydrated Pt(II) ions in the positive-going scan by the reactionThe reduction of PtO formed during the oxidation process takes place between 0.70 and 0.80 V with the formation of metallic Pt as followsTable III shows that Pt was not deposited on Au CE during the cathodic scan when the anodic potential was reversed from up to 1.2 V. Reaction 3 supports this result because no Pt ion can be formed by cathodic Reaction 3. This suggests that the possibility of electrochemical dissolution via one-electron transfer as hydrated Pt(I) ion should be almost negligible because this reaction can lead to the deposition of Pt on Au CEIt is well known that the chemical dissolution of PtO (Eq. 5) can also produce Pt(II), which can be detected at Au CEBut no trace of Pt was observed at Au CE after 2000 cycles of CV at the upper potential limits of 1.0 and 1.2 V. The rate of chemical dissolution, if any, is probably so low that it is beyond the detection limit of EPMA.
from Soup: 16 To determine the potential at which the dissolution of Pt starts, the potential of the Au CE was set at 0.30 V during the anodic scan and at 0.80 V during the cathodic scan while performing 2000 cycles of CV of the Pt WE from 0.0 V until Eupper=0.80 , 0.70, and 0.60 V. After 2000 cycles of CVs, the Au CE surface was analyzed by EPMA. These results are summarized in Table IV . From the fact that the deposited Pt was detected on the Au CE above 0.70 V and was not detected at 0.60 V, it is assumed that within the sensitivity limit of this technique, the dissolution potential of Pt lies between 0.60 and 0.70 V in the positive potential scan. Because the dissolution of Pt takes place at 0.80 V, the sensitivity of the measurement when the Au CE was set at 0.80 V must be lower compared to the one at 0.30 V.
 ###### 
from test: 17 Eupper≥1.4V . The detection of Pt at Au CE when the anodic potential limit was above 1.4 V suggests the change in the composition of surface oxide above this potential. Some authors have suggested that instead of a change in the composition of the surface oxide, only thickness changes, which passivates the Pt surface,9–11 while some others have suggested that at above 1.4 V a two-layer structure existed comprised of an inner PtO layer and an outer PtO2 layer, leading to a secondary passivation.15, 30 Recently, Sun et al.37 reported that in the potentials of 1.0–1.3 V, the oxidation state for Pt in the oxide film was +2 ; however, at potential greater than 1.3 V, a two-layer structure existed with the inner layer containing Pt(II) and an outer layer containing Pt(IV). The authors have concluded that below 1.3 V, only PtO is formed, while at above 1.3 V both PtO and PtO2 are formed. The results of Sun et al.37 validate the results in Table III that at above 1.4 V the deposition of Pt on the Au CE cannot be explained by the formation of PtO only. Therefore, we assume that a two-layer structure as proposed by Sun et al. exists at a potential greater than 1.4 V with the formation of PtO2 . The formation of PtO2 can take place above 1.4 V by the reactionIf the formation of PtO2 at above 1.4 V were accepted, it would be possible to explain the deposition of Pt at the Au CE during the cathodic scan of the Pt WE. The reduction of PtO2 can be the most probable source of Pt ions that was reduced at the Au CE set at the potential of 0.30 V in this study. A similar conclusion had been drawn by Johnson et al.8 by using a ring-disk electrode system. PtO2 can produce Pt(II) by electrochemical dissolution (Eq. 7) and Pt(IV) by chemical dissolution (Eq. 8). However, it is not possible to indicate the type of reaction from this study The results in Table III and Fig. 6 suggest that the cathodic dissolution of PtO2 was enhanced by an increase in Eupper from 1.4 to 1.6 V probably due to an increase in the amount of PtO2 .37 However, a fuel cell when turned on from a fuel starvation situation seldom shows a potential above 1.4 V. Therefore, the cathodic dissolution of Pt, which is significant only above 1.4 V, should not be a factor in the loss of performance of an operating PEMFC.
from Soup: 17 We reported that Pt dissolution is much enhanced while performing CV until the cathodic potential limit where Pt oxides, which are formed during the anodic scan, are completely reduced. 6 In this study, the cathodic lower potential limit (Elower) was fixed at 0.0 V for all CVs where Pt oxides are expected to be completely reduced. In such a condition, as mentioned in the Results and Discussion section, the dissolution mechanism of Pt under CV should be changed by changing the upper potential limit (Eupper) of the CV. We discuss here the mechanisms in three different potential regions of CVs: Eupper<0.70V , 0.70V≤Eupper≤1.2V , and Eupper≥1.4V .
 ###### 
from test: 18 Pt dissolution was investigated under potential cycle conditions using a CFDE system in combination with EPMA analysis. Within the sensitivity limit of this technique, the following conclusions were drawn:
from Soup: 18 Eupper<0.70V . Table IV shows that the anodic dissolution of Pt occurred when Eupper=0.70V . No dissolution of Pt was observed when Eupper=0.60V . This suggests that the dissolution of Pt should not take place when the upper limit of CV is 0.60 V or less during both anodic and cathodic scans of the CV. However, due to the sensitivity limit of this technique, the potential window can be a little different.
 ###### 
from test: 19 The deposition of metallic Pt from Pt aqua ions took place below about 0.60 V.

from test: 20 The anodic dissolution of Pt occurred at a potential ≥0.70V .

from test: 25 The surface state of Pt is a very important factor that influences its electrocatalytic behaviors.1–3 In a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), Pt at the cathode is exposed at a higher potential where oxidation of Pt occurs. There have been extensive researches on the dissolution and oxidation behaviors of Pt using a potential cycling experiment.4–7 All the studies have found an accelerating effect of the potential cycle on the dissolution of Pt. However, it is not yet clear under what condition of potential cycle the dissolution of Pt takes place. Johnson et al.8 reported the formation of Pt(II) during both the oxidation and the reduction of a Pt electrode in 1 M H2SO4 using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE). Due to the residual current at the ring electrode and the presence of a trace amount of oxygen, even a sufficiently deaerated solution makes it difficult to assign the ring current to the reaction involving a redox reaction of Pt. The current at the ring electrode can be affected by the oxygen reduction reaction at the disk electrode as well. Besides this, the amount of Pt dissolved is very low, which makes it difficult to separate the redox current for Pt from the residual current.
from Soup: 25 Under PEMFC operating conditions, the cathodic dissolution of Pt should not be considered as a factor in determining the loss of performance over time.
 ###### 
from test: 26 The report by Johnson et al.8 that Pt(II) was detected during the reduction in the oxidized Pt electrode implied that the oxidation of Pt leads to the formation of PtO2 . There is a debate regarding the type of Pt oxide formed during anodic polarization in acidic solution. The opinions are divided between the one that favors the formation of PtO and others who favor the formation of PtO2 . Vetter and Schultze,9 Weaver,10 and Damjanovic et al.11 argued that an increase in potential in the positive direction could only lead to the change in the thickness of the oxide layers without any changes in its composition. Some authors considered that potential change could lead to changes in the nature12–16 or structure3, 17 of the oxide layer.

from test: 27 The formation of PtO was proposed by Ord and Ho18 on the basis of optical measurements. It has been considered that the formation of PtO via the intermediate of PtOH takes place by a two-stage mechanism.3, 19–21 However, Kim et al.15 identified the presence of PtO2 . Allen et al. ,22 using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of oxygen adsorbed by Pt, proposed that the initially formed reversible form, PtOH, changed into Pt(OH)2 but not into PtO. Allen et al.22 also suggested that the formation of PtO was observed only at a very anodic potential, ca. 2.4 V. Conway and co-workers1, 3, 17, 23, 24 did extensive work on Pt oxidation and proposed that in acid solutions at potentials up to 0.85 V the formation of PtOH took place, at higher potentials a reorganized HOPt layer was formed, and at potentials starting from 1.1 V an oxide began to form due to the oxidation of PtOH and HOPt to PtO. Harrington25 proposed a two-electron mechanism of the Pt surface oxidation based on the results of the simulation of ac voltammetry of Pt. Biegler et al.12 and Tyurin et al.13, 26, 27 supposed that at a potential up to 2.0 V PtO changed into PtO2 . Mitsushima et al.28 reported the formation of PtO2 during a symmetric potential cycle. Recently, Jerkiewicz et al. ,29 with the help of electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance and Auger electron spectroscopy measurements, confirmed the formation of PtO in the potential range of 1.2–1.4 V. It has been mentioned that at a potential higher than 1.5 V, PtO2 is formed by further oxidation of the already existing PtO layers, resulting in a two-layer system.30 It is clear from the above discussion that there is still no agreement regarding the surface state of Pt.

from test: 28 In this study, a channel-flow double-electrode (CFDE) system, in combination with an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA), was used to clarify the surface state of Pt during a potential cycle. The CFDE is a hydrodynamic method in electrochemistry, which gives us the same information as an RRDE. However, the CFDE has the following advantages: (i) it has a low noise level because the CFDE, unlike RRDE, has no brush friction for the electric contact; (ii) polarization can be done without contamination of the electrolyte because fresh solution is always supplied to the electrodes; (iii) the electrodes can be more easily constructed; and (iv) it is applicable at higher temperatures.31 Authors previously employed the CFDE to study anodic dissolution and passivation of metals such as iron,32, 33 cobalt,34 chromium,35 and copper,36 where quantitative analyses of dissolved metal ions were done. In this study, however, a semiqualitative analysis was done by using CFDE in combination with EPMA because the amount of Pt dissolution was too small to be quantitatively analyzed. The aims of this study were to determine (i) whether cathodic dissolution of Pt takes place or not, (ii) the potential regions in which the formation of PtO and PtO2 takes place, and (iii) the reduction potential of hydrated Pt ion. Based on the above results, a mechanism for the dissolution of Pt during cyclic voltammetry (CV) is proposed.
