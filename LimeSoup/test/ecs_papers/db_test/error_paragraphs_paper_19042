from test: 0 In the Chemical Mechanical Planarization system, the removal profile improvement was attempted by subtly correcting the pressure distribution by means of scraping the underlay assist pad surface made of an elastic solid. As a result of pressure distribution correction, the non-uniformity of the pressure integration was improved from 3% to 0.9%, which results in an improvement from 3.9% to 1.9% in the non-uniformity of the removal rate. Fine adjustment of pressure distribution is the most crucial factor to correct removal profile finely. In addition, the fine adjustment of pressure distribution must be maintained reproducibly to secure stable removal profile. In this study, it was demonstrated that the developed system is a robust polishing system to keep stable pressure distribution without influence on shearing force of polishing. The polishing mechanism is based on the following three features: (1) maintaining a datum plane with a wafer chuck, (2) pressure distribution control using the constitution of the original pad, and (3) a machine configuration that maintains the wafer level in parallel with the pad level.

from test: 1 CMP (Chemical Mechanical Planarization) has been common as a key process in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Both local planarizing polishing and global uniform polishing along with the surface are required in CMP and other surface datum plane polishing. In conventional CMP, pressure is typically applied to the back side of a wafer to push it to a polishing pad for controlling the pressure distribution.1 However, the conventional mechanism is difficult to achieve stable polishing performance because of some issues such as the pressure distribution dependent on not only wafer stiffness or variations of pad attachments, but also mutual leveling control between a wafer surface and a pad surface.2–5

from test: 3 In this report, by using the polishing mechanism, a subtle pressure distribution adjustment was implemented to correct a polishing profile. Precise correction of the pressure distribution means that each setting will be more reproducible and the polishing will be more highly stable and more accurate. To correct the pressure distribution, a desired profile was determined first, and then the pressure non-uniformity was checked while hand-scraping the assist pad surface. As a result, a gentle pressure distribution by X% was achieved without largely deforming the polishing profile. Based on this result, this report will verify from the fundamental viewpoint that this polishing mechanism is a fundamental solution for multi-purpose conformable polishing for a wide variety of applications from thin to thick plates.

The assist pad is made of NBR (Nitrile Butagiene Rubber) which is a type of dense elastic material with a property of no compression permanent set. To remove repulsive force by elastic deformation due to the material poisson's ratio, segmented grooves are formed on the surface of the assist pad. Therefore, a stable pressure distribution is provided to a wafer under repeated down force during polishing. The underlay pad memorizes reproducible pressure distribution corresponding to the location. Therefore, a constant pressure distribution is provided by the underlay pad consistently while absorbing platen transformation and wafer thickness variation.

The actual pressure distribution is measured using a ductile sensor sheet which is used as C-ScanTM model made by Nitta Corp.9,10 It is measured by pressing down to the sensor sheet on the wafer with a polishing pad under static load condition. The actual pressure distribution can be measured by the sensor sheet with 240 mm × 240 mm size. According to the traditional pad attachment which means pad pasting with adhesive tape, pressure distribution was changed largely between the two different pads. This is because pasting operation produces pasting error easily in general. In contrast, according to the developed pad attachment mechanism, two pressure distributions were similar between the two different pads. This is because an assist pad is dominant for the pressure distribution formation and the pad attachment mechanism does not influence the pressure distribution formation. It was verified that the pressure distribution to a wafer is almost constant consistently without depending on pad exchange by pad attachment mechanism and the original pad constitution.

However, a stepwise pressure profile was formed by pressure area separation. In contrast, in the mechanism that was developed, the assist pad absorbs deformation of the platen and thickness variations of the wafer. The pad system provides a gentle pressure distribution on a wafer by adapting widely-ranging height variations in the wafer surface due to the original pad constitution. Therefore, a pre-determined pressure distribution can be repeatedly provided to wafers.

The elements mentioned above are the most critical with regard to the objective of realizing an improved removal profile through a minute change in pressures.

from Soup: 52 According to the polishing system that has been developed, non-uniformity of the removal rate closely correlates with the non-uniformity of the pressure distribution, with a correlation coefficient of 0.99. Non-uniformity of removal rate Y as a function of non-uniformity of pressure distribution X can be expressed as follows, Y = 0.95X + 1.88. The increment for non-uniformity of pressure distribution of 1% corresponds to an increment for non-uniformity of removal rate of 0.95%.

from Soup: 53 With regard to a center-first removal profile with a non-uniformity of removal rate of 3.9%, removal profile improvement was attempted by correcting the pressure distribution. Based on the former relationship between the non-uniformity of removal rate and the non-uniformity of pressure distribution, a profile improvement of about 2% in the non-uniformity of removal rate was aimed for by hand-scraping the assist pad. An improvement from 3% to 0.9% in the non-uniformity of pressure distribution resulted in an improvement from 3.9% to 1.9% in the non-uniformity of removal rate. It was demonstrated that the removal profile was improved by correcting the pressure distribution profile.

from Soup: 54 The achievement of small removal profile improvement by correcting the pressure distribution is due to the following factors, -The wafer vacuum chuck, for which a datum plane of a wafer is maintained. The pressure distribution on a wafer does not depend on its stiffness. -The original polishing mechanism, which enables a pad plane to be consistently parallel to a wafer plane without being affected by shearing force of polishing. -The original pad system, which provides a gentle pressure distribution on a wafer regardless of widely-ranging height variations in the wafer surface. -The original pad attachment mechanism, which enables the pad to provide a stable pressure distribution on a wafer constantly even if the pad is replaced.
