from test: 1 Recently three papers aiming at different objectives but dealing with the same subject, i.e. molten alkali carbonates, have been published. In the first paper1 it has been demonstrated that a molten carbonate infiltrated into the porous backbones of the perovskite cathode material of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is apparently capable of promoting the oxygen reduction process. At any rate, it improves the SOFC performance in the same way, as an effective electrode would do. This observation has been interpreted by the formation of oxygen rich peroxycarbonate ions and by their fast diffusion through the carbonate. In contrast to that, the second paper2 has denied the existence of mobile carbonate ions in molten alkali carbonates since there is not a single unambiguous evidence for that in the literature. The mobility of a bulky ion such as CO2 −3 is in contradiction with relevant facts known from the electrochemical behavior of both molten and solid alkali carbonates. Instead, alkali ions have to be assumed to be the majority charge carriers in both pure and mixed solid and liquid carbonates. In the third paper3 implications of the paradigm shift from carbonate-ion to alkali-ion conduction have been discussed with regard to the principle of functioning of the carbonate-based CO2 permeation membrane. As a consequence, the phenomenon of CO2 permeation has not been found to be in conflict with the absence of carbonate-ion conduction. The alternative interpretation even provides better insight into some aspects of the experimental behavior of such membranes.

It has to be mentioned that in the strict equilibrium case the situation at the interface between Na2CO3, as sodium-ion conductor, and YSZ, as oxygen ion conductor, is not unambiguously defined from thermodynamic point of view.17 The reason is that the chemical potentials of the ionic species O2− and Na+ are not fixed and cannot be fixed, unless the equilibrium is slightly disturbed by partial electronic short-circuit within the carbonate. Only then the circumstances change and the balance of the charge carrier current densities for the ions and electrons in Na2CO3 provides the prerequisite for pinning the chemical potentials at the Na2CO3/YSZ interface17 and making the thermodynamic situation unambiguous. In terms of the processes outlined in Table I, the main point is that the overall cell reaction is not concerned with this matter since the ionic species do ultimately cancel out.

from test: 12 Whereas in a conventional oxygen concentration cell, i.e. without carbonate interlayers, the voltage only results from combustion of hydrogen to water, things are more complex in the cell depicted in Fig. 1. It becomes apparent from Table I that the overall cell reaction encompasses more potential-determining processes. Not only does the water gas shift reaction play a role, but in addition molecular Na2CO3 within either carbonate layers is transported and, besides, molecular CO2 is transferred between the carbonates and the gas phase. Therefore, apart from CO formation the voltage of the cell of Fig. 1 is identical with the voltage of a cell without carbonate interlayers only if the partial pressures of CO2 dissolved in the carbonates equal the CO2 partial pressures of the adjacent gas mixtures and only if pure carbonates are under consideration with their thermodynamic activities being invariant.

In detail, this capability depends on the character of the chemical bonds predominating in the electrode material. Therefore, a molten alkali carbonate as a prominent example of an ionic melt will be more favored as host of ionic oxygen than a solid oxide when both of these materials are compared with each other as alternative oxygen electrodes. The concentration of oxide ions will be expected to be higher in the carbonate because of its more pronounced ionic character. Consequently, the following dissociation equilibrium is conceivable:

from test: 16 Due to the presence of oxide ions, the charge transfer reaction between carbonate and YSZ is purely ionic. This is different from the situation in a conventional O2|Pt|YSZ-electrode. Neither dissociation of diatomic gas molecules nor charge transfer with complex intermediate states from uncharged to twofold negatively charged oxygen need take place. In this way, possible rate-limiting steps causing electrode polarization under load can be eliminated. If a carbonate is interposed between YSZ and the gas phase or if the carbonate replaces a solid oxide electrode, the processes of building gaseous species into the condensed phase are translocated from the oxide/gas interface toward the carbonate/gas interface and their character is modified. The carbonate/gas interaction will be the combination of equilibria 2 and 5. Equilibrium 2 that represents a real phase boundary process does not seem to require a redox reaction and, hence, does not seem to be related to complex charge transfer involving gaseous species. In contrast, equilibrium 5 is being established not only along the interface but within the whole bulk of the carbonate phase. As a result, it may provide a huge and practically inexhaustible reservoir of ionic species, which is primarily a function of the amount of substance available in the electrode system.

from test: 17 Another aspect will likewise speak for better kinetics of the ion transfer reaction in a carbonate-based rather than an oxide-based oxygen electrode. The effective contact area for oxygen ion exchange at the interface between the solid electrolyte and a solid oxide electrode will never be as large as the area between a solid and a liquid. This is due to the nanoscopic roughness of the interfaces, which reduces the effective contact area to micropoints and lines if two solids adjoin each other whereas a liquid can much better guarantee intimate contact by leveling out any surface irregularity. The same applies to the effectiveness of the electron transfer reaction toward the electronically conducting phase because the contact between a solid oxide and a solid metal underlies the same restrictions as outlined above. They are overcome if a liquid is sandwiched between the two materials.

from test: 19 Apart from the nature of the charge transfer process, the transport of potential-determining species toward the electrolyte surface or away from it is another crucial factor determining the polarization resistance of an electrode. The outstanding performance of an oxide-ion electrode requires fast oxygen-ion transport. The question is as to whether this requirement can be met by an alkali carbonate. At first glance, high oxygen ion conductivity seems to be incompatible with the view that alkali carbonates primarily are alkali-ion conductors. However, as recently demonstrated for the phenomenon of CO2 permeation,3 the gas transport through a carbonate-based membrane does not necessitate carbonate-ion diffusion. The same is true for oxygen transport. Alkali ion diffusion coupled with gas absorption and desorption in which the membrane material actively participates by dissociation, formation and convection is not only the prerequisite for CO2 permeation but also for O2 permeation through a gastight condensed phase. This is demonstrated by means of Fig. 2 that shows an alkali carbonate membrane exposed to a CO2 and O2 containing gas atmosphere with high partial pressures at the right membrane surface and low pressures at the left surface. For promoting the permeation, the two membrane surfaces are in contact with electronically conducting layers with both of them being connected over a finite load resistance, RL. At elevated temperature the following processes will proceed under load:

from Soup: 25 The resultant of the preceding five processes is transfer of molecular oxygen and carbon dioxide from the right to the left side with the molecular ratio of the transported amounts being 1:2. As it is apparent from the quantitative relationships recently derived for the particle flux through an alkali carbonate membrane, 3 the amount of oxygen carried from one side of the membrane to the other is a maximum only if the carbonate is not in contact with an oxygen-ion conducting medium. That means the condition under which Gong et al. 1 employed the carbonate as oxygen electrode, namely by infiltration into the porous support of a perovskite, i.e. an oxygen-ion conductor, does not guarantee the highest oxygen permeation rate. Instead, the carbonate should be electronically short-circuited by dispersion into a metal sponge. Then the oxygen permeation flux amounts to: 3 where F is the Faraday constant and a ⊕ as well as a ⊖ are the electronic conduction parameters 19 for p- and n-conduction, respectively, of the alkali carbonate. The superscripts ′ and ″ refer to the right and the left interface, respectively, of the membrane illustrated in Fig. 2 . κ is the load parameter, the magnitude of which is determined by the ratio between the Ohmic resistance due to ionic conduction of the carbonate, R i , and the load resistance R L :

If the carbonate is solid, the process will be impossible which is why the phase boundaries of a solid membrane will migrate from left to the right.
from Soup: 26 The combination of the features discussed above ought to be a good prerequisite for an alkali carbonate layer to serve as an effective oxygen electrode. If such a layer is, on one side, in contact with an oxygen-ion conducting solid electrolyte, e.g. YSZ, and, on the other side, is exposed to an O 2 and CO 2 containing gas atmosphere the processes illustrated in Fig. 3 are conceivable. Under cathodic load with a net transport of negative charges from right to left, the electric current causes oxygen ions within YSZ to move away from the YSZ/carbonate interface (Process 1 in Fig. 3 ). For balancing out the resulting oxygen deficiency, oxygen ions dissolved in the carbonate melt are induced to cross the YSZ/carbonate interface (Process 2). As a result, equilibrium 5 established in the carbonate is disturbed and is shifted in favor of oxygen ion release due to carbonate dissociation (Process 3). Associated with this, the concentration of alkali ions and the CO 2 partial pressure at the respective interface are increased. The only possible ion diffusion process throughout the carbonate membrane is that of alkali ions. These ions move (Process 4) from the left side, where they are produced due to carbonate dissociation, to the right side where they induce equilibrium 2 to be shifted in favor of carbonate formation, in accordance with eq. 8 (Process 5). The precondition for that is the delivery of electrons (Process 6) from the electronically conducting phase (EC) of the electrode to the three-phase boundary EC/carbonate/gas, the electron transfer through the phase boundary (Process 7) and, simultaneously, the delivery of gaseous species. Therefore, O 2 and CO 2 have to diffuse toward the carbonate surface (Process 8), through the gas phase or along the pores of the electronically conductive phase if the latter forms a porous structure. Because of carbonate formation at the right interface and carbonate dissociation at the left one, enrichment and depletion of M 2 CO 3 molecules take place which drives a carbonate convection flow from right to the left (Process 9). Another consequence is the CO 2 release at the carbonate/YSZ interface. As a result, the saturation concentration of the gas will be locally exceeded and, thus, gas bubbles are freed which is particularly facilitated by using a porous support into which the molten carbonate is infiltrated. Alternatively, CO 2 bubbles have to drift through the bulk of the melt for which the driving force is the slightly higher gas pressure inside the bubbles in comparison with the CO 2 partial pressure in the gas atmosphere adjacent to the carbonate (Process 10).

from test: 27 The resultant of the preceding five processes is transfer of molecular oxygen and carbon dioxide from the right to the left side with the molecular ratio of the transported amounts being 1:2. As it is apparent from the quantitative relationships recently derived for the particle flux through an alkali carbonate membrane,3 the amount of oxygen carried from one side of the membrane to the other is a maximum only if the carbonate is not in contact with an oxygen-ion conducting medium. That means the condition under which Gong et al.1 employed the carbonate as oxygen electrode, namely by infiltration into the porous support of a perovskite, i.e. an oxygen-ion conductor, does not guarantee the highest oxygen permeation rate. Instead, the carbonate should be electronically short-circuited by dispersion into a metal sponge. Then the oxygen permeation flux amounts to:3 where F is the Faraday constant and a⊕ as well as a⊖ are the electronic conduction parameters19 for p- and n-conduction, respectively, of the alkali carbonate. The superscripts ′ and ″ refer to the right and the left interface, respectively, of the membrane illustrated in Fig. 2. κ is the load parameter, the magnitude of which is determined by the ratio between the Ohmic resistance due to ionic conduction of the carbonate, Ri, and the load resistance RL:
from Soup: 27 Each of the processes highlighted in Fig. 3 is a possible rate-limiting step in the oxygen transfer kinetics. In view of the nature of these steps most of them are invariant upon reversing the direction of the charge transport from cathodic to anodic load, at least some of them may be expected to be invariant. The only anodic process that definitely cannot proceed in the same manner as in cathodic direction is the transport of gaseous CO 2 through the carbonate melt, i.e. the opposite of process 10. The formation of bubbles and their drift from the carbonate/gas interface to the carbonate/YSZ interface is clearly out of question, which means that the opposite of process 10 may only be effectuated by gas diffusion. Since data on the diffusivity of CO 2 in an alkali melt are unknown any statement about the efficiency of this process will remain speculative. Nevertheless, the positive role a carbonate may play as a cathode material will not be called into doubt by that.

from test: 28 The combination of the features discussed above ought to be a good prerequisite for an alkali carbonate layer to serve as an effective oxygen electrode. If such a layer is, on one side, in contact with an oxygen-ion conducting solid electrolyte, e.g. YSZ, and, on the other side, is exposed to an O2 and CO2 containing gas atmosphere the processes illustrated in Fig. 3 are conceivable. Under cathodic load with a net transport of negative charges from right to left, the electric current causes oxygen ions within YSZ to move away from the YSZ/carbonate interface (Process 1 in Fig. 3). For balancing out the resulting oxygen deficiency, oxygen ions dissolved in the carbonate melt are induced to cross the YSZ/carbonate interface (Process 2). As a result, equilibrium 5 established in the carbonate is disturbed and is shifted in favor of oxygen ion release due to carbonate dissociation (Process 3). Associated with this, the concentration of alkali ions and the CO2 partial pressure at the respective interface are increased. The only possible ion diffusion process throughout the carbonate membrane is that of alkali ions. These ions move (Process 4) from the left side, where they are produced due to carbonate dissociation, to the right side where they induce equilibrium 2 to be shifted in favor of carbonate formation, in accordance with eq. 8 (Process 5).

from Soup: 28 It becomes obvious from comparing Fig. 3 with Pizzini’s 20 classical graph for visualization of the electrode processes in conventional oxygen electrodes such as EC|O 2 |YSZ or EC|O 2 |solid oxide|YSZ (cf. Fig. 1 in ref. 20 ) that the carbonate|EC|CO 2 , O 2 |YSZ-electrode appears to be more complex, at least with regard to the number of possible rate-limiting steps. This need not necessarily mean a more sluggish behavior of the carbonate electrode. A striking argument for fast kinetics is the much higher ionic conductivity of a liquid carbonate or carbonate mixture in comparison with that of a solid oxide electrode, especially at intermediate temperatures, which is demonstrated in Fig. 4 by taking the conductivity of YSZ as a bench-mark value. At 600 °C the ratio between these two quantities is larger than 420. To what extent the remaining processes illustrated in Fig. 3 may either annihilate the advantageous effect of ionic diffusion or further contribute to promotion of oxygen transfer as a whole is difficult to estimate. At any rate, the positive practical experience Gong et al. 1 reported on give legitimate reason to hope that the magnitude of total electrode polarization is significantly smaller in a carbonate electrode than it is in a conventional SOFC electrode, at least under cathodic load.

Therefore, further experimental work is needed to qualify the advantages and disadvantages of such an electrode. The same applies to the behavior of a carbonate under anodic load.

from Soup: 30 The employment of an oxygen concentration cell with alkali carbonate-based oxygen electrodes is obvious for thermodynamic reasons, at least as far as electrochemical applications under equilibrium or near-equilibrium conditions are concerned. Moreover, liquid alkali carbonates exhibit features that prove to be good prerequisites for their functioning as effective oxygen electrodes under load conditions: (i) solvent for oxygen ions; (ii) guarantee for intimate contact by compensation of surface roughness; (iii) high oxygen permeability; (iv) high conductivity in comparison with an oxide ion conductor. These features may account for the excellent electrode performance of an alkali carbonate recently reported in the literature. The present interpretation is in accordance with the proposition of alkali-ion conduction in the carbonate and does not need avail itself of the unlikely hypothesis of highly mobile peroxycarbonate ions, especially since they are still much more bulky and voluminous than the anyway bulky and slowly diffusing carbonate ions.
