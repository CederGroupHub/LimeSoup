from test: 0 We report measurements of the conductivity of a series of mixtures of ionic liquids and acids. We find in particular that mixtures of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EMI, C6H11N2 )–bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [TFSI, (CF3SO2)2N ] with the acid H–TFSI have promising conduction properties for applications to fuel cell membranes. However, these mixtures have a peculiar dependence of conductivity on acid concentration. We present a series of model calculations at coarse-grained and molecular dynamics levels which suggest that the observed nonmonotonic dependence of conductivity on acid concentration arises because of proton clustering in the mixtures and possibly because of phase separation at the higher acid concentrations.

from test: 1 The symmetrical components, including the outer end plates, current collectors, and flow fields from a Fuel Cell Technologies 50cm2 fuel cell, were used to build a liquid conductivity cell, which contained a three-way glass cell with a volume of about 25mL for liquid electrolyte testing. Two bottom sides of the three-way glass cell separated by a length of 4cm had attached circular dispersed catalyst (Pt on carbon, 0.4mg∕cm2 )/gas diffusion layers with an active area of 3.0cm2 . Gaskets attached to glass plates with holes served as leakage protection. A flexible electric heating tape was wrapped around the glass cell for heating. A thermometer and a pressure release adapter were connected to the top of the glass cell. Every component of the liquid cell was cleaned and dried before assembling and then placed in a dry box, which was continuously purged with N2 . All the ionic liquids and acids were dried under vacuum at high temperature. For each experiment, more than 20mL of ionic liquid was charged into the glass cell. Then a measurement of conductivity was made on the neat ionic liquid. Then a measured quantity of acid was added and another conductivity measurement was carried out and so on, with a series of incremental additions of acid to obtain the conductivity as a function of acid concentration in the ionic liquid–acid mixture. All the material charges and measurements were carried out in a dry box. There were no indications of chemical instability of the ionic liquid at either electrode during any of the experiments.
from Soup: 1 Interest in membrane materials for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells has recently increased because of the international effort to improve fuel cell performance, particularly for automotive applications and the move toward a possible hydrogen economy. 1 In particular, there are strong engineering reasons 2 to seek a proton conducting membrane which will work at higher temperatures (up to 120°C ) and/or at a lower water content than possible with the polyperfluorosulfonic acid polymers being used today, such as DuPont’s Nafion. Membranes of this type are highly dependent on water for proton conduction. At higher temperatures (90°C) or lower cell humidification levels, the membrane water content is much lower and the conductivity drops dramatically, so these two goals are closely related. Though a variety of other polymeric membrane materials has been explored, none has yielded the desired improvements in performance. 3

from test: 2 To make the conductivity measurements, prepurified hydrogen gas was bubbled through the liquid cell through the flow fields and catalyst-coated layers on both sides of the cell. Bubbling the hydrogen on both sides of the cell allowed equilibrium to be maintained for the H2↔2H++2e− reaction at both electrodes so that the open-circuit voltage was zero. (This procedure is called a “hydrogen pump” experiment in the literature.11) Applying a direct current to the cell, hydrogen was consumed at the anode and generated at the cathode. The dc resistances were measured from the slopes of the current–voltage curves (from −1.0to1.0V ). The current–voltage curves were scanned using Z-Corrware software, a potentiostat (PAR, 273A), and a frequency response analyzer (Solatron, 1260). Each concentration was measured several times over a period of up to 60min until a stable result was obtained. The conductivity was then calculated from the average dc resistance using the following formula: Conductivity=(1∕R) L∕A , where R is the electrolyte resistance, L is the distance between the two electrodes, and A is the active surface area of electrodes.
from Soup: 2 For these reasons, another membrane material, possibly containing a nonaqueous, nonvolatile plasticizer with a high conductivity would be desirable. Some previous work reported studies of ionic liquids as possible additives to fuel cell electrolytes. 4 – 7 Somewhat similar systems containing polymers, ionic liquids, and lithium salts 8 , 9 have been investigated for use in lithium polymer batteries (see also Ref. 10 ). In the study reported here, we studied mixtures of acids with a bulky anion and ionic liquids in which both the cation and anion were relatively large. This contrasts with some earlier studies (e.g., Ref. 7 ) in which the focus is on ionic liquids containing one anionic and one cationic species. The motivation for this choice was the hope that, in such acid–ion liquid mixtures, the proton mobility would be enhanced and that, in particular, this might be particularly the case when the two components in the mixture had a common anion. We do find cases in which such enhancement of proton conductivity occurs in mixtures with a common anion, and we report details of a study of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EMI, C6H11N2 )–bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [TFSI, (CF3SO2)2N ] which has a high conductivity at temperatures below 100°C at certain acid–salt ratios (Fig. 1 ).
 ###### 
from test: 3 Using the cell just described, conductivities of the series of ionic liquid–acid mixtures were measured (Table I). Materials prepared in anhydrous form were stored and handled in a dry box to prevent adsorption of water. The ionic liquids were prepared according to the procedures described in U.S. Patent 6,372,829.12 The ionic liquids were dried at 100°C and 10−2Torr for 12–24h . In a few of the ionic/liquid mixtures, to check whether the observed ionic conductivities were due to water contamination, we carried out additional experiments in which small (2–3 equivalents) amounts of water were added to the mixtures and observed very little change in the measured ionic conductivities. The imide acids were prepared according to procedures described in U.S. Patent 5,874,616.13 The methide acids were prepared according to the procedures described in U.S. Patent 5,554,664.14
from Soup: 3 The dependence of conductivity on the acid–salt ratio is unexpected: The largest measured conductivity is at large salt–acid ratios and declines over most of the concentration range as the proton concentration increases. Viscosity measurements showed that the “Walden rule” does not apply, even qualitatively: There is no simple correlation between the viscosity and the conductivity. We report a detailed molecular dynamics model whose use in a simulation reproduces the observed behavior and discuss an interpretation in terms of the formation of bound proton clusters as the proton concentration increases.
 ###### 
from test: 4 The conductivity results shown in Fig. 2 indicate that the EMI–TFSI+H-TFSI is the best conducting mixture, followed by EMI–TFSI+H–N(SO2C2F5)2 and EMI–TFSI+H–C(SO2CF3)3 . Most combinations suggest that very high levels of ionic liquid with lower levels of acid are needed to achieve the highest possible proton conductivity (between 80 and 90mol% ). The only exception is ImH-TFSI+H-TFSI , for which the conductivity peaked at 50mol% ionic liquid. EMI–TFSI has a low viscosity at room temperature, a low melting point (−18°C) , and thermal stability up to at least 350°C . The proton conductivity is more than 10−2S∕cm when 10mol% of H-TFSI is added to 90mol% of EMI–TFSI. That is a significant improvement when compared to the very low (or zero) proton conductivity of H-TFSI without ionic liquid additive.

from test: 5 The temperature dependence of the conductivity was measured for several of these systems with results shown in Fig. 3. Plotted as lnσ vs 1∕T , most of these data showed linear behavior (as shown for example in Fig. 4) corresponding to an activated conduction process with an activation energy of about 0.2eV .

from test: 6 In the interesting case of EMI–TSFI H-TFSI mixtures, we measured the viscosity for a range of compositions with results displayed in Fig. 5. The viscosity varied monotonically with composition, unlike the conductivity. In particular, the viscosity increased significantly between 100% ionic liquid and 10% acid while the conductivity rose rapidly to the largest value observed over the composition range. The viscosity was not correlated in a simple way with the observed conductivity and therefore does not provide a simple qualitative explanation of the phenomenon. Nevertheless, the atomic interactions which led to viscosity were clearly the same as the ones which led to the conductivity and they were taken into account in our molecular dynamics calculations, reported below.

from test: 7 To account for the experimental results, and in particular to try to understand the unexpected dependence of the measured conductivity on the acid–salt ratio, we made models and carried out numerical simulations at several levels. At the macroscopic level we made kinetic Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to try to understand, at a qualitative level, how the dependence of the conductivity on acid–salt ratio might arise. Second, we performed first-principles calculations on small clusters to determine the local energetics and force fields. We then performed molecular dynamics simulations to study the mechanism of transport. Finally, we returned to coarse-grained models to further explore the mechanism of transport. We assume in all these modeling studies that, in the steady state in the experiments, current is entirely carried by the protons, by which we mean that for every electron passing from the cathode to the solution, a proton is reduced, and similarly all electrons transferred from the solution to the anode oxidize protons. By simple charge and mass conservation considerations, this will be the case in steady state (dc) as long as there are no faradaic reactions occurring at the electrodes involving the cation or anion of the ionic liquid. This is believed to be the case to a good approximation in the proton pump experiment described above. The point is discussed somewhat further in the discussion section.
from Soup: 7 The conductivity results shown in Fig. 2 indicate that the EMI–TFSI+H-TFSI is the best conducting mixture, followed by EMI–TFSI+H–N(SO2C2F5)2 and EMI–TFSI+H–C(SO2CF3)3 . Most combinations suggest that very high levels of ionic liquid with lower levels of acid are needed to achieve the highest possible proton conductivity (between 80 and 90mol% ). The only exception is ImH-TFSI+H-TFSI , for which the conductivity peaked at 50mol% ionic liquid. EMI–TFSI has a low viscosity at room temperature, a low melting point (−18°C) , and thermal stability up to at least 350°C . The proton conductivity is more than 10−2S∕cm when 10mol% of H-TFSI is added to 90mol% of EMI–TFSI. That is a significant improvement when compared to the very low (or zero) proton conductivity of H-TFSI without ionic liquid additive.
 ###### 
from test: 8 Note that the experimental conductivity data reported above imply strong collective effects: If the protons diffused or drifted independently of one another then the conductivity would be of the form σ=nHμH∣e∣ , where nH is the number density of protons and μH is the mobility which, under the assumption that each proton moves independently of the others, would be independent of nH . But, the expression σ=nHμH∣e∣ then implies a negative slope in the data of Fig. 2, whereas a strong positive slope is observed over most of the range of acid–salt ratios for the EMI–TFSI, H-TFSI mixtures.
from Soup: 8 The temperature dependence of the conductivity was measured for several of these systems with results shown in Fig. 3 . Plotted as lnσ vs 1∕T , most of these data showed linear behavior (as shown for example in Fig. 4 ) corresponding to an activated conduction process with an activation energy of about 0.2eV .
 ###### 
from test: 9 The simplest type of collective effect would be steric blocking of one proton by another. We can roughly model this effect with a lattice model, in which each proton can reside on a lattice site and hops to neighboring sites with a fixed probability at each time step in a Monte Carlo simulation, but with the proviso that the hopping does not occur if the site to which the proton is trying to hop is already occupied by a proton. However, as shown in Fig. 6, such a steric blocking model does not account, even qualitatively, for most of the features of the data for (EMI–TFSI)–(H-TFSI) in Fig. 2 because, though the nonmonotonicity is reproduced it occurs symmetrically with a peak at half molar acid concentration [as it does in the experimental data for C2N2H (ImH)–TFSI, H-TFSI]. Because our molecular dynamics simulations of (EMI–TFSI)–(H-TFSI) described below showed evidence of proton clustering, we also explored the effects of proton clustering in such a Monte Carlo (MC) lattice model, to see if that could be regarded as the essential feature accounting for the concentration dependence. Figure 6 illustrates that the most naive clustering model also fails to reproduce the essential features for (EMI–TFSI)–(H-TFSI), though the MC result is similar to the experimental one for EMI–SO3C4F9 , H-SO3C4F9 . However, a lattice model in which clusters of protons have different dynamical behavior than isolated protons does reproduce the main qualitative features as shown in Fig. 6. (A few details concerning the MC simulations appear in Appendix 1.) We suggest a possible origin for such a difference in dynamical behavior of clusters in terms of overscreening in the Discussion section below. These MC results indicate that the dependence of proton conductivity on acid concentration seen in (EMI–TFSI)–(H-TFSI) requires collective effects in which the protons are not moving independently, and that simple steric blocking or clustering is not sufficient for a qualitative understanding.

Nevertheless, the atomic interactions which led to viscosity were clearly the same as the ones which led to the conductivity and they were taken into account in our molecular dynamics calculations, reported below.
 ###### 
from test: 10 To obtain a more complete picture of the transport mechanism including realistic physical interactions and taking full account of ion mobility, we developed an atomistically detailed molecular dynamics (MD) model of the EMI–TFSI, H-TFSI system. We parametrized this model from first principles (rather than using one of the available codes15 or parametrizations16) for several reasons: (i) When this work, whose submission for publication was substantially delayed by intellectual property concerns, was initiated there were practically no MD model parametrizations for ionic liquids in the literature, (ii) there are still no published parametrizations of this particular system, (iii) we wished to parametrize the interaction of protons with the anions with particular care, and (iv) we have a general preference over 25years of MD simulation for working with locally developed codes and parametrizations. In Appendix 2 we compare aspects of the code and parametrization with one of the other published ones, showing that they are similar where they can be compared in regard to the representation of TFSI. The only physical feature lacking in our MD model and present in another published parametrization of ionic liquids of which we are aware is polarizability of the ions, which was included by one set of authors17 for a neat ionic liquid (not an ionic liquid–acid mixture). Reference 17 reported very small effects on structural features except in the nearest-neighbor anion–anion radial distribution function. There were also significant effects of polarizability on viscosity. Extension of the model used here to include polarizability would be desirable and may occur in the future.

 ###### 
from test: 11 The first step in this development was to carry out a number of first-principles calculations on small clusters of the constituents of the system. These first-principles calculations had two purposes. They provided a database for development of a quantitatively realistic MD model (for which results are described in the next section) and they provided some insight into possible microscopic proton hopping mechanisms. (It is of some precautionary general interest that at least one of the hopping mechanisms suggested by the small cluster calculations was later shown by the larger scale MD calculations to be less important than another mechanism only made possible by the stabilizing coulombic effects of larger numbers of atoms than we could treat in first principles.) We used Hartree–Fock calculations with the HF∕6-31G* basis set in the Gaussian suite of codes18 for a number of structures of atomic conformations of the EMI and TFSI ions individually, for a proton placed at various positions along a line between the nitrogens of two TFSI anions and for a proton placed at various positions along a line between the nitrogen and an oxygen of two TFSI anions, and for a TFSI–EMI pair in various configurations. Some more details concerning the fitting database appear in Appendix 2, where comparisons of the resulting parameter set with those obtained in Ref. 19 are also provided. To test the adequacy of the HF∕6-31G* basis, we repeated some of the first-principles calculations using a larger basis set with almost no change in the results, as reported in more detail in Appendix 2.

We show first-principles energies and the fit of the molecular dynamics model to them for the TFSI-H+–TFSI cluster in Fig. 7 and 8. The structure of the calculated ground-state atomic configuration of the TFSI-H+–TFSI cluster is shown in Fig. 9.

from test: 13 We note from Fig. 7 and 8 that in the TFSI-H+–TFSI cluster, the position of the proton is bound to the nitrogen and Fig. 7 might suggest a hopping mechanism from N to N as a likely one for describing the proton transport. However, we found, as described in the next section that, in the presence of many anions and cations, the proton is actually solvated mainly by the oxygen of the TFSI ions.

from test: 14 Using the MD model defined and parametrized as described in the last section and in Appendix 2, we explored its predictions for the neat ionic liquid in the absence of acid and for a series of acid–ionic liquid mixtures. For the studies of neat ionic liquid, we studied a system of 108 TFSI anions and 108 EMI cations (3672 atoms) in the fixed number, volume, and energy (NVE) ensemble in a cubic box of dimensions 36.00×36.00×36.00Å , which was chosen to give the experimental density of 1.52g∕cm3 at 295K ,20 using a primitive “thermostat” to keep the kinetic energy near the mean value expected at 300K . The relaxation simulations continued until the thermostat stopped rescaling the velocities and the average values of the internal potential energy stopped changing. In the simulation, equations of motion were integrated using the Verlet algorithm, and periodic boundary conditions were applied. To improve efficiency, a nonbonded neighbor list method was used, and the cutoff was set to 13.5Å . For the long-range coulomb interactions, the standard Ewald summation was used. In the Ewald summation calculations, corrections of the standard self-interaction term, and molecular correction which is the reciprocal Ewald term for the interactions between bound atoms, were included. In our MD simulation, the time step was 0.5fs .

from test: 15 The initial structure for the simulation of the neat EMI–TFSI salt was chosen to be the crystal structure of NaCl. The MD simulations for pure salt were run for about 2ns to get the system to reach equilibrium. To simulate acid–ionic liquid mixtures, protons were substituted for EMI cations in the equilibrated pure salt system one by one until the mol fractions of proton in the mixtures of the EMI–TFSI with the acid H-TFSI were 4.63, 10.19, 13.89, 16.67, and 23.15%, respectively. For each proton concentration system, we repeated the above procedure, starting from the pure EMI–TFSI system, 10 times to get 10 samples of each proton concentration system. MD on the acid–ionic liquid mixtures samples were each run for 2ns to obtain equilibrium. Finally, the MD simulations were run for an additional 50ps to collect data every time step for the later conductivity calculations. (Longer data collection times did not appreciably affect the results except in the case of the 18 proton system, which was dynamically very sluggish.) Averages over 10 samples were made to obtain the final conductivity results for each proton concentration, effectively using 500ps=0.5ns of total data collection for each acid concentration. Variances discussed below indicate that data collection was sufficient to yield reproducible results with the possible exception of the 18 proton system as discussed below.
from Soup: 15 We compare structural parameters for the isolated ions of the ionic liquid as obtained from first principles, the fitted molecular dynamics model, and X-ray experiment in Tables XI and XII . We show first-principles energies and the fit of the molecular dynamics model to them for the TFSI-H+–TFSI cluster in Fig. 7 and 8 . The structure of the calculated ground-state atomic configuration of the TFSI-H+–TFSI cluster is shown in Fig. 9 . More details of the fitting procedures and the forms of the molecular dynamics force-field potentials as well as a listing of the fitted parameters appear in Appendix 2 .
 ###### 
from test: 16 In the neat liquid, the pressure in the simulation as measured using the virial was about 20atm . To interpret the pure liquid results, we first measured the radial distribution functions of the ion centers of mass, to get an idea of the liquid structure. We show TFSI–TFSI, TFSI–EMI, and EMI–EMI radial distribution functions of the centers of masses of the ions as calculated from the MD model in Fig. 10. The anion–cation correlations are significant. From running coordination numbers (not shown) obtained by integrating these radial distribution functions, we found that there are approximately 6 anion neighbors in the first solvation shell of each cation and vice versa. The anion–anion correlations were less significant but definitely present, whereas, except for steric effects, the cation positions did not appear to be correlated at all. Unfortunately, we did not find any experimental data with which to compare these simulation data on the ionic liquid structure.
from Soup: 16 We note from Fig. 7 and 8 that in the TFSI-H+–TFSI cluster, the position of the proton is bound to the nitrogen and Fig. 7 might suggest a hopping mechanism from N to N as a likely one for describing the proton transport. However, we found, as described in the next section that, in the presence of many anions and cations, the proton is actually solvated mainly by the oxygen of the TFSI ions.

from test: 17 Because the EMI cations have a planar structure, it seemed possible that there might be some orientational correlations of the molecules in the liquid, and that these could have some effect on the proton conductivity. Accordingly, we measured the following orientational correlation function in the model liquidHere, i and j run over cations or anions depending on whether we are calculating partial anion–anion, anion–cation, or cation–cation correlation functions. n̂i is a unit vector in the direction of that principal axis of the ion i which has the largest moment of inertia.

from Soup: 17 Using the MD model defined and parametrized as described in the last section and in Appendix 2 , we explored its predictions for the neat ionic liquid in the absence of acid and for a series of acid–ionic liquid mixtures. For the studies of neat ionic liquid, we studied a system of 108 TFSI anions and 108 EMI cations (3672 atoms) in the fixed number, volume, and energy (NVE) ensemble in a cubic box of dimensions 36.00×36.00×36.00Å , which was chosen to give the experimental density of 1.52g∕cm3 at 295K , 20 using a primitive “thermostat” to keep the kinetic energy near the mean value expected at 300K . The relaxation simulations continued until the thermostat stopped rescaling the velocities and the average values of the internal potential energy stopped changing. In the simulation, equations of motion were integrated using the Verlet algorithm, and periodic boundary conditions were applied. To improve efficiency, a nonbonded neighbor list method was used, and the cutoff was set to 13.5Å . For the long-range coulomb interactions, the standard Ewald summation was used. In the Ewald summation calculations, corrections of the standard self-interaction term, and molecular correction which is the reciprocal Ewald term for the interactions between bound atoms, were included. In our MD simulation, the time step was 0.5fs .

from test: 18 We show EMI–TFSI, TFSI–TFSI, and EMI–EMI orientational correlation functions as calculated from the MD model in Fig. 11. From Fig. 11, we conclude that at 300K local orientational order exists in the neat ionic liquid, but no long-range order is found. We conclude that, in view of the weakness of these correlation effects, it is unlikely that orientational correlations play a major role in the dramatic dependence of the conductivity on proton concentration which is seen in the data.
from Soup: 18 The initial structure for the simulation of the neat EMI–TFSI salt was chosen to be the crystal structure of NaCl. The MD simulations for pure salt were run for about 2ns to get the system to reach equilibrium. To simulate acid–ionic liquid mixtures, protons were substituted for EMI cations in the equilibrated pure salt system one by one until the mol fractions of proton in the mixtures of the EMI–TFSI with the acid H-TFSI were 4.63, 10.19, 13.89, 16.67, and 23.15%, respectively. For each proton concentration system, we repeated the above procedure, starting from the pure EMI–TFSI system, 10 times to get 10 samples of each proton concentration system. MD on the acid–ionic liquid mixtures samples were each run for 2ns to obtain equilibrium. Finally, the MD simulations were run for an additional 50ps to collect data every time step for the later conductivity calculations. (Longer data collection times did not appreciably affect the results except in the case of the 18 proton system, which was dynamically very sluggish.) Averages over 10 samples were made to obtain the final conductivity results for each proton concentration, effectively using 500ps=0.5ns of total data collection for each acid concentration. Variances discussed below indicate that data collection was sufficient to yield reproducible results with the possible exception of the 18 proton system as discussed below.

from test: 19 To calculate proton conductivities in the ionic liquid–acid mixtures, protons were introduced into the MD model for the ionic liquid. (Cations were removed, and protons were substituted for them.) Some calculated radial distributions for oxygen and nitrogen around the protons are shown in Fig. 12. The protons are typically solvated by four oxygens, of which two are from one TFSI molecule and two are from another TFSI molecule. The first peak in the proton–nitrogen radial distribution function is between 3 and 4Å and contains three nitrogen neighbors. Thus anions are involved in this solvation structure. A snapshot of the local structure is also shown in Fig. 13.
from Soup: 19 In the neat liquid, the pressure in the simulation as measured using the virial was about 20atm . To interpret the pure liquid results, we first measured the radial distribution functions of the ion centers of mass, to get an idea of the liquid structure. We show TFSI–TFSI, TFSI–EMI, and EMI–EMI radial distribution functions of the centers of masses of the ions as calculated from the MD model in Fig. 10 . The anion–cation correlations are significant. From running coordination numbers (not shown) obtained by integrating these radial distribution functions, we found that there are approximately 6 anion neighbors in the first solvation shell of each cation and vice versa. The anion–anion correlations were less significant but definitely present, whereas, except for steric effects, the cation positions did not appear to be correlated at all. Unfortunately, we did not find any experimental data with which to compare these simulation data on the ionic liquid structure.

from test: 20 To study proton transport in the MD model, we directly calculated the conductivity at finite frequencies by using the following well-known relation21 The sum on H is over protons (charge qH ) and the sum on j runs over protons and all the atoms of each ion (charge qj ). uH(t) and uj(t) are the corresponding ion velocities. The brackets indicate an average over the times τ. As an example, we show results in Fig. 14 for the calculated frequency-dependent conductivity for the system containing 5 protons at 385K .

from test: 21 To estimate the zero frequency proton conductivity from such data, we fit the conductivity to the formula σ(ω)=σ(0)+bω2 to extrapolate to zero frequency. The results of this procedure depended on the maximum frequency which was used in the database, which was fit to the form σ(ω)=σ(0)+bω2 . To find the best value of the maximum frequency to use, we calculated the variance (the maximum frequency used is ωNf )and the variance of the meanof the data set from the fit as a function of the maximum frequency and used the maximum frequency which gave the smallest variance of the mean, as illustrated in Fig. 15. With this procedure we extrapolated all the partial conductivities to zero frequency. Using this procedure and quite long simulation runs (2ns) , we found reproducible values of the dc conductivity at most of the acid concentrations for which calculations were done. However, in the 18 proton computational sample (16.7mol% acid) we found large sample-to-sample fluctuations in the calculated conductivity. Accordingly, we report results for the average calculated conductivity and the variance for 10 computational samples at each proton concentration in Fig. 16. In that figure, a correction described in Appendix 3 has been applied, using the calculated partial conductivities, to take account of the fact that in the experiment, the anion and cationic currents are not allowed to flow. Taking this constraint into account, the effective proton conductivity measured iswhere σHH is the portion of the conductivity calculated from the proton–proton current–current correlation function, σOH is the contribution to the unconstrained conductivity arising from the proton–current–other (cation and anion) current correlation function, and σOO is the other current–other current contribution to the unconstrained conductivity.

One sees from Fig. 16 that the experimentally observed nonmonotonicity in the proton conductivity as a function of concentration is qualitatively reproduced. The proton concentration at which the calculated peak in conductivity occurs is close to the experimentally observed one, though the magnitude of the calculated conductivity is less than the magnitude of the experimentally observed conductivity by a factor of 4 to 5. A very small error in the activation energy of the relevant processes could account for the discrepancy in magnitude. We regard this as reasonable agreement, probably indicating that in the calculations, a process similar to the one occurring in the real fluid is determining the proton conductivity.

from test: 24 To try to understand the origin of the change at 17% acid concentration, we made a more detailed exploration of the configurations of the protons in the samples. We discovered that, in the calculations, some of the protons are paired in the computational samples with higher concentrations of protons. This pairing effect is visible in the proton–proton pair radial distribution functions for the 15- and 18 proton systems as shown in Fig. 18 and also in the snapshot in Fig. 19 (shown for one of the computational samples).

from test: 26 To try to understand the origin of the large fluctuations in calculated conductivity from one computational sample to another, in the case of the 18 proton system, we calculated the proton–proton radial distribution function for each of the 10 computational samples.

 ###### 
from test: 27 Clearly there are multiple ions present in these mixtures capable of contributing to the measured conductivity. For these materials to be useful in a fuel cell electrolyte, it is necessary that protons account for a sufficient fraction of the conductivity to allow the device to perform at high currents, and that other ions are not being transported in large quantities, which can create concentration gradients and degrade performance. In these dc, hydrogen pump measurements, the fact that no electrochemical reduction or oxidation of the electrolyte is observed during the experiments strongly suggests that most of the current is due to proton transport in these experiments. However, it does not rule out contributions to the measured conductivity from other ions as a result of the low-frequency variations in the field during the measurements, or as a result of very slow electrolyte reactions which could be occurring at the electrodes. It is possible that electrolyte concentration gradients are present during the measurements. The large increase in conductivity seen in the presence of the added acids compared to the pure ionic liquid strongly suggests that protonated species are responsible for the bulk of the charge transport. In the computations, if we assume that the EMI and TFSI are completely absorbed at the electrodes then we get a substantially different conductivity than if, as described in Appendix 3, and in the text, we impose the constraint that no EMI or TFSI current flows. This emulates the situation in the experiment, in which a concentration gradient is expected to reduce the net ionic currents to zero if the ions do not participate in faradaic reactions at the electrodes. From Fig. 17, where the effect of the constraint on the calculated conductivity is shown, one can see that the effect is small but not completely negligible.

 ###### 
from test: 28 We should also note that there is no assumption in our calculational model that the proton transport occurs through mass transport of individual protons from one electrode to the other. The possibility of Grotthuss-like processes is taken into account because the correlation functions of the total proton current are computed and these include the correlation of the velocity of each proton’s velocity with the velocity of all the other protons. [For example, one could imagine cases in which a TFSI anion is solvating a proton with two of its oxygens and a second proton moves to become solvated by the other two oxygens on that TFSI. If the first solvated proton were then induced to move to a different solvation shell involving different anions, the result would be collective charge transport in which two protons are involved (see the sketch in Fig. 21). A chain of such coupled motions could result in macroscopic transport of charge while each proton only moves a microscopic distance. This is an example of what is meant here by Grotthuss-like processes.] We explored the magnitudes of the contributions of the correlations the velocity of each proton with the velocity of different protons to the calculation of the conductivity, as a measure of the magnitude of such Grotthuss-like effects. We found the contributions to the calculated conductivity from correlation function of the form [vi(0)vj(t)] (i≠j) to be smaller than the contribution from the contributions of the form [vi(0)vi(t)] which determine the single-proton diffusion constant. Nevertheless, these contributions are included in the reported results.
from Soup: 28 The pairing phenomenon can also be described in terms of the potential of mean force Wmf=−kBTlngHH(r) , as shown for example in Fig. 20 . Minima are seen at around 2Å in simulations with 18 protons and more. In the simulations with 15 and fewer protons, minima appear at a proton–proton distance ⩾4Å .
 ###### 
from test: 29 Of the various ionic liquids on which experiments were done, the EMI–TFSI system showed the most promising conductivity for fuel cell applications. Our MD simulations reproduce the nonmonotonic behavior of the acid–ionic liquid system H-TFSI, EMI–TFSI as a function of ionic liquid concentration reasonably well (Fig. 16). However, this comparison does not fully explain the origin of the nonmonotonic behavior without further analysis. A hint of what may be happening is provided by the snapshots of the ion positions during the simulation after the proton conductivity has begun to decrease with increasing proton conductivity (Fig. 19). One sees some evidence that the protons are pairing. Looking more closely, we find that some paired protons are surrounded by an overscreening shell of TFSI anions. If clusters of protons and anions of this sort inhibit reduction of the proton at the cathode, then the effective proton conductivity (Appendix 3) would be reduced as the number of such clusters increased. One can make a simple model capturing this possibility as follows. Consider the reaction A− is the anion (here TFSI). In equilibriumand if y is the molecular percent ionic liquidand if the anion A− is common to the ionic liquid and the acidEliminating [(HmAn)m−n] from the last two equations givesand from the first equationUsing this in the equation for y giveswhich is straightforward to solve numerically for [H+] as a function of y . To model the resulting proton conductivity, we take into account that the proton mobility in the pure acid is very low. Linearly interpolating the mobility between the acid and the pure ionic liquid would then give a proton conductivity proportional to [H+]y . For m=4 , n=2 we find dependence on y quite similar to the experimental results with a small value of K′=0.008 , in Fig. 22. However, this model does not take account of any spatial correlations between ions which might conceivably be significant. The values m=4 , n=2 would imply a complex of two anions and four protons. This is consistent with the MD calculation indicating binding of each proton to four oxygens, two from each of two TFSI ions, though we have not studied such a cluster in any detail. We did observe a trimer of bound protons in one of the MD simulations. The model is too simplistic to be regarded as giving any detailed information about the nature of expected clusters. The results from the model are sensitive to the values of m and n however.

 ###### 
from test: 30 A similar but somewhat different possibility is that, at higher proton concentrations, the acid and the ionic liquid in these systems might be starting to phase separate. One can imagine a phase diagram in y-T space (y is the ionic liquid molar concentration and T is the absolute temperature) as sketched in Fig. 23. As one crosses into the two-phase region as the proton conductivity is increased, the system separates into an ionic liquid-rich and an acid-rich phase. Because the acid has a low proton conductivity, one expects the proton conductivity to be dominated by the ionic liquid-rich phase, but as one gets deeper into the two-phase region, less and less of the mixture consists of the ionic liquid-rich phase and the total conductivity would decrease, as observed. It is unlikely that our MD simulations are large enough to explicitly simulate such phase separations, and it is possible that the proton clustering we see in the simulations is a microscopic signature of it. One can make a simple mean-field-type model of the proton conductivity in such a phase separation model. Suppose that near the y=1 part of the phase diagram, in the ionic liquid-rich one-phase region, the proton conductivity follows the usual form (1−y)μHn associated with uncorrelated motion of protons. μH is the proton mobility and n is the average ionic density. When, with decreasing y at fixed T , the concentration reaches the two-phase region, the proton conductivity of the ionic liquid-rich region is assumed to remain at (1−y1)μHn=σ1 , while y continues to decrease. The total contribution of the ionic liquid-rich fraction of the two-phase mixture in that two-phase region is σ1(y−y2)∕(y1−y2) , where y2 is the other, ionic liquid-poor end of the constant temperature “tie line” in the assumed phase diagram. If the proton conductivity in the ionic liquid-rich phase is much larger than the proton conductivity in the acid-rich phase (which is consistent with the experiments), then the proton conductivity would have the form shown in Fig. 24, which is qualitatively consistent with several features of the experiments. The simple model does not take account of the requirement that the ionic liquid phase must contain a continuous conducting path across the sample. Because the densities of the two phases are likely to be different, if full equilibrium were achieved, then the higher density phase would be on the bottom of the container in unstirred equilibrium and such a path would exist. However, no indications of such phase separation are evident in the samples prepared for this experiment, even after they were stored for several months. Various bicontinuous phases might be imagined, though their stability over such a wide range of concentrations seems unlikely.
from Soup: 30 Clearly there are multiple ions present in these mixtures capable of contributing to the measured conductivity. For these materials to be useful in a fuel cell electrolyte, it is necessary that protons account for a sufficient fraction of the conductivity to allow the device to perform at high currents, and that other ions are not being transported in large quantities, which can create concentration gradients and degrade performance.

From Fig. 17 , where the effect of the constraint on the calculated conductivity is shown, one can see that the effect is small but not completely negligible.
 ###### 
from test: 31 In summary, though the phase separation model may be consistent with the simulations and provides a conduction concentration function much like the experimental ones, qualitative observation does not encourage the idea that these systems are phase separating and something like the other model as described above seems more likely to account for the observations. Though that monomer–trimer equilibrium model did not give as satisfactory an account of the shape of the concentration vs conductivity relation (though it was qualitatively correct), the model could be elaborated, for example by including equilibria between larger clusters as well. This will be explored further.
from Soup: 31 We should also note that there is no assumption in our calculational model that the proton transport occurs through mass transport of individual protons from one electrode to the other.

We found the contributions to the calculated conductivity from correlation function of the form [vi(0)vj(t)] (i≠j) to be smaller than the contribution from the contributions of the form [vi(0)vi(t)] which determine the single-proton diffusion constant. Nevertheless, these contributions are included in the reported results.
 ###### 
from test: 32 Another outstanding issue is the question of the origin of the attraction which is causing proton pairing in the simulations, as well as the question of whether evidence of such pairing can be observed experimentally. With regard to the former issue, there is a substantial literature on possible mechanisms of attraction of charged species of the same charge attracting each other in complex media. Mechanisms include entropic ones as well as mechanisms based on subtle complex screening effects. With regard to experimental observability of the pairs, we will explore the possibility that their presence might be detected in NMR experiments.

Though that monomer–trimer equilibrium model did not give as satisfactory an account of the shape of the concentration vs conductivity relation (though it was qualitatively correct), the model could be elaborated, for example by including equilibria between larger clusters as well. This will be explored further.

from test: 35 In the preliminary simulations described in the General Considerations section, entities (“protons”) were initially distributed at random on a simple cubic lattice with multiple occupancy forbidden. The model which described the simulated dynamics can be described byin which, for the model used to obtain the results shown in the top curve in Fig. 6, Wi+δ,i=0 unless i+δ is occupied and i is unoccupied, Wi+δ,i=0.5 if the neighbor δ is in a direction transverse to the field, Wi+δ,i=D∕(1+D) if the neighbor δ is in the direction along the field, and Wi+δ,i=1∕(1+D) if it is in the direction opposite to the field, with similar definitions for the Wi,i+δ . One may think of the field as proportional to lnD . For each concentration of protons, we can 230,000 steps (about 1064/site) on a 6×6×6=216 site lattice in which, in each step, a site was selected at random. If it contained a proton, a neighbor was selected at random and, if the neighboring site was empty, the proton was moved to the neighboring site with probability Wi,i+δ . If the site did not contain a proton and a randomly selected neighboring site was occupied, then the proton on the neighboring site was moved to the site with probability Wi+δ,i . Periodic boundary conditions were employed for the dynamics and the current was monitored by counting protons which moved in and out of the faces of the simulation box which were perpendicular to the field. Conductivities were determined by fitting the current data as a function of lnD , which were accurately linear, to a straight line. For the results shown in the middle curve in Fig. 6, the values of Wi+δ,i became D′∕(1+D′) , where D′=exp(sΔn)D (forward hops), D′=exp(sΔn)∕D (backward hops), and D′=exp(sΔn) (transverse hops). Here, s is a parameter and Δn is the difference between the number of occupied neighbors of i+δ and the number of occupied neighbors of i . For the results shown in the bottom curve in Fig. 6, all the hopping rates W were reduced by a factor exp(−f×ΣN) , where f was a parameter and ΣN was the sum of the number of occupied neighbors of i+δ and the number of occupied neighbors of i .
from Soup: 35 Another outstanding issue is the question of the origin of the attraction which is causing proton pairing in the simulations, as well as the question of whether evidence of such pairing can be observed experimentally. With regard to the former issue, there is a substantial literature on possible mechanisms of attraction of charged species of the same charge attracting each other in complex media. Mechanisms include entropic ones as well as mechanisms based on subtle complex screening effects. With regard to experimental observability of the pairs, we will explore the possibility that their presence might be detected in NMR experiments.

from test: 36 The force-field model can be described in the following functional formwhere the first three terms are for intramolecular interactions, including bond stretching, bending, and torsion terms, and the last two terms are for nonbonded interactions, including Lennard-Jones and coulomb interactions terms. We determined the short-range force-field parameters describing bonding interactions by fitting the model to a variety of distorted ion and cluster configuration energies as calculated from first principles as described in detail below. Because the first-principles methods we used do not take correct account of dispersion forces, we used empirical values for the Lennard-Jones nonbonded interactions. We took these Lennard-Jones parameters for like atomic types from Ref. 22 and obtained those for different atom types by use of the Lorentz–Berthelot mixing rule. This procedure is approximate but is not inconsistent because we only include Lennard-Jones and coulomb contributions to the forces in the MD model between atoms on different molecules and between atoms in same molecule but separated by at least three bonds.

(We checked the optimized structure with the larger basis set 6-311++G** , and found, as shown in Tables XI and XII, that the difference is very small. In the same tables, structural results from X-ray experiments23 are also compared with our results for the single ion.) We next made distortions of the positions of each atom from the computed equilibrium structure, by randomly displacing each atom in a randomly selected direction and by a distance randomly drawn from a uniform distribution in the interval ±0.01Å . In this way we generated 500 distorted atomic configurations of the EMI ion, and 200 distorted atomic configurations of the TFSI ion with C2 symmetry and 200 distorted configurations for the TFSI with C1 symmetry. (TFSI has two stable structures,24 one of C2 symmetry and the other of C1 symmetry as shown in Fig. B-1.) For each distorted ion structure the energy was recomputed at the HF∕6-31G* level and added to the database. To take account of the possibility of transitions between the two TFSI structures, energies were also calculated for distortions in which rotations about the two central N–S bonds were carried out. The resulting energy surface is shown in Fig. B-2, where the two local minima are labeled X1 and X2. From the energy surface we extracted the direct transition path from point X1 to point X2. We included energies of 90 configurations of the TFSI ion on the direct transition in the fitting database.

First, we carried out calculations on the EMI–TFSI to obtain the most stable configuration. Then, starting with this configuration, we fixed the position of TFSI and rotated the EMI to obtain 64 configurations as follows. We chose a coordinate system in which the center of mass of the EMI and atoms 3 and 5 on the ring define the x–y plane with the origin at the center of mass of EMI and with atom 3 along the x axis. Using this coordinate system, we then rotated the EMI around its center of mass with the Euler angles α,β,γ , where α=0 , π∕4,⋯,7π∕4 ; β=0 ; γ=0 , π∕4,⋯,7π∕4 for a total of 64 configurations. The Euler angles were defined using the convention in Ref. 25.

from test: 45 In the condensed phase, covalency will result in a reduced charge on the anion and cation. To take approximate account of this effect, we used the electrostatic potential from the first-principles calculations on an EMI–TFSI ion pair in the RESP procedure. The computed total charges on EMI and TFSI are +0.67 and −0.67 , respectively. In general, the partial charge transfer will be different for the proton than for the EMI, and we have here assumed that they are the same. This assumption is not so well justified and is made to avoid complicating the model. To take account of changes in charge transfer when the TFSI is near a proton rather than near EMI would require an MD model in which the charges are dynamical variables. Such models exist for other systems but they involve nonstandard MD techniques, require further code building, run more slowly than standard techniques, and there is no consensus concerning their reliability. Our first-principles calculations on the TFSI–H-TFSI system as described in the text gave a Mulliken proton charge of +0.7021 ∣e∣ at the lowest energy atomic configuration, so the errors made in making this assumption are not large. The calculated partial charges on each atom are listed in Table XIII.

from test: 51 In the experiments, the EMI and TFSI ion currents are not collected. A steady state is established in which the protons carry current but EMI and TFSI ions do not. We impose the condition of zero EMI and TFSI current by envisioning carrying out the calculation in the presence of an extra term in the Hamiltonian of the system, which is the product of a constant times the polarization arising from the EMI and TFSI ions. The constant, which has the dimensions of an electric field E′ , may be regarded as a Lagrange multiplier to be used in the standard manner to impose a constraint in the application of the principle of least action to determine the equations of motion of the fluid in the presence of a (real) electric field E . More physically, the field E′ takes account in the simulation of the effects of the concentration gradients in the anions and cations which result from the constraint, so that the competition of drift (due to E ) and diffusion (taken into account in the simulation by E′ ) results in zero anion and cation current. It turns out that no MD calculation in the presence of an extra field is required. We can determine the correction to the calculated conductivity from features of the zero-field MD calculation as follows: Let the polarization operator of the protons be PH=∑HqHrH and the polarization of the other ions (here EMI and TFSI) be PO=∑OqOr . (Only time derivatives of these operators appear in the expressions for the conductivity, so we need not be concerned with issues arising concerning the zero of the displacement vectors.)

from test: 52 Interest in membrane materials for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells has recently increased because of the international effort to improve fuel cell performance, particularly for automotive applications and the move toward a possible hydrogen economy.1 In particular, there are strong engineering reasons2 to seek a proton conducting membrane which will work at higher temperatures (up to 120°C ) and/or at a lower water content than possible with the polyperfluorosulfonic acid polymers being used today, such as DuPont’s Nafion. Membranes of this type are highly dependent on water for proton conduction. At higher temperatures (90°C) or lower cell humidification levels, the membrane water content is much lower and the conductivity drops dramatically, so these two goals are closely related. Though a variety of other polymeric membrane materials has been explored, none has yielded the desired improvements in performance.3

from test: 53 For these reasons, another membrane material, possibly containing a nonaqueous, nonvolatile plasticizer with a high conductivity would be desirable. Some previous work reported studies of ionic liquids as possible additives to fuel cell electrolytes.4–7 Somewhat similar systems containing polymers, ionic liquids, and lithium salts8, 9 have been investigated for use in lithium polymer batteries (see also Ref. 10). In the study reported here, we studied mixtures of acids with a bulky anion and ionic liquids in which both the cation and anion were relatively large. This contrasts with some earlier studies (e.g., Ref. 7) in which the focus is on ionic liquids containing one anionic and one cationic species. The motivation for this choice was the hope that, in such acid–ion liquid mixtures, the proton mobility would be enhanced and that, in particular, this might be particularly the case when the two components in the mixture had a common anion. We do find cases in which such enhancement of proton conductivity occurs in mixtures with a common anion, and we report details of a study of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EMI, C6H11N2 )–bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [TFSI, (CF3SO2)2N ] which has a high conductivity at temperatures below 100°C at certain acid–salt ratios (Fig. 1).
from test: 54 The dependence of conductivity on the acid–salt ratio is unexpected: The largest measured conductivity is at large salt–acid ratios and declines over most of the concentration range as the proton concentration increases. Viscosity measurements showed that the “Walden rule” does not apply, even qualitatively: There is no simple correlation between the viscosity and the conductivity. We report a detailed molecular dynamics model whose use in a simulation reproduces the observed behavior and discuss an interpretation in terms of the formation of bound proton clusters as the proton concentration increases.
