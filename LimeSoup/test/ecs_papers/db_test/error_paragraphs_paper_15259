from test: 10 For data parameterization by a complex non-linear least squares (CNLS) fitting routine (software: Z-View, Scribner, USA) the simple equivalent circuit in Figure 2 was chosen. The series resistance R_spread is mainly caused by the spreading resistance of ion conduction in the YSZ electrolyte,36 while the second resistance R_Pol is attributed to the electrode's polarization resistance. To account for the depression of the electrode arc a constant phase element (CPE) was used in the circuit instead of a capacitor. (Please note: Modeling the slight asymmetry of the electrode feature by an additional R/CPE element was not straightforwardly possible – this easily lead to over-parameterization and was thus omitted.) The impedance of a CPE element is defined as with Q0 the admittance value at ω = 1 s− 1, i the imaginary unit, ω the angular frequency and n a number between -1 (ideal inductance) and 1 (ideal capacitance). In a CNLS fit Q0 and n are usually used as fitting parameters. Since in this work values of n are between 0.88 and 0.96 and therefore sufficiently close to 1, the constant phase element can be interpreted in terms of a non-ideal capacitor. The corresponding capacitance can be calculated by the formula37 with R being the resistance parallel to the CPE-element. Throughout this paper only capacitance values obtained by Eq. 2 will be discussed and referred to as electrode capacitance.

from test: 11 In order to determine the geometry dependence of the electrode capacitance, electrodes of different area but equal triple phase boundary (TPB) lengths were electrochemically characterized. The shapes of these electrodes are different as shown in Figure 1a. For this measurement series the TPB length of the electrodes was evaluated as lTPB = 2.73 ± 0.11 mm. The scattering of lTPB can be regarded as rather small compared to the variation of the area, which covered a range of 0.09 mm² to 0.5 mm². A plot of capacitance values as a function of electrode area for two different contacting needles is shown in Figure 3a and linear regression parameters are given in Table I. The graph indicates that for both Pt and Ni needles a linear relationship between capacitance and area holds true. Comparison of the slopes shows no significant difference between the two needles (t-test assuming equal variance; p = 0.15). For both an area-specific capacitances of about 3 F/m2 is found. The 95% confidence interval for the C-intercept are (−5.1 ± 2.8)·10−8 F for the Ni needle and (−6.6 ± 2.0)·10−8 F for the Pt needle, respectively. The intercept is therefore indeed statistically significantly below 0. This negative intercept may originate from an electrode area that does not contribute to the capacitance; a likely candidate may be the area covered by the contacting needle. Another measurement series was performed on circular microelectrodes of different diameter at 750°C in 2.5% H2/2% H2O/balance Ar (Figure 3b). In this series, electrodes had the same shape but areas as well as TPB lengths varied. Essentially, the same results as for series 1 (Figure 3a) were found: a small intercept and a linear relation between capacitance and area. Hence, when neglecting the small axis intercept we can conclude from these measurements that the area specific electrode capacitance does neither depend on the size of the electrode nor on its shape.

from test: 12 A typical effect of hydrogen sulfide on the capacitance of Ni electrodes with and without YSZ cover at 800°C is shown in Figure 4. It can be seen that upon addition of 10 ppm H2S to the feed gas the capacitance of all electrodes decreases within the experimental time resolution of ∼25 min. After removal of H2S in the gas feed the capacitance quickly increases and eventually returns to values similar to pre-poisoning conditions. The plot in Figure 5 compares pristine and poisoned capacitance values for different electrode sizes of non-covered electrodes. The graph shows that capacitances under H2S still follow a linear relationship with the area, but with a significantly lower slope (i.e. ASC) compared to the pre-poisoned values. Detailed results of the linear regressions are given in Table I. It should be noted that the measurement series “Ni needle Figure 3” and “Pre-S-exposure Figure 5” were measured under the same conditions on different samples and show very similar slopes. This difference in slope is not statistically significant (p = 0.82) which demonstrates the reproducibility of the measurements.

from test: 14 Impedance spectra for DC bias values ranging from −400 mV to +250 mV at various voltage steps were recorded for two water partial pressures with electrodes of different size. Besides small low-frequency inductive loops under high bias voltages (not included in the fit), the spectrum shape under bias voltage did not change compared to the unpolarized electrode. The resulting electrode capacitance was obtained by the fitting procedure discussed above and is plotted versus the bias voltage in Figure 7. Due to small counter electrode and electrolyte resistances the bias voltage is virtually identical to the overpotential at the Ni electrode. In the highly cathodic regime the capacitance increases strongly upon stronger polarization with little to no hysteresis, while in the other regime a moderately positive association between bias voltage and electrode capacitance with a kind of hysteresis can be found. This rather complex bias dependence is independent of the electrode size (Figure 7b, logarithmic plot), but turns out to be oxygen partial pressure dependent. Figure 7a shows that the curve shifts on the bias voltage axis for different water contents in the measurement atmosphere. For 2% water the minimum capacitance shifts −125 mV compared to the 0.15% water measurement. The voltage difference is thus in good agreement with the Nernst voltage between the atmospheres (−120 mV). This suggests that the transition between the two distinct capacitive regimes can be expressed in terms of an equilibrium oxygen partial pressure without additional bias voltage; a pressure of 7 · 10− 24 bar results. Differences in absolute electrode capacitance values are largely due to different electrode areas.

from test: 17 The most well-known type of electrochemical double layer is the Helmholtz double layer. In this model the interface capacitance can be calculated as for a plate capacitor and, assuming εr = 10 and d = 250 pm (the diameter of an oxide ion), an ASC in the range of 0.35 F/m² would be expected. Since the experimental value of ∼3 F/m² is almost an order of magnitude higher than the expected value, it can be concluded that a Helmholtz double layer is not the (main) source of the observed electrode capacitance. Similar conclusions have been reached in Refs. 33, 34 also assuming the 1 nm thin interfacial layer in Figure 9 to act as an insulating oxide can hardly explain the capacitance. Its relative permittivity would have to be ∼400 and thus far beyond values expected for typical interfacial phases (e.g. SiOx).

from test: 18 As for diffuse double layer models ions cannot approach the metal surface closer than in the Helmholtz model, the upper limit of predicted capacitances of such models is again the capacitance of the Helmholtz model. This fact is also reflected in the Stern model.41 The diffuse space charge layer model described by Hendriks et al.35 is a modified Gouy-Chapman model with only one mobile species and oxygen vacancy concentration limitation. However, since it does not include metal approach limitation and interaction of oxygen vacancies its applicability is limited and not appropriate in our case.

from test: 20 An alternative to the classical electrostatic capacitance models described above are capacitors based on faradaic processes with accumulation of reactants – often referred to as chemical capacitances. Since the measured capacitance scales linearly with the Ni electrode area this accumulation has to occur either at the Ni surface, or in the Ni bulk or at the interface between Ni and YSZ.

from test: 21 Since sulfur exposure does affect the electrode capacitance and is well-known in the SOFC community for adsorption on the Ni surface,42 surface adsorbates as a reservoir of redox active species are firstly discussed as a possible explanation of the capacitive behavior. In this case, any substantial concentration change of adsorbed species would show a great impact on the capacitance. Modifying the surface of the Ni electrode by deposition of YSZ on top does not have a significant influence on the ASC. It can therefore be concluded that adsorbates on the Ni surface cannot explain the observed capacitive behavior. However, sulfur is also known to dissolve in Ni (under measurement conditions ∼40 ppm43) and then to segregate to the grain boundaries.44 Hence, dissolved sulfur could also change concentrations of species in the bulk and/or at the Ni/YSZ interface and thereby affect the observed capacitance. One can assume that such a diffusion process of sulfur might take some time and causes a delay in the capacitance change after sulfur exposure. However, since our gas exchange and measurement time was in the range of 25 minutes, we may easily miss this time dependence. The instantaneous change seen in Figure 4 is thus possibly only an apparent one. The effect of sulfur on the ASC was not affected by a YSZ cover layer on the Ni electrode. This either means that diffusion of sulfur species through Ni is still possible due to some cracks in the YSZ cover layer or that the sulfur diffusion anyway takes place primarily along the YSZ/Ni interface. In the latter case, rather fast sulfur diffusion is required; this is conceivable since the fast sulfur surface diffusion on Ni was also reported in literature.45
from Soup: 21 Since sulfur exposure does affect the electrode capacitance and is well-known in the SOFC community for adsorption on the Ni surface, 42 surface adsorbates as a reservoir of redox active species are firstly discussed as a possible explanation of the capacitive behavior. In this case, any substantial concentration change of adsorbed species would show a great impact on the capacitance. Modifying the surface of the Ni electrode by deposition of YSZ on top does not have a significant influence on the ASC. It can therefore be concluded that adsorbates on the Ni surface cannot explain the observed capacitive behavior. However, sulfur is also known to dissolve in Ni (under measurement conditions ∼40 ppm 43 ) and then to segregate to the grain boundaries. 44 Hence, dissolved sulfur could also change concentrations of species in the bulk and/or at the Ni/YSZ interface and thereby affect the observed capacitance. One can assume that such a diffusion process of sulfur might take some time and causes a delay in the capacitance change after sulfur exposure. However, since our gas exchange and measurement time was in the range of 25 minutes, we may easily miss this time dependence. The instantaneous change seen in Figure 4 is thus possibly only an apparent one. The effect of sulfur on the ASC was not affected by a YSZ cover layer on the Ni electrode.

from test: 22 In the following, five possible types of chemical capacitances are considered which either originate in the bulk (III) or at the Ni/YSZ interface (I, II, IV, V). Each mechanism is discussed not only in terms of its ability to explain the absolute ASC values, but also in the light of the bias dependency of the electrode capacitance since the bias effect exhibits two distinct regions – a linear region below an equilibrium oxygen partial pressure of 7 · 10− 24 bar without hysteresis and a region of weaker bias-dependency but with hysteresis above 7 · 10− 24 bar oxygen. This could indicate a switch in the dominant capacitive mechanism, which due to lacking discontinuities in the bias dependency graph is probably not caused by a phase change.

from test: 23 Oxide non-stoichiometry: The most common mechanism leading to chemical capacitances of mixed conducting SOFC cathodes is based on oxygen stoichiometry change. Even though nickel electrodes are not mixed oxide ion/electron conductors, a similar effect might take place for example in the interlayer at the Ni/YSZ boundary, particularly if an oxide with reducible ions is present. (For Ni1-xO, however, mechanism IV, which is based on a phase formation rather than on a pure stoichiometry change, is regarded as more probable – see below). The chemical capacitance due to such an oxygen stoichiometry change can be estimated by where e is the elementary charge, zi is the number of charges per charge carrier, kB the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, s the thickness of the corresponding layer and ci the minority charge carrier concentration involved in the process, typically either oxygen vacancies or electrons or electron holes.46 However, oxygen non-stoichiometry in the 1 nm thin layer of unknown composition, visible in HT-TEM, could only lead to such a high capacitance if its electron concentration was larger than 1021 cm− 3.

A strongly related option of a chemical capacitance is based on stoichiometry changes in YSZ. In air, contributions of YSZ to any chemical capacitance via oxide stoichiometric changes are negligible due to very low concentrations of electronic charge carriers. In hydrogen, however, electron concentrations in YSZ are enhanced and they further increase upon cathodic polarization. For a cathodic polarization of −250 mV in the measurement atmosphere with 0.15% water (equilibrium oxygen partial pressure of pO2=3.2·10−26bar ) a YSZ electron concentration of [ e ] = 1.1 · 10 20 cm − 3 can be estimated. 47 According to Equation 3 the measured ASC would thus require stoichiometry changes in a YSZ layer with a thickness of only ∼15 nm assuming constant electrochemical potentials in this region. A further analysis including the exact potential distribution in the YSZ is beyond the scope of this study. Yet this estimate shows that such a mechanism is plausible, at least for the negative voltages without capacitance hysteresis. It would also be in qualitative agreement with the increase of the capacitance for higher cathodic voltages.

from Soup: 24 Interface impurities: A mechanism involving valence changes of impurities segregated to the Ni/YSZ interface was suggested by Hansen et al. 34 In their study, point electrodes, which are Ni wires pressed onto a YSZ substrate, were used. This approach led to significant impurity segregation, which even resulted in impurity ridges. Yet the thin-film electrodes used in our study exhibit a much more favorable surface-to-volume ratio and were prepared from highly pure Ni; the effect of impurity segregation, if there is any, should therefore be greatly reduced. While significantly lower amounts of impurities were found on our electrodes (compare Figure 9 ), ASC values are comparable to values in Ref. 34 therefore this mechanism is very unlikely.

from Soup: 25 Ni bulk as H reservoir: For the Ni bulk as determining factor of the ASC, changes in hydrogen concentration were the likely capacitive mechanism. Dissolved hydrogen could diffuse from the bulk to the triple phase boundary, be oxidized there and desorb as water according to 2 H Ni + O x O → H 2 O + V · · O + 2 e ′ Ni . (Mechanisms with hydrogen oxidation at the entire Ni/YSZ interface are discussed below.) In order to act purely capacitive, hydrogen concentration changes in the Ni bulk have to be accompanied by a fast reaction at the triple phase boundary. This is in contradiction to the rate limiting reaction at the triple phase boundary assumed for the resistances of Ni/YSZ electrodes. 11 , 30 Hence, this mechanism appears very unlikely.

from Soup: 26 Protons at the interface: Another possible mechanism (also mentioned in Ref. 33 ) is based on the H/H + redox reaction HNi+OOx⇄OHO·+eNi′ . Since protons are hardly soluble in the bulk of YSZ grains, 48 it is very likely that they can only be stored very close to the surface of a YSZ single crystal, i.e. in an interlayer between Ni and YSZ. For electroneutral incorporation of protons into this layer without drastic change of the electron concentration, also the oxygen vacancy concentration in this interface layer has to change. Actually, the proton concentration change can be considered as a consequence of the water activity variation at the interface and is determined by the defect equation H2O+VO··+OOx⇄2OHO. . The water activity varies since the oxygen activity in YSZ varies by the voltage while the hydrogen content in Ni is fixed by the atmosphere. According to Equation 3 the minority charge carrier concentration in a 1 nm thick layer would have to be 1.7 · 10 21 cm − 3 to explain an ASC of 3 F/m², which corresponds to ∼3 mol% with respect to oxygen sites in bulk YSZ. Since this is already close to the oxygen vacancy concentration, c i in Equation 3 should be replaced by cOH.·4cVO../(cOH.+4cVO..) , 46 but still realistic concentration values result.The effect of sulfur exposure on the electrode capacitance could be explained by S at the Ni/YSZ interface stabilizing or occupying oxygen vacancies and thereby hindering the dissolution of protons in the YSZ as OH · O . This mechanism is thus a second viable candidate to explain the absolute values of the ASC found here; the effect of the voltage would depend on the other charge carrier ( V · · O or OH · O ).

from Soup: 27 Local oxidation of Ni: This mechanism involves the formation of interfacial nickel oxide Ni 1-x O with unknown Ni content. In principle, variation of the Ni stoichiometry in Ni 1-x O can lead to a chemical capacitance as does oxygen variation in mechanism I. Owing to the absence of a Ni ion conducting electrolyte, however, oxide ions have to be involved in any defect chemical change of an interfacial Ni 1-x O layer, i.e. formation of additional Ni (1-x+y)/2 O is required: Bulk nickel oxide decomposes below a pO2 of ∼10 −14 bar at 800°C 49 and thus should not be present. Interfacial Ni 1-x O, however, might be stable also in the pO2 regime considered here and may change its stoichiometry and Ni chemical potential by forming additional Ni (1-x+y)/2 O according to the reaction shown above. Since rather large deviations of x,y from 1 might be involved, large chemical capacitances are easily conceivable. The interfacial layer visible in Figure 9 could be such a Ni 1-x O layer. A similar capacitive mechanism has previously been suggested for Pt/YSZ electrodes in air. 50 – 52 Sulfur at the interface may affect the formation of such a Ni 1-x O layer and can thus influence the capacitance. At some low pO2 also interfacial Ni 1-x O is expected to decompose and this kind of chemical capacitance should disappear at sufficiently negative voltages. This mechanism may therefore govern the bias range representing higher pO2 values. The need for severe structural changes in this reaction may also explain the observed hysteresis in this range of Figure 7 . Henceforth, this model is a very realistic candidate for explaining the capacitive behavior at polarizations above the equilibrium oxygen partial pressure of 7 · 10 − 24 bar. For lower pressures either mechanism I or IV are considered to be most realistic.
