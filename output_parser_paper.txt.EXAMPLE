    Content: 
        Polyaniline (PANI) has been studied for some years in order to protect mild steels against corrosion in the absence of inorganic conversion layers. During the electropolymerization of PANI film, iron is passivated; the subsequent protection is dependent on the nature of this passive layer, and PANI acts as a stabilizer of this layer. The best conditions for PANI electrodeposition are discussed here, using a simple electrochemical test to characterize the passivity breakdown. © 2000 The Electrochemical Society.

    Content: 
        Iron rods (Goodfellow) annealed for 1 week at 1000°C under vacuum were isolated with a cataphoretic lacquer to avoid corrosion at the electrode edges. The choice of optimum PANI deposition conditions is the object of this first part and will be analyzed in the following.
        The corrosion test solution was 0.1 M K2SO4 with an admixture of H2SO4 up to the chosen pH (4.5 to 0.5). A saturated sulfate reference electrode (SSE) was used. A galvanostatic test is used; the duration corresponding to the loss of protection, tc, is estimated by the sharp fall of the open-circuit potential, Voc, from the value corresponding to passivity (V>−300 mV/SSE) to the corrosion potential (V< −950 mV/SSE). After the potential fall, PANI continues to protect iron by a simple polymer barrier effect, but this effect was not considered.
        The results are presented without specific regard for low or high pH; the progress which was obtained in the PANI deposition can be estimated by the lowering of the solution pH in which the sample can be left with tc exceeding several hours. Small differences in the experimental conditions have been employed during this study, leading to a certain dispersion in the tc values (in particular at pH 0.5).

After preliminary experiments, a potentiostatic electropolymerization at 300 mV/SSE was chosen. A large number of solutions (more or less concentrated organic and inorganic acids) were tested; we compared the protective properties of polymer films formed in 0.2 to 1 M sulfuric acid+0.3 M aniline, 1 to 3 M phosphoric acid+0.1 to 0.6 M aniline, and 0.1 to 0.5 M oxalic acid+0.1 M aniline. The best results obtained after polymerization in each of these acids are given in Fig. 2 (pH 4.5), which displays the superiority of the phosphoric medium. All the following results are obtained in 1.7 M phosphoric solution.', 'Improvement of PANI conductivity was expected from the addition of small amounts of camphorsulfonic (CSA) or metanilic acids. Figure 3 (pH 1) shows that, while HCSA was inactive, 0.05 M metanilic acid gave a large effect, with a smoothing of the polymer surface [observed in scanning electron microscopy (SEM)]. A shift of the passivation potential down to 200 mV extends the passive range of potentials where electropolymerization of aniline takes place without formation of overoxidized species (V< 350 mV/SSE). The formation of an anilic-metanilic “copolymer” cannot be excluded, and the smoothing of the surface could be then related to the more planar geometry of the metanilic acid molecule.', 'Temperature has a strong influence on PANI quality. 17 An Arrhenius plot for PANI electrodeposition on iron gave an apparent activation energy of 33.5 kJ mol −1 ; deposition at too high a speed leads to a porous and nonadherent layer, as shown by SEM. Therefore, this temperature is controlled at the lowest value compatible with a reasonable deposition time; a compromise at 23°C was chosen. It is important to have thermostatic control during the deposition, because a difference of 2°C in the ambient temperature is enough to cause significant thickness differences.', 'Another important parameter is the presence of oxygen in solution. Figure 4 (pH 2) compares two samples electropolymerized in the same phosphoric solution, but in one of the two cases the solution was deaerated: the result is obviously worse, which displays the importance of obtaining a highly oxidized polymer form. If this layer is exposed to the atmosphere for several days, as shown in Fig. 5 (pH 2), it recovers good protective properties by way of a slow polymer reoxidation. Once the optimum properties are recovered, if the sample is left in air for more time (without mechanical top protection and exposed to the atmosphere of a chemical laboratory) degradation can occur, leading to a decrease of tc after 3 weeks.', 'The stabilization of passivity with PANI grown in phosphoric acid is clearly established. In oxalic medium, PANI appears green; i.e. , a metallic form is deposited. In phosphoric medium, it is blue to purple, corresponding to an oxidized bipolaronic form. These differences can be related to the properties of the underlying iron compound since it is known that iron is only poorly passivated in organic media. It is an oxisalt interfacial layer (mainly iron oxalate) which is formed in oxalic acid with only a poor protective character; 10 the fall of Voc after immersion in the corrosion test solution of an iron sample passivated for 1 h in 0.5 M oxalic acid without aniline is immediate. For this reason, Lacroix et al. have favored a bilayer system in which PANI is deposited on a thin polypyrrole surface layer, 18 which is another way to reinforce the interface.', 'After selection of the solution composition leading to the best corrosion strength; 1.7 M H3PO4, 0.1 M metanilic acid, 0.3 M aniline, improvement of the passive layer formed on iron in this solution before polymerization was sought.']}]
        [{'type': 'section_h3', 'name': 'Improvement of iron passivation', 'content': ['The passivation potential for iron in phosphoric solution is 900 mV/SSE, rather far from the polymerization potential. It was therefore judicious to passivate the sample in the phosphoric solution without aniline before adding the aniline and starting the polymerization. It was shown by Raman spectroscopy 19 that the passive films grown in 0.5 M sulfuric or 1 M phosphoric solutions evolve toward more crystallization and thicken during several hours. Figure 6 (pH 1) displays the importance of forming a strong passive layer. As shown in the inset, tc values increase rapidly with the thickening (first hour), and then more slowly with the recrystallization of the passive layer. It was not possible in these experimental conditions to show the formation of oxysalt; nuclear measurements (oxygen titration) showed that the layer was as thin as any iron passive layer (≪100 nm); however, it is probable that the passive layer is also an oxysalt including phosphate anions. Contrarily to oxalates, these phosphate anions must have a beneficial effect on the iron strength; one knows the important role played by phosphatation conversion layers on galvanized steels.', 'A further improvement of the corrosion strength can be obtained by careful control of the iron surface before passivation; Fig. 7 a and b (pH 0.5) show the influence of potential and time of cathodic reduction. For a given potential (−1080 mV/SSE) the cathodic cleaning must be carried on up to 5 min, afterward, there is no improvement, and for a given time (5 min), the optimum effect is obtained at −1280 mV/SSE. A potential of −1180 mV/SSE is chosen to avoid any risk of H diffusion into iron.', 'It was suggested that an iron treatment at high temperature (200°C) would be able to restore the protection properties by reoxidizing the iron; 7 however the conduction properties of PANI change drastically with the temperature, 20 and it would be necessary to study this process more thoroughly.']}]
        [{'type': 'section_h3', 'name': 'Choice of PANI thickness', 'content': ['The determination of the thickness of a polymer is not easy. In the case of platinum, it was verified that the same charge passing during the electrodeposition corresponded to the same thickness measured with SEM (at 23°C, 100 mC corresponds to 100 nm). On iron, the electrodeposition charge is counted only when a monomer is added to the solution. The thicknesses are compared using SEM (in the case of iron, at 23°C, 120 mC corresponds to 100 nm). Therefore, the thickness of polymers is generally characterized by the charge passed during their polymerization.', 'The choice of PANI thickness resulted from a rather critical compromise. As shown in Fig. 8 (pH 0.5), tc increases with the film thickness, but, after a thickness of ∼500 nm, there a loss of adhesion evidenced by a detachment of the layer during rinsing. To be sure of the good adhesion of the layer, a charge not exceeding 250 mC cm −2 is preferred.']}]

        [{'type': 'section_h3', 'name': 'Influence of oxygen in corrosion solution', 'content': ['The PANI film is electrodeposited in its oxidized state (Fig. 4 showed that the presence of dissolved oxygen in the electrodeposition solution doubles the protection time), and we tried to determine if the protection is only due to this positive charge reservoir (oxidized PANI being a source of reducible species) or if the system can be self-sustained by the presence of dissolved oxygen in solution. Figure 9 compares tc in aerated and deaerated solutions at pH 2.', 'We also measured the passive current Ipass, on iron in corrosion test solution, and tried to determine the oxidative charge of the polymer in the same solution. Since it is impossible to discharge totally the polymer on an iron electrode because the corrosion current that appears below the Flade potential is very high, we grew approximately the same film on platinum, with the same deposition solution and a layer thickness of 300 nm, checked by SEM measurement. The voltammogram of this film on platinum was recorded, and the positive charge available, Qfilm, was estimated by integration of the voltammogram peak. The expected protection time, tcalc, is estimated from the relation Qfilm=Ipasstcalc in the different solutions, aerated and deaerated in the 0.5 to 2 pH range. These different values are given in Table I . In Fig. 10 , tcalc (open symbols) is plotted together with the experimental times (full symbols). The experimental times correspond to the mean values found in the different experiments. Clearly, the oxidation of the PANI film is maintained by the presence of oxygen in solution; at pH 2, the protection time is increased by an order of magnitude with respect to the expected value. The beneficial effect of environmental oxygen was expected from the first studies; 4 it is obviously more ambiguous when the film is covered by a top coat. 11']}]

    Content: 
        Because of the need to have a good quality interface between the passive layer and PANI, an efficient protection cannot be obtained by casting of a blend, as is assumed in the literature; 21 even if some passivation of the iron surface can be obtained by this simple contact, it cannot be controlled with enough rigor. The deposition in an organic acid solution, also proposed in the literature, is not satisfying, and, in spite of the greater difficulty, it is necessary to use a concentrated strong acid for PANI electrodeposition.
        The relationship is obvious between the protection brought by PANI and the structure of the underlying passive layer. Significant improvement of the tc value was obtained by an extended growth of the passive film (preceded by a strong cathodic cleaning of the iron surface), before the start of polymerization. The role of PANI is therefore to stabilize and strengthen the passive film, playing the role of a “chemical potentiostat.” Therefore, once corrosion has started, it can have a repairing effect on pinholes 12 but not on larger defects; in a pH 4.5 solution, the passage of a current of 1 μA cm −2 is enough to reduce the protection time from 1 month to 1 h. This is obviously insufficient to repassivate a real iron electrode. Although modifications of the PANI properties along a scratch done on the coating were observed, showing a repairing effort, iron corrosion products accumulated in the scratch. 22
        Here, the study was essentially done under rather harsh conditions (very acidic solutions), but it is obvious that at high pH values, PANI can bring a spectacular improvement with respect to the passive film; these are the conditions under which it equilibrates spontaneously in an oxidized/insulating form (EB, PB). The future applications of PANI in corrosion-protection problems are therefore essentially expected in tap waters and related conditions, and require of course the addition of a top layer.
        In the next part, Raman and optical spectroscopic analysis 23 will be used to give a full characterization of the PANI films grown in phosphoric medium, and to understand the reactions in PANI preceding and accompanying the passivity breakdown. We will see that the loss of protection, corresponding to the reduced state of the polymer, is due to a progressive decrease of its oxidation followed by a sharp loss of its reoxidation capability associated with the breakdown of the passive layer.
